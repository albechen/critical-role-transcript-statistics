MATT: Hello and good evening, everyone, and
welcome to tonight's episode of Critical Role, a

00:00:04.826 --> 00:00:09.459
show where a bunch of us nerdy-ass voice actors
play D&amp;amp;D, Dungeons &amp;amp; Dragons. Roll dice and kill

00:00:09.459 --> 00:00:13.309
monsters and sometimes maybe get killed
themselves. I don't know.

00:00:13.309 --> 00:00:16.743
(yelling)

00:00:16.743 --> 00:00:21.767
MATT: Because it's fun to set the tone. It's fun.
But yeah, so anyway. Thank you guys for joining

00:00:21.767 --> 00:00:27.888
us, old and new, welcome to our chaos. We have a
few announcements to get through before we start

00:00:27.888 --> 00:00:33.277
tonight's game. First and foremost, for those who
haven't seen, we've been putting up Spotify

00:00:33.277 --> 00:00:39.987
playlists compiled by our different players here.
And this week we had Vex, Laura, put up her

00:00:39.987 --> 00:00:44.833
playlist. Which is awesome. If you want to say
something about your playlist and some cool stuff

00:00:44.833 --> 00:00:46.565
they can look forward to?

00:00:46.565 --> 00:00:53.989
LAURA: Just that it's the coolest. No, it's
actually weirdly personal to put it together and

00:00:53.989 --> 00:01:02.249
put it up. It feels like you're baring your soul.
So I hope you guys enjoy my soul. And also, song

00:01:02.249 --> 00:01:04.877
three, which is like... everything.

00:01:04.877 --> 00:01:07.697
MARISHA: That one might have made me cry a little
bit.

00:01:07.697 --> 00:01:08.610
LAURA: Right?

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:09.686
MARISHA: Yeah, just a little.

00:01:09.686 --> 00:01:12.328
LAURA: I may or may not have been thinking of the
Critters while I was picking that song. Just so

00:01:12.328 --> 00:01:13.770
you guys know.

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:16.082
TALIESIN: I'm so excited. I haven't heard yours
yet.

00:01:16.082 --> 00:01:17.238
SAM: Are we on?

00:01:17.238 --> 00:01:18.691
MATT: We are on. Hi. Welcome, Sam.

00:01:18.691 --> 00:01:20.033
SAM: Hi, guys.

00:01:20.033 --> 00:01:22.014
LIAM: You're so early tonight.

00:01:22.014 --> 00:01:23.078
SAM: (breathless) Oh yeah, sorry.

00:01:23.078 --> 00:01:24.437
(laughter)

00:01:24.437 --> 00:01:29.262
MARISHA: We're the beginning of the
announcements. It's great. We were talking about

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:30.524
the playlists.

00:01:30.524 --> 00:01:32.400
SAM: Oh, I've got to finish mine.

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:38.186
MARISHA: Yeah! You're almost done. I will say, for
those who have not gone and checked out any of the

00:01:38.186 --> 00:01:44.708
playlists, we have Vax and Percy up as well.
Definitely go do it, because all that little extra

00:01:44.708 --> 00:01:50.792
content that we put out is always kind of a litmus
test, to see if people are going to be interested

00:01:50.792 --> 00:01:56.869
in it. And if you guys go and actually visit the
webpage at Geek &amp;amp; Sundry, then we get more

00:01:56.869 --> 00:01:59.335
content. So the more you go visit it--

00:01:59.335 --> 00:02:00.557
MATT: Make more stuff for you guys, yeah.

00:02:00.557 --> 00:02:06.217
MARISHA: Yeah, the more that we can show the
people upstairs that people do like our stuff and

00:02:06.217 --> 00:02:10.945
our content, the more you will get. So please go
check it out if you have not yet. It helps.

00:02:10.945 --> 00:02:13.640
TALIESIN: Here, actually, do this with me. Let's
make a double rainbow gif, for later.

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:16.426
(laughter)

00:02:16.426 --> 00:02:18.365
LAURA: That's beautiful.

00:02:18.365 --> 00:02:20.604
MATT: That's on you, CritRoleSource.

00:02:20.604 --> 00:02:21.814
TALIESIN: That's on you, internet.

00:02:21.814 --> 00:02:23.048
MARISHA: You're welcome.

00:02:23.048 --> 00:02:27.278
MATT: Cool. So that's awesome. Next announcement,
for those who haven't had a chance to see it. A

00:02:27.278 --> 00:02:33.320
little over a year ago I Kickstarted a web series
with a bunch of other really talented people. Sean

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:37.917
Becker, who is director of The Guild, directed it.
It's called Muzzled the Musical. Ashly Burch, a

00:02:37.917 --> 00:02:41.863
bunch of great talented people from The Lizzie
Bennet Diaries and a bunch of other web series,

00:02:41.863 --> 00:02:46.922
Juliet Landau is in it. It's a great fun web
series and it went live last week right before

00:02:46.922 --> 00:02:50.921
Halloween. So we have our three-episode arc up on
YouTube. If you like musicals and you like fun

00:02:50.921 --> 00:02:56.834
silly dark, Doctor Horrible-style performances,
then you're going to like this. Check it out, see

00:02:56.834 --> 00:03:05.802
if you like it. Let's see. Oh yeah, tomorrow is
BlizzCon. BlizzCon, for all you crazy guys who are

00:03:05.802 --> 00:03:11.187
going or those who are watching on the digital
online pass. A bunch of us Critters will be

00:03:11.187 --> 00:03:16.609
wandering the halls, doing panels and all kinds of
fun stuff. Like, for me personally, I'll be there

00:03:16.609 --> 00:03:19.422
tomorrow at 4:30. I think, Liam, you are on that
as well?

00:03:19.519 --> 00:03:20.429
LIAM: Yeah, same panel.

00:03:20.429 --> 00:03:24.309
MATT: Yeah, The World of Warcraft Live panel.
We'll be there doing that. And then doing a

00:03:24.309 --> 00:03:27.056
signing afterward. What else you guys got going on
at BlizzCon?

00:03:27.056 --> 00:03:34.840
LIAM: I'm on three, so I think it's two on Friday
and one on Saturday. I tweeted out the times.

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:39.101
Don't remember them now, so just go check my feed
if you want. I'll see you there.

00:03:39.101 --> 00:03:40.548
MATT: Awesome.

00:03:40.548 --> 00:03:45.050
ZAC: I'm going to have to do my job really quick and
jump in on that. And say that tomorrow at 4:30PM

00:03:45.185 --> 00:03:50.941
PST here, we will be doing a live trailer watch
and reveal with special guests. Laura and Travis

00:03:50.941 --> 00:03:56.488
are coming by. Alison Haislip and Ify Nwadiwe are
going to be our hosts for that. And then we are

00:03:56.488 --> 00:04:00.324
going to have interviews with Duncan Jones the
director and some of the cast and crew. It's going

00:04:00.324 --> 00:04:02.972
to be really cool, so tune in tomorrow, 4:30, for
that.

00:04:02.972 --> 00:04:08.667
TALIESIN: And then if you're at BlizzCon, I think
we're going to be wandering around a little bit.

00:04:08.667 --> 00:04:09.717
MARISHA: Yes, I'll be there.

00:04:09.717 --> 00:04:10.874
TALIESIN: Yeah, I'll be there.

00:04:10.874 --> 00:04:13.018
MARISHA: We'll be there. Probably watching his
panels.

00:04:13.018 --> 00:04:22.953
MATT: Rock that out. Cool. Also, tonight is
Critmas. So for those who want to hang around.

00:04:23.056 --> 00:04:27.651
(voice cracking) We have quite a cavalcade of
presents.

00:04:27.806 --> 00:04:29.293
LAURA: There's a lot of presents, you guys.

00:04:29.293 --> 00:04:32.569
LIAM: Taliesin and I got here early and with Ryan
we opened everything and it's an

00:04:32.569 --> 00:04:34.875
embarrassment of riches.

00:04:34.875 --> 00:04:37.857
LAURA: They had to open it so that we wouldn't be
opening the boxes.

00:04:37.956 --> 00:04:39.310
TALIESIN: We tried not to peek.

00:04:39.310 --> 00:04:46.194
LIAM: Some of the stuff I didn't see, some of the
stuff Taliesin didn't see. So we're not completely

00:04:46.194 --> 00:04:47.468
spoiled, we're a little spoiled.

00:04:47.468 --> 00:04:49.646
LAURA: We got a little spoiled. I got a little
spoiled early, though.

00:04:49.646 --> 00:04:51.516
MATT: Because of that.

00:04:51.516 --> 00:04:55.130
LAURA: Somebody sent a new Trinket! Look at that,
you guys!

00:04:55.130 --> 00:04:57.037
MATT: Giant bear.

00:04:57.037 --> 00:04:59.265
LAURA: Look at him. He's so cute.

00:04:59.265 --> 00:05:03.501
LIAM: And please. I mean, we thought it was a
corpse, at first, when we got it. Then, when we

00:05:03.501 --> 00:05:09.789
opened it up we got really excited and I had this,
which I used to open it. We got really excited and

00:05:09.789 --> 00:05:13.120
took a bear out, and then it was a bear and we
forgot about all the wrappings and the paper. So

00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:15.313
if you sent us the bear, please contact us now.

00:05:15.313 --> 00:05:16.782
SAM: Wait, we don't know who sent it?!

00:05:16.782 --> 00:05:23.991
LIAM: Just contact us now. You're watching.
Somebody is watching who knows that person, so

00:05:23.991 --> 00:05:25.290
just let us know.

00:05:25.290 --> 00:05:26.726
MATT: Find them, post it in the chat room.

00:05:26.726 --> 00:05:28.350
TALIESIN: Somewhere they're saying, "That's my
bear".

00:05:28.350 --> 00:05:31.997
LAURA: Please! I have just been hugging it
non-stop.

00:05:31.997 --> 00:05:35.618
MATT: It was pretty amazing when it was wrapped
up. It looked like a body. Like, straight up,

00:05:35.618 --> 00:05:37.930
season two Dexter. It was pretty fantastic.

00:05:37.930 --> 00:05:41.510
MARISHA: Which leads us to our next point. Please
don't send us bodies.

00:05:41.510 --> 00:05:43.659
MATT: Please don't. No bodies.

00:05:43.659 --> 00:05:46.476
TALIESIN: Address it to me, if you do.

00:05:46.476 --> 00:05:48.510
MATT: (laughs) He'll know what to do.

00:05:48.510 --> 00:05:53.208
LIAM: I think if it had been the only package, we
would have been able to focus better, but there

00:05:53.208 --> 00:06:00.499
were about a hundred packages, so it was difficult
for us to focus. We were opening stuff for an hour

00:06:00.499 --> 00:06:02.386
and a half, so thanks in advance.

00:06:02.386 --> 00:06:07.381
MATT: So thanks in advance for that. Also, you
will recognize a couple of new songs tonight. We

00:06:07.381 --> 00:06:13.774
had the wonderful pleasure of having Bethesda
approve us using Elder Scrolls music in our

00:06:13.774 --> 00:06:20.235
on-channel playlists. So I have been able to go
back and re-incorporate all of my old Elder

00:06:20.235 --> 00:06:25.912
Scrolls music that I used when we originally
played off stream. So that's really cool. Thank

00:06:25.912 --> 00:06:27.689
you, Bethesda. Thank you guys very much.

00:06:27.689 --> 00:06:29.742
TALIESIN: Now ten percent more realistic: Critical
Role.

00:06:29.742 --> 00:06:31.961
MATT: Exactly. Imagine that. Really stoked about
that.

00:06:31.961 --> 00:06:33.364
TALIESIN: More authentic. Homebrew.

00:06:33.364 --> 00:06:38.532
MATT: Just a reminder. The "How do you want to do
this?" shirts are up. I still have to get

00:06:38.532 --> 00:06:46.743
one for myself. I think I should. And we have the
Critical Role necklace and awesome keychain, which

00:06:46.847 --> 00:06:48.466
I have not seen in person until tonight.

00:06:48.466 --> 00:06:50.038
LAURA: They're really cool.

00:06:50.038 --> 00:06:57.857
MATT: So we'll pass them around and we can each
give it our blessing. Each individual one is

00:06:57.857 --> 00:07:03.493
blessed by me. That's not true, but you will still
roll well while wearing one. So that's exciting,

00:07:03.594 --> 00:07:10.367
and let's see what else we got. Do you want to do
the quick Wyrmwood thing? Reminder from Wyrmwood?

00:07:10.367 --> 00:07:16.872
LIAM: Yeah. We are friends with Wyrmwood Gaming,
and you can still use the code CritRole to get

00:07:16.872 --> 00:07:21.977
free shipping on an order for your wood. Its
beautiful wood. I have some black wood, but

00:07:21.977 --> 00:07:23.829
there's many different colors.

00:07:23.829 --> 00:07:25.239
LAURA: I got this wood.

00:07:25.239 --> 00:07:30.960
LIAM: They are really, really beautiful. So just
share the nerd connections, everybody.

00:07:30.960 --> 00:07:32.318
MARISHA: Pretty sexy.

00:07:32.318 --> 00:07:35.650
LAURA: These are the Kickstarter boxes, though.
These are what's being done now, or are those for

00:07:35.650 --> 00:07:36.769
sale right now?

00:07:36.769 --> 00:07:42.475
LIAM: The Kickstarter boxes are not. The CritRole
code will not work for these, but they'll work for

00:07:42.475 --> 00:07:44.327
these bad mama-jamas right here.

00:07:44.327 --> 00:07:45.705
SAM: Which is really what you want.

00:07:45.705 --> 00:07:49.665
LAURA: And these, too. These are deck boxes.

00:07:49.665 --> 00:07:57.125
MATT: Yeah. Thank you, Wyrmwood, for being so
awesome and for putting that code together

00:07:57.125 --> 00:07:58.511
for our community.

00:07:58.511 --> 00:08:00.360
LIAM: I have one personal thing.

00:08:00.360 --> 00:08:01.368
MATT: Yes, please.

00:08:01.368 --> 00:08:05.526
LIAM: I have a pilot on Amazon Prime called
Everstar, where I play a little robot.

00:08:05.526 --> 00:08:06.732
SAM: Is that true?!

00:08:06.732 --> 00:08:08.421
LIAM: And he's really uptight. Yeah, that's a
pilot.

00:08:08.421 --> 00:08:09.920
SAM: Oh, did the Amazon pilots launch today?

00:08:09.920 --> 00:08:15.029
LIAM: They all launched, and I'm in a cute
adventure cartoon for young girls and boys. And

00:08:15.029 --> 00:08:21.301
I'm up against bloody, gritty live-action dramas
and political satire and other cartoons, as well.

00:08:21.301 --> 00:08:26.344
Roger Craig Smith is playing Mouse Cookies. But if
you like Everstar, which is this young

00:08:26.344 --> 00:08:30.319
action/adventure space-pirate story, give it a
watch. If you like it, vote it through. If it gets

00:08:30.319 --> 00:08:32.884
voted through, I will continue to be a robot.

00:08:32.884 --> 00:08:38.004
SAM: I directed one, too, called Yoyotoki Happy
Ears. So that's on there too.

00:08:38.004 --> 00:08:39.573
MATT: How's that go, again?

00:08:39.573 --> 00:08:45.969
SAM: Yoyotoki Happy Ears. It's really weird and
funny, and it's actually really awesome.

00:08:46.002 --> 00:08:51.236
TRAVIS: Also, Halo 5 is out this week, which Laura
and I are in. It's amazing.

00:08:51.236 --> 00:08:52.899
LIAM: I'm not familiar with that. What is that?

00:08:52.899 --> 00:08:55.424
TRAVIS: It's some game. Takes place in outer
space.

00:08:55.424 --> 00:08:58.137
LIAM: Is that a match three? Like Bejeweled?

00:08:58.137 --> 00:09:01.520
TRAVIS: It's like Candy Crush, but with more
death.

00:09:01.520 --> 00:09:03.670
TALIESIN: That's available on Android.

00:09:03.670 --> 00:09:09.807
MATT: The last announcement is that they announced
that The Witcher is coming to theaters in a couple

00:09:09.807 --> 00:09:13.016
of years, and that has nothing to do with us,
other than the fact that I'm probably going to be

00:09:13.016 --> 00:09:16.982
at full mast for the next week, thinking of that
possibility.

00:09:16.982 --> 00:09:18.657
TRAVIS: Said so casually.

00:09:18.657 --> 00:09:19.991
LAURA: Yeah.

00:09:19.991 --> 00:09:23.985
MATT: I'm so excited. Please don't fuck it up.

00:09:23.985 --> 00:09:26.532
TRAVIS: They will. It'll be Mark Wahlberg.

00:09:26.532 --> 00:09:28.421
MATT: No, no, no!

00:09:28.421 --> 00:09:32.801
MARISHA: Channing Tatum.

00:09:32.801 --> 00:09:34.048
LIAM: Will Ferrell.

00:09:34.048 --> 00:09:36.045
MATT: I will... I would not!

00:09:36.045 --> 00:09:37.609
MARISHA: Channing Tatum is Geralt of Rivia.

00:09:37.609 --> 00:09:39.443
LAURA: Done! Let's make this happen.

00:09:39.443 --> 00:09:47.988
MATT: Don't. Guys, I will stop this show. Your DM
is out! If Channing Tatum becomes Geralt, I will

00:09:47.988 --> 00:09:56.885
be so furious. He's great at certain roles. I
loved him in... I absolutely adored him in the 21

00:09:56.885 --> 00:09:58.253
Jump Street movies.

00:09:58.253 --> 00:10:04.132
SAM: I guess he's not coming on our show, jeez.

00:10:04.132 --> 00:10:11.260
MATT: That's enough of our silly talk. Let's go
ahead and dive into the chaos that is the current

00:10:11.260 --> 00:10:17.502
circumstance. Keep in mind, the culmination of
leading into Halloween with this story arc and now

00:10:17.502 --> 00:10:21.992
going and starting a rebellion in Whitestone on
the Fifth of November has been a very delightful,

00:10:21.992 --> 00:10:24.844
unintentional coordination here.

00:10:24.844 --> 00:10:29.179
TALIESIN: I almost wore my special spider belt,
too, but it felt too weird.

00:10:29.179 --> 00:10:34.581
MATT: So that's pretty cool. So to get you guys up
to speed with the circumstance that has

00:10:34.581 --> 00:10:40.837
happened, those especially that are tuning in for
the first time. A couple known as the Briarwoods

00:10:40.881 --> 00:10:49.001
that took over the city of Whitestone five years before,
murdering most of the ruling family of Percy--

00:10:49.110 --> 00:10:54.994
other than himself, escaping-- have recently been
doing political discussions with the home city of

00:10:54.994 --> 00:11:02.267
Emon. Vox Machina, our troop of intrepid
adventurers, upon discovering this, battled them

00:11:02.267 --> 00:11:08.609
at Emon. They fled to Whitestone, and the party
has then gone after to seek to destroy them and

00:11:08.609 --> 00:11:10.991
free the town, the once-home to Percival.

00:11:10.991 --> 00:11:16.465
In the process, it appears that there have been a number of
warnings set, and the entire town has been long

00:11:16.497 --> 00:11:24.017
held under this dark, ominous rule that they have
kept at bay. Apparently, they have found notes of

00:11:24.017 --> 00:11:29.842
previous, failed rebellions, and things that die
here don't seem to stay dead. A number of

00:11:29.842 --> 00:11:35.465
zombified giants are wandering the city as these
giant lurching sentinels. And apparently, a number

00:11:35.465 --> 00:11:39.746
of the cutthroats that helped the Briarwoods come
to power in this town have now been given titles

00:11:39.746 --> 00:11:42.966
and land here and are now called the new nobles by
the locals.

00:11:42.966 --> 00:11:50.499
During this process, you guys managed to sneak
into the town, began setting out word of coming

00:11:50.499 --> 00:11:57.120
rebellion and that Percival de Rolo has returned
and the Briarwoods' time is numbered. Upon meeting

00:11:57.120 --> 00:12:03.633
the previous chancellor to your father of the
town, Archibald, you guys came to an

00:12:03.633 --> 00:12:09.519
understanding, and he was going to reach out to
all of his contacts and let them know that the

00:12:09.519 --> 00:12:13.972
rebellion is happening. You guys then set out to
set a two-pronged attack against two of the

00:12:14.013 --> 00:12:21.374
remaining new nobles in the town. Most of the
party going to seek the outside of Count-- what's

00:12:21.374 --> 00:12:22.587
his name?

00:12:22.587 --> 00:12:23.880
TRAVIS and LAURA: Count Dooku.

00:12:23.880 --> 00:12:27.084
MARISHA: Count Duke.

00:12:27.084 --> 00:12:33.487
MATT: Duke Vedmeyer was the one that Scanlan went
to, and then Tylieri is the one that the rest of

00:12:33.487 --> 00:12:41.085
you wandered outside. Now, as the rain pours down
into the city, midday. Scanlan decided to open

00:12:41.085 --> 00:12:51.252
from a Polymorph spell, as a fly, to the top of
the front doorstep of Vedmeyer's home. Then,

00:12:51.252 --> 00:12:57.494
proceeding to un-Polymorph and re-Polymorph into a
triceratops. Of which, I have your statistics here

00:12:57.494 --> 00:12:59.721
for your triceratops form, if you want to come get
that.

00:12:59.721 --> 00:13:02.261
MARISHA: Go get them stats, boy!

00:13:02.261 --> 00:13:06.425
TALIESIN AND MARISHA: (chanting) Stats, stats,
stats!

00:13:06.425 --> 00:13:16.459
MATT: So that's your triceratops form. After
becoming a triceratops, you squashed the front

00:13:16.459 --> 00:13:19.877
guard that was there, you slammed through the
front of the building, destroying the front door,

00:13:19.877 --> 00:13:26.804
and we cut to the other group who is stealthing
through the rain. At which point, the okay was

00:13:26.804 --> 00:13:32.465
given to Grog, whether intentionally or not. Grog
then charged to the front door of Tylieri's

00:13:32.465 --> 00:13:36.906
estate, and the rest of you prepared for impact.
And that was where we left off, in the center of

00:13:36.906 --> 00:13:38.014
this chaos.

00:13:38.014 --> 00:13:39.706
LIAM: Let's do this!

00:13:39.706 --> 00:13:41.858
LAURA: Oh, god.

00:13:41.961 --> 00:13:45.201
MATT: So without further ado. Sam.

00:13:45.201 --> 00:13:50.282
SAM: But I was just handed this.

00:13:50.282 --> 00:13:51.956
MATT: I know, take a look.

00:13:51.956 --> 00:13:53.769
TRAVIS: Sucks to be first!

00:13:53.769 --> 00:13:58.075
LIAM: He's got the maps out already. Get your shit
together, man.

00:13:58.075 --> 00:14:00.477
SAM: I've never been a triceratops before.

00:14:00.477 --> 00:14:01.983
LIAM: That's not what I heard.

00:14:01.983 --> 00:14:12.475
SAM: All right, you're right. Think like a triceratops.
So, I need shelter. I don't know. How do

00:14:12.578 --> 00:14:15.375
triceratopses think?

00:14:15.375 --> 00:14:19.188
TALIESIN: Probably like punk rock hippopotamuses.

00:14:19.188 --> 00:14:21.512
SAM: Hip-hop-ipotimi.

00:14:21.512 --> 00:14:30.350
MATT: Say, for the sake of this, for now, we'll go
through your circumstance, as they are separate.

00:14:30.350 --> 00:14:38.330
So Scanlan, you are-- I did not have a
triceratops, but I did have a stegosaurus. It's

00:14:38.330 --> 00:14:41.501
the same size. I'm sorry, bloodspike behemoth.

00:14:41.501 --> 00:14:43.079
TALIESIN: That's kind of racist.

00:14:43.079 --> 00:14:46.213
MATT: I'm sorry. You know what? They're not around
to argue.

00:14:46.213 --> 00:14:49.995
TRAVIS: That you know of.

00:14:50.039 --> 00:14:54.954
TALIESIN: We are going to get a bunch of angry
tweets from stegosauruses and triceratops.

00:14:54.954 --> 00:15:01.213
MATT: I'm sure. Please, bring them my way. As you
slam your way into the front of Duke Vedmeyer's

00:15:01.213 --> 00:15:06.380
estate. Pieces of wood blasting outward,
scattering among the center of the foyer. You see

00:15:06.380 --> 00:15:10.126
before you a rising staircase that divides into
two separate staircases that curl around to the

00:15:10.126 --> 00:15:11.355
second level.

00:15:11.479 --> 00:15:13.431
SAM: Lovely decor.

00:15:13.431 --> 00:15:23.948
MATT: You also notice that the entire
interior is currently filled with guards. All

00:15:23.948 --> 00:15:31.706
seemingly prepared and almost expecting your
arrival.

00:15:31.706 --> 00:15:36.222
SAM: I think I can take them, guys. I think I can
take them.

00:15:36.222 --> 00:15:43.187
MATT: You also see, at the top, Duke Vedmeyer
himself. A large, hairless, grey-skinned goliath,

00:15:43.187 --> 00:15:46.979
wielding a giant two-handed sword, armored with a
breastplate.

00:15:46.979 --> 00:15:48.679
MARISHA: Vecmeyer?

00:15:48.679 --> 00:15:49.724
MATT: Vedmeyer.

00:15:49.724 --> 00:15:50.798
LAURA: He's a goliath?

00:15:50.798 --> 00:15:51.992
MATT: He's a goliath, yeah.

00:15:51.992 --> 00:15:53.236
MARISHA: Vedmeyer is a goliath?

00:15:53.236 --> 00:16:00.772
SAM: Wow, that's going to be fun later, but not
right now. Okay, do I know? So, let's assess my

00:16:00.772 --> 00:16:07.133
knowledge real quick. I know about him a little
bit. He is one of the thugs that came into the city.

00:16:07.133 --> 00:16:08.120
MATT: Correct.

00:16:08.120 --> 00:16:11.447
SAM: He is not a magic-wielder, as far as I know.

00:16:11.447 --> 00:16:16.012
MATT: As far as you know, no. And at first glance,
based on the fact that he is wearing heavy

00:16:16.012 --> 00:16:19.672
breastplate and is wielding a giant two-handed
sword, you get the feeling he is probably not as

00:16:19.672 --> 00:16:22.706
heavily inclined towards the arcane arts as others
you have encountered.

00:16:22.706 --> 00:16:31.473
SAM: As I quickly survey the room, do I see anyone
else who is a threat greater than a heavily armed

00:16:31.473 --> 00:16:36.472
guard? Anything that is a creepy wizard or a weird
old mage?

00:16:36.504 --> 00:16:41.510
MATT: Currently, no. Currently, all you see are a
series of Whitestone guards in uniform armor, all

00:16:41.510 --> 00:16:46.218
with heavy crossbows, currently nocked. And as you
come blasting through the door, they are already

00:16:46.218 --> 00:16:51.427
arranged in what appears to be a waiting pattern,
should anything try and charge its way into the house.

00:16:51.427 --> 00:16:53.341
SAM: So they'll probably all shoot me, won't
they?

00:16:53.341 --> 00:16:54.952
MATT: In fact, roll initiative.

00:16:54.952 --> 00:16:58.261
SAM: So directly in front of me, there's a
staircase going up?

00:16:58.261 --> 00:16:59.180
MATT: Yep.

00:16:59.180 --> 00:17:00.617
SAM: Any other doors or exits?

00:17:00.617 --> 00:17:04.486
MATT: There are doors on each side that are
currently locked, and other than that, no.

00:17:04.519 --> 00:17:06.142
SAM: Those are locked doors?

00:17:06.142 --> 00:17:10.739
MATT: They are closed currently, and they appear
to be-- There's a giant wooden beam crossed over

00:17:10.739 --> 00:17:14.221
the front of each. Then there's the outside which
leads to the exterior, to the raining outside of

00:17:14.321 --> 00:17:16.346
the household, and the stairs that go up.

00:17:16.346 --> 00:17:17.444
SAM: Oh, man.

00:17:17.444 --> 00:17:18.370
MATT: Roll initiative.

00:17:18.370 --> 00:17:22.062
SAM: Initiative? Don't I get a surprise round?
Doesn't matter. 21.

00:17:22.062 --> 00:17:24.600
MATT: Okay.

00:17:24.600 --> 00:17:28.859
SAM: I don't get a surprise round because I sprung
in there?

00:17:28.859 --> 00:17:30.033
MATT: Apparently not.

00:17:30.033 --> 00:17:31.174
SAM: Damn it.

00:17:31.174 --> 00:17:34.259
MATT: You made a very loud noise when you turned
into a triceratops and tore through the front of

00:17:34.259 --> 00:17:39.485
the household. All right, so Scanlan is up first.

00:17:39.485 --> 00:17:46.417
SAM: So here's the thing. Here's the thing. I
should probably leave.

00:17:46.417 --> 00:17:47.406
TRAVIS: Yeah, come on.

00:17:47.406 --> 00:17:50.944
SAM: But come on. I'm a triceratops! I've got to
have some fun first, right?

00:17:50.944 --> 00:17:52.849
TRAVIS: You can take a couple of hit points,
right?

00:17:52.849 --> 00:17:54.218
SAM: Right?!

00:17:54.218 --> 00:17:55.705
TALIESIN: I think you revert back to normal.

00:17:55.705 --> 00:17:57.985
MARISHA: Does Polymorph carry over?

00:17:57.985 --> 00:18:03.031
MATT: If you go to zero hit points in animal form,
you go back to your regular full health and any

00:18:03.031 --> 00:18:05.320
damage that carries over just goes to your regular
health, at that point.

00:18:05.320 --> 00:18:06.531
LAURA: That's a lot of people.

00:18:06.531 --> 00:18:07.955
MARISHA: You have 115 hit points.

00:18:07.955 --> 00:18:09.309
MATT: You guys aren't there. Scanlan, what are you
doing?

00:18:09.309 --> 00:18:12.142
TRAVIS: (sings Jurassic Park theme)

00:18:12.142 --> 00:18:17.406
(others join in)

00:18:17.524 --> 00:18:19.144
MATT: What are you doing?

00:18:19.144 --> 00:18:20.344
SAM: Wait, it's my turn first?

00:18:20.344 --> 00:18:21.531
MATT: Yeah, you have initiative, man.

00:18:21.531 --> 00:18:22.881
SAM: I beat them with initiative?

00:18:22.881 --> 00:18:23.839
MATT: You did.

00:18:23.839 --> 00:18:26.948
SAM: They are more than my charging distance as a
triceratops, right?

00:18:26.948 --> 00:18:29.289
MATT: He's the only one that's within,
technically. What's your speed?

00:18:29.289 --> 00:18:30.449
SAM: 40.

00:18:30.449 --> 00:18:34.389
MATT: 40. You would get right up to Vedmeyer if
you were to charge.

00:18:34.389 --> 00:18:35.835
SAM: I would be dead.

00:18:35.835 --> 00:18:37.936
TRAVIS: No, you wouldn't. You got it. Go stick
him!

00:18:37.936 --> 00:18:39.587
MATT: What do you want to do?

00:18:39.587 --> 00:18:46.595
SAM: I'm going to go-- How far away are the doors
on the sides?

00:18:46.595 --> 00:18:49.267
MATT: Over here? It's about 35 feet.

00:18:49.267 --> 00:18:52.468
SAM: I'm going to turn right and blast through
that door.

00:18:52.468 --> 00:18:55.014
(laughter)

00:18:55.014 --> 00:18:58.306
MATT: Okay!

00:18:58.306 --> 00:19:06.051
SAM: Oh shit, it could be trapped. Well, we'll
find out.

00:19:06.051 --> 00:19:10.174
LIAM: Expect the unexpected with Scanlan
Shorthalt.

00:19:10.174 --> 00:19:13.126
MATT: He goes blasting through the doors.

00:19:13.126 --> 00:19:15.228
SAM: Do I have to roll to blast through the
doors?

00:19:15.228 --> 00:19:18.678
MATT: We are going to find out. Yeah, go ahead and
roll a strength check. Roll a d20 and add your

00:19:18.733 --> 00:19:20.845
strength modifier of the triceratops form.

00:19:20.845 --> 00:19:24.340
SAM: Okay, strength modifier says plus five. So
that's only a 17.

00:19:24.340 --> 00:19:27.238
LAURA: For a door!

00:19:27.238 --> 00:19:30.625
SAM: Me and doors don't get along too well.

00:19:30.625 --> 00:19:36.412
MATT: You, running, slam your head in,
through, the horns protruding and tearing through

00:19:36.412 --> 00:19:39.582
the wood. The doors break inward, but the doors
don't fully blast inward.

00:19:39.615 --> 00:19:41.403
SAM: The door beat me!

00:19:41.403 --> 00:19:46.848
MATT: The door is in bad shape. It won't take much
more power to blast through.

00:19:46.848 --> 00:19:48.350
SAM: These fucking doors.

00:19:48.350 --> 00:19:50.951
MATT: It's now your worst nemesis.

00:19:50.951 --> 00:19:53.449
SAM: So now I am stuck in a door?

00:19:53.449 --> 00:19:58.915
MATT: You could try and pull back out. You manage
to pull out without an issue. The doors are mostly

00:19:58.915 --> 00:20:02.509
beaten inward. It will take but a small impact to
blast through next turn, if you wanted to.

00:20:02.509 --> 00:20:06.186
SAM: Next turn? Do I still have an action after
this?

00:20:06.186 --> 00:20:08.126
MATT: That would have been your action.

00:20:08.126 --> 00:20:12.381
TRAVIS: You're great! You're money. You're good.

00:20:12.381 --> 00:20:14.602
LAURA: Every single one of those guys can attack
you now.

00:20:14.602 --> 00:20:16.375
SAM: Yeah, but it probably won't happen.

00:20:16.375 --> 00:20:17.935
TRAVIS: Maybe they didn't see you.

00:20:17.935 --> 00:20:19.132
LAURA: Run away.

00:20:19.132 --> 00:20:23.566
SAM: It's not my turn anymore, right? That's it.

00:20:23.607 --> 00:20:24.778
MATT: That's your turn.

00:20:24.778 --> 00:20:25.680
LAURA: No!

00:20:25.680 --> 00:20:27.379
SAM: My triceratops ass is sticking out.

00:20:27.379 --> 00:20:28.523
MATT: Just right there.

00:20:28.523 --> 00:20:30.751
TRAVIS: Look, they're all dummies. They're just
mannequins.

00:20:30.751 --> 00:20:36.574
MATT: This guy moves up over the railing with his
heavy crossbow and aims this way. These guys all

00:20:36.574 --> 00:20:38.624
shift to this side with their crossbows.

00:20:38.624 --> 00:20:41.464
SAM: I'm going to die.

00:20:41.464 --> 00:20:46.733
MATT: Over here, this guy's going to move to this
point so he can get a view of you. And Vedmeyer is

00:20:46.733 --> 00:20:52.964
going to move down here and get his sword ready,
grinning. As he holds his sword up, he puts his

00:20:53.105 --> 00:21:00.896
hand up and goes, "Aim, fire!" A bunch of crossbow
bolts get loosed at once (shh, shh) through the

00:21:00.896 --> 00:21:03.720
middle of the room. What's your armor class as the
triceratops?

00:21:03.720 --> 00:21:06.128
SAM: I have no idea. 14?!

00:21:06.128 --> 00:21:15.709
MATT: 11, that misses. That's a 13, misses.

00:21:15.709 --> 00:21:17.509
SAM: Wow, these guys suck.

00:21:17.509 --> 00:21:19.148
TALIESIN: They are like stormtroopers.

00:21:19.148 --> 00:21:20.756
MATT: Natural one.

00:21:20.756 --> 00:21:23.469
TALIESIN: They are! You are being attacked by
stormtroopers.

00:21:23.469 --> 00:21:37.105
MATT: That's going to be a 14, hits. 18, hits. 24,
hits. That was six?

00:21:37.105 --> 00:21:38.780
SAM: That was six.

00:21:38.780 --> 00:21:39.936
TRAVIS: Three hits.

00:21:39.936 --> 00:21:43.888
MATT: One more, that's a 22. So I have four that
actually hit you with the crossbow bolts.

00:21:43.888 --> 00:21:45.459
TALIESIN: You're fine.

00:21:45.459 --> 00:21:46.550
SAM: Yeah.

00:21:46.550 --> 00:21:48.641
TRAVIS: You're now a porcupine triceratops.

00:21:48.641 --> 00:21:50.479
LAURA: You have 115 hit points.

00:21:50.479 --> 00:21:53.069
SAM: I have 115 hit points?!

00:21:53.069 --> 00:21:55.793
TALIESIN: And when those go out, you are back to
human hit points.

00:21:55.793 --> 00:22:03.520
MATT: That's eight piercing damage. 13 piercing
damage. 21.

00:22:03.520 --> 00:22:06.148
LAURA: Are you immune to any kind of damage?

00:22:06.148 --> 00:22:12.209
MATT: 25. 34 points of piercing damage from this 
volley.

00:22:12.251 --> 00:22:14.675
LIAM: Is there resistance to anything on there?

00:22:14.675 --> 00:22:15.781
MATT: Nope.

00:22:15.781 --> 00:22:24.094
SAM: What does that take me down to? 81? Is that
right? 115 minus 34, 81?

00:22:24.094 --> 00:22:25.835
TALIESIN: Sounds about right.

00:22:25.835 --> 00:22:27.508
SAM: Okay.

00:22:27.508 --> 00:22:30.564
MATT: All right. That brings us back to the top of
the initiative round, and you're up.

00:22:30.564 --> 00:22:33.720
SAM: Well, shit, then I've got to get some
retribution.

00:22:33.720 --> 00:22:36.561
TRAVIS: Totally. Turn around and give it to them.

00:22:36.561 --> 00:22:39.612
SAM: Am I considered flanked?

00:22:39.612 --> 00:22:40.854
MATT: You are not.

00:22:40.854 --> 00:22:41.891
SAM: Damn it.

00:22:41.891 --> 00:22:44.533
TRAVIS: You do have a tail.

00:22:44.533 --> 00:22:46.505
SAM: I do have a tail.

00:22:46.505 --> 00:22:48.509
MARISHA: You are like a drunk guy at a craps
table.

00:22:48.509 --> 00:22:50.841
SAM: I don't know how to hit things. I've never
hit things before.

00:22:50.841 --> 00:22:52.724
LIAM: There's the door you mangled in front of
you.

00:22:52.724 --> 00:22:56.255
SAM: Okay, I'm going to gore that guy to my left.

00:22:56.255 --> 00:22:58.521
MATT: He is above you on the railing.

00:22:58.521 --> 00:23:01.991
SAM: Oh, that's a balcony. I thought that was a
stairway down.

00:23:01.991 --> 00:23:05.199
MATT: I'm sorry, this is a balcony up
top. So he's actually aiming down and firing at you.

00:23:05.332 --> 00:23:07.627
LAURA: Then just go through the door.

00:23:07.627 --> 00:23:08.964
SAM: I'm going through the door.

00:23:08.964 --> 00:23:12.156
MATT: All right, then roll another strength
check.

00:23:12.156 --> 00:23:16.656
SAM: Yeah, because I'm not tangling with Duke
Vedmeyer or whatever. 23.

00:23:16.656 --> 00:23:21.146
MATT: 23, not a problem. You burst through.

00:23:21.146 --> 00:23:24.282
TALIESIN: We're going off the map.

00:23:24.282 --> 00:23:26.541
LIAM: Hey, you guys!

00:23:26.541 --> 00:23:30.130
MARISHA: He's taking them off the grid.

00:23:30.130 --> 00:23:34.064
TALIESIN AND MARISHA: He doesn't have a social
security number!

00:23:34.064 --> 00:23:38.515
MATT: So what you see in here, as you blast
through. It's a dining room with a central dining

00:23:38.515 --> 00:23:45.871
room table, two small tables in the far corners.
There is a ten-foot window across the way. It

00:23:45.871 --> 00:23:48.014
appears to be a normal dining room set.

00:23:48.014 --> 00:23:49.596
SAM: Is that my action?

00:23:49.596 --> 00:23:50.772
MATT: That is your movement.

00:23:50.772 --> 00:23:51.913
SAM: That's my movement?

00:23:51.913 --> 00:23:55.409
MATT: Yeah, I'd say at this point it is so damaged
that it doesn't take much effort to push through,

00:23:55.409 --> 00:23:57.373
so you can manage to push through as part of your
movement.

00:23:57.373 --> 00:23:58.618
SAM: Okay.

00:23:58.618 --> 00:24:04.359
TALIESIN: You could pick 'em off as they run
through. I'm not helping. I'm sorry.

00:24:04.359 --> 00:24:05.934
MATT: Nope, you guys aren't there.

00:24:06.098 --> 00:24:07.499
TALIESIN: Not there. Shutting up.

00:24:07.499 --> 00:24:10.301
SAM: (whispers) I should get out of there. But
it's so fun.

00:24:10.301 --> 00:24:11.803
MATT: What do you want to do, Scanlan?

00:24:11.803 --> 00:24:13.891
SAM: So, I am in the room. No one is in there with
me.

00:24:13.891 --> 00:24:14.885
MATT: Correct.

00:24:14.885 --> 00:24:18.730
SAM: So where's this laser pointer?

00:24:18.730 --> 00:24:24.623
TALIESIN: You can also hold your action. Just as
an option. Not to help, but you can hold your action.

00:24:24.623 --> 00:24:36.858
SAM: So, yeah. I'll just position myself right
next to the the door there, and I will hold my

00:24:36.858 --> 00:24:40.687
attack until anyone runs through the door. They
get an insta-gore.

00:24:40.687 --> 00:24:50.889
MATT: Okay, good to know. Holding an action. The
next turn will be Vedmeyer.

00:24:50.889 --> 00:24:54.366
SAM: Oh shit, here he comes. Here he comes. It's
me and the big guy.

00:24:54.366 --> 00:25:00.393
MATT: Holds up there. He is going to wait there.
He's actually going to dash and just get up right

00:25:00.393 --> 00:25:04.796
next to where the doors are burst open. He can
hear you right around the corner. The rest of

00:25:04.903 --> 00:25:07.065
these guys are going to dash in.

00:25:07.065 --> 00:25:13.279
SAM: Oh god. I think I can take them, guys.

00:25:13.383 --> 00:25:19.271
MATT: There, there, there. This guy is going to
just try and jump down. Let's see if he makes his

00:25:19.322 --> 00:25:27.860
acrobatics. He does not, with his armor. He leaps
off the edge and manages to damage his ankle and

00:25:27.860 --> 00:25:35.730
is currently prone on the ground. That ends their
turn. Back at the top. Are you still holding your

00:25:35.730 --> 00:25:37.560
action on your turn now? It's back to you.

00:25:37.560 --> 00:25:40.126
SAM: Okay. Tell me this, did I hear a bunch of
footsteps? Can I hear?

00:25:40.126 --> 00:25:42.516
MATT: You heard a bunch of footsteps coming in,
yeah.

00:25:42.516 --> 00:25:55.383
SAM: (sighs) All right, I'm not good at fighting.
I will--

00:25:55.383 --> 00:25:57.081
LAURA: Can you set a blaze?

00:25:57.081 --> 00:26:04.589
SAM: I don't have any fire. I don't know why I was
sent into this mission. I don't do fire things. I

00:26:04.696 --> 00:26:07.129
will drop my form. Is that an action?

00:26:07.129 --> 00:26:08.490
LAURA: You have a lantern!

00:26:08.490 --> 00:26:09.953
MATT: You can drop it in a moment.

00:26:09.953 --> 00:26:11.384
MARISHA: Don't you have a torch?

00:26:11.384 --> 00:26:16.836
MATT: The triceratops shrinks down to gnomish form
now, in this partially destroyed dining room area.

00:26:16.836 --> 00:26:18.927
What are you doing?

00:26:19.030 --> 00:26:21.933
SAM: I'm going to-- hold on.

00:26:21.933 --> 00:26:24.197
MARISHA: How did this plan happen, then?

00:26:24.197 --> 00:26:26.564
TRAVIS: Because we're a bunch of slap-dicks,
that's why!

00:26:26.564 --> 00:26:31.963
MARISHA: Why didn't you say I don't have fire?! I
said, "Hey Scanlan, I should come with you," and

00:26:31.963 --> 00:26:37.663
you said, "I can take care of myself. How many
times do I have to tell you guys? I don't need

00:26:37.663 --> 00:26:38.847
"your help."

00:26:38.847 --> 00:26:41.957
MATT: The echoing voice you hear, in the back of
your mind, as you imagine this is what Keyleth

00:26:41.957 --> 00:26:44.071
would be saying right now.

00:26:44.071 --> 00:26:52.090
MARISHA: Dorito's a failure, you guys.

00:26:52.236 --> 00:27:02.491
SAM: Yeah, okay. I peek around the corner a little
bit. Just make sure they're all there, and I will

00:27:02.491 --> 00:27:04.532
Stinking Cloud all of them.

00:27:04.532 --> 00:27:06.026
MATT: Okay!

00:27:06.026 --> 00:27:09.723
LIAM: Why are you not Dimension Door-ing out of
there?

00:27:09.723 --> 00:27:14.994
SAM: I've got to have some fun first. How often am
I going to take on a whole house by myself?

00:27:14.994 --> 00:27:17.339
TRAVIS: I like it. I'm so in love with you right
now.

00:27:17.339 --> 00:27:19.002
TALIESIN: I approve of this plan.

00:27:19.002 --> 00:27:28.948
MATT: All right. 20-foot radius sphere. I'd say
you could affect all of them, yeah. All of them in

00:27:28.948 --> 00:27:37.712
this big ol' Stinking Cloud radius. Not a worry.
This whole area fills up with gas. All right. All

00:27:37.786 --> 00:27:43.424
of a sudden, the entire foyer just fills up with
this greenish, noxious cloud of poisonous gas.

00:27:43.424 --> 00:27:47.265
Let's see. They have to make a constitution save.

00:27:47.265 --> 00:27:50.223
LIAM: Get the goliath. Get that goliath.

00:27:50.223 --> 00:27:53.352
MATT: What's the DC? Is this through your hand
cone?

00:27:53.352 --> 00:27:55.633
SAM: Oh, for sure it is. So 19.

00:27:55.633 --> 00:28:11.760
MATT: (laughing) 19? Jesus Christ. Okay. Nope.
Nope. Nope. Nope. Natural 20, he's fine. 19, he's

00:28:11.760 --> 00:28:22.593
fine. 18, nope. Nope. Double nope, because he's on
the ground. Fuck that guy. Vedmeyer rolls a one.

00:28:22.593 --> 00:28:25.326
(cheering)

00:28:25.326 --> 00:28:35.375
MATT: All right, so these two guys immediately
cover their mouths and pull up this little bit of

00:28:35.375 --> 00:28:38.467
material they have around their chest plate armor
to cover their mouth. The rest of them start

00:28:38.467 --> 00:28:43.324
(coughs) hacking up. One of them starts vomiting
all over the ground, and he has a helmet on, so it's

00:28:43.324 --> 00:28:45.516
straining through. It's awful.

00:28:45.639 --> 00:28:46.951
(groaning)

00:28:46.951 --> 00:28:51.662
MATT: Vedmeyer himself kind of backs against the
wall and (groans) just tries to get it to leave

00:28:51.662 --> 00:28:57.467
the area, but it's just this thick cloud.
It's slowly moving away. Yeah, they are in a bad

00:28:57.503 --> 00:29:03.970
place right now. Okay, and you still have
movement. You have only moved five feet so far.

00:29:03.970 --> 00:29:06.006
TRAVIS: Is Stinking Cloud methane-based?

00:29:06.006 --> 00:29:11.152
SAM: (laughs) It is the way I do it. I can still
move?

00:29:11.152 --> 00:29:13.867
MATT: Yeah, you only moved five feet so far, so
you still have 20 feet of movement.

00:29:13.867 --> 00:29:16.697
SAM: Okay, I'll do a Dukes of Hazzard over the
table.

00:29:16.697 --> 00:29:17.891
MATT: All right.

00:29:17.891 --> 00:29:20.221
TRAVIS: Unnecessarily.

00:29:20.221 --> 00:29:24.511
SAM: Do I have to make an athletics check or
anything for that?

00:29:24.511 --> 00:29:26.829
MATT: Do an acrobatics to see how cool it was.

00:29:26.829 --> 00:29:28.306
MARISHA: See how cool it was!

00:29:28.306 --> 00:29:30.121
SAM: Acrobatics?

00:29:30.121 --> 00:29:31.103
MATT: Yes.

00:29:31.103 --> 00:29:32.711
SAM: What do I do for that?

00:29:32.711 --> 00:29:33.861
LIAM: You got a number.

00:29:33.861 --> 00:29:36.070
SAM: I know, but I don't do these things. 11.

00:29:36.070 --> 00:29:43.091
MATT: 11. You (grunts) you slide, only because you
partially destroyed it as a triceratops, (ssss)

00:29:43.091 --> 00:29:46.925
but in your head it looked pretty cool. Thank god
none of your allies were around to actually

00:29:46.925 --> 00:29:49.051
witness it, but you heard the theme music.

00:29:49.051 --> 00:29:51.561
SAM: Okay, yes. So I'm near the window now,
right?

00:29:51.561 --> 00:29:52.880
MATT: Yeah, you're right by the window.

00:29:52.880 --> 00:29:54.606
SAM: Okay, and that's, I guess, everything.
Right?

00:29:54.606 --> 00:29:55.471
MATT: Yeah.

00:29:55.471 --> 00:29:56.232
SAM: Okay.

00:29:56.232 --> 00:30:03.172
MATT: Okay. Your turn ends. Vedmeyer is just-- you
can see his eyes are filling up with liquid. He

00:30:03.172 --> 00:30:11.155
does make his saving throw. He coughs. (coughs)
Manages to clear the air around him. You can see

00:30:11.205 --> 00:30:16.139
the cloud slowly moving back this way, away from
where it was cast. That finishes his turn.

00:30:16.247 --> 00:30:20.389
However, he is no longer affected by the Stinking
Cloud. You can see as the cloud slowly moves past

00:30:20.389 --> 00:30:25.512
him, and his face comes through, his pupil-less,
angry goliath eyes are staring at you from across

00:30:25.512 --> 00:30:31.988
the room to where the doors are open. You see him
grit his teeth and (growls). You can hear his

00:30:31.988 --> 00:30:37.055
teeth scratching across themselves in anger and
fury.

00:30:37.055 --> 00:30:38.753
SAM: I'm shaking.

00:30:38.753 --> 00:30:47.084
MATT: The rest of them are going to go. These two
guys are going to move forward. They both come

00:30:47.084 --> 00:30:51.832
running in, putting another bolt into their
crossbows, (clicking) pulling it back real fast,

00:30:51.832 --> 00:30:56.481
pulling up their heavy crossbows, and firing at
you. That is going to be a 24.

00:30:56.481 --> 00:30:58.410
SAM: Well, that hits. Of course it does.

00:30:58.410 --> 00:30:59.914
MATT: And an 18.

00:30:59.914 --> 00:31:01.713
SAM: Against what?

00:31:01.713 --> 00:31:03.001
LAURA: Your AC!

00:31:03.001 --> 00:31:04.256
SAM: Oh yeah, that hits.

00:31:04.256 --> 00:31:11.875
MATT: So you take 12 points of piercing damage
from the first bolt and five points of piercing

00:31:11.875 --> 00:31:17.280
damage from the second. As both (zoomf, zoomf)
bolts, one hits you in the shoulder and ricochets

00:31:17.280 --> 00:31:21.182
off, not doing much damage. The other one slams
and actually embeds itself into your thigh, about

00:31:21.182 --> 00:31:25.112
an inch into it. It's piercing and
sticking out the other side. Mostly caught armor,

00:31:25.112 --> 00:31:27.693
but you can feel it definitely got a chunk of
flesh in the process.

00:31:27.693 --> 00:31:28.850
LAURA: Oh no.

00:31:28.850 --> 00:31:29.891
SAM: Okay.

00:31:29.891 --> 00:31:31.949
MATT: That ends their turn. The rest of these
guys, now, are going to try and make their saving

00:31:31.949 --> 00:31:41.903
throw. Fail. Fail. Fail. No, success on him,
actually. He rolled a 19. A success on a natural

00:31:41.903 --> 00:31:49.148
19. Fail. Fail. Well, no, actually these three
succeed. The rest of them are still down. So I'll

00:31:49.148 --> 00:31:58.751
say that these guys here are all down. And he's
still up. These two are still down. Okay. That

00:31:58.751 --> 00:32:00.496
ends their turn, you're up.

00:32:00.496 --> 00:32:03.682
SAM: I so want to get some payback, but I
shouldn't, right?

00:32:03.682 --> 00:32:05.493
LIAM: G-T-F-O!

00:32:05.493 --> 00:32:07.749
SAM: I think I can take these guys.

00:32:07.749 --> 00:32:12.428
MATT: That is a hell of a Lightning Bolt line,
right there.

00:32:12.428 --> 00:32:14.075
SAM: How big is that diameter?

00:32:14.075 --> 00:32:18.448
MATT: It's about six feet across.

00:32:18.448 --> 00:32:19.982
SAM: Oh, I can't lift that thing.

00:32:19.982 --> 00:32:28.250
MATT: No, it's a big, long table. You have a very
wide line of individuals, right there. All ready

00:32:28.250 --> 00:32:29.595
to snatch you.

00:32:29.595 --> 00:32:32.798
SAM: All right, one more round. What do you say,
guys?

00:32:32.798 --> 00:32:34.305
TRAVIS and LIAM: We're not here.

00:32:34.305 --> 00:32:44.150
SAM: One more round. I am going to-- fuck. Do I
have line-of-sight on the door?

00:32:44.250 --> 00:32:48.460
MATT: The door is right here. So you're by the
window. So if you wanted to move over here, then

00:32:48.460 --> 00:32:51.085
you would have line of sight on pretty much
everybody.

00:32:51.085 --> 00:32:52.673
SAM: Yeah, that would be so fun.

00:32:52.673 --> 00:32:57.315
TALIESIN: You could move and then move back. I'm
only helping with gameplay strategy.

00:32:57.315 --> 00:32:58.987
SAM: He could brain me.

00:32:58.987 --> 00:32:59.879
TRAVIS: He could.

00:32:59.879 --> 00:33:06.450
SAM: He could brain me in one shot. Okay. I will
duck under the table so they think that's where I

00:33:06.450 --> 00:33:09.509
went, and then Dimension Door to the roof.

00:33:09.509 --> 00:33:16.294
MATT: Okay! You duck under the table. I'm going to
say make a deception roll to try and successfully

00:33:16.294 --> 00:33:17.794
feint them.

00:33:17.794 --> 00:33:19.925
SAM: Oh, okay.

00:33:19.925 --> 00:33:22.578
LIAM: Can they see the top of his head behind the
table?

00:33:22.682 --> 00:33:25.609
MATT: From their direction it's kind of hard.
Especially because there's a table and chairs up

00:33:25.609 --> 00:33:30.141
against it, and part of it has been crushed by a
triceratops that was previously here.

00:33:30.141 --> 00:33:31.862
LIAM: "Oh, I'm going under the table."

00:33:31.967 --> 00:33:33.647
TALIESIN: Sentences you never expect to hear in
your D&amp;amp;D game.

00:33:33.647 --> 00:33:35.061
SAM: 31.

00:33:35.061 --> 00:33:40.567
MATT: So you grab your head. Oh no! Do a very
elaborate dive under the table.

00:33:40.567 --> 00:33:42.714
SAM: Here I go under the table!

00:33:42.800 --> 00:33:46.519
MATT: A little strange dull thud of arcane energy
as you bamf up to the ceiling.

00:33:46.519 --> 00:33:48.257
SAM: Okay, great.

00:33:48.257 --> 00:33:52.710
TALIESIN: He is reaching under the table, ladies
and gentlemen.

00:33:52.710 --> 00:33:55.262
LAURA: I know, what does this mean? Oh, okay.

00:33:55.262 --> 00:34:03.414
MATT: All right, is that your turn? You are now up
on the rooftop. There's rain pouring down. You

00:34:03.514 --> 00:34:07.130
are immediately soaked from the heavy storm that's
now coming into Whitestone.

00:34:07.130 --> 00:34:11.710
SAM: Yeah. It's just me up here?

00:34:11.710 --> 00:34:13.263
MATT: Just you up there, yeah.

00:34:13.263 --> 00:34:16.813
SAM: Okay. I will go invisible and just hang and
just see what happens.

00:34:16.813 --> 00:34:19.981
MATT: Okay. Easy enough to do, because it will
take a round for anyone to recover from that,

00:34:19.981 --> 00:34:22.908
anyway, because you have to use your action both
turns. So as you are waiting up there, you cast

00:34:22.908 --> 00:34:25.523
Invisibility on yourself and wait.

00:34:25.523 --> 00:34:31.913
SAM: And then I start digging through my pockets, 
if I have any flint or fire-making apparatus at all.

00:34:32.006 --> 00:34:33.543
MATT: Check your equipment.

00:34:33.543 --> 00:34:35.228
SAM: I will. I will look.

00:34:35.228 --> 00:34:36.552
MARISHA: Do you have an adventurer's kit?

00:34:36.552 --> 00:34:38.487
SAM: Nope. I have some poison.

00:34:38.487 --> 00:34:41.145
MATT: Poison the house. There you go. That'll
work.

00:34:41.145 --> 00:34:47.342
TRAVIS: We are the best planners. Ever.

00:34:47.342 --> 00:34:48.937
MATT: I know, you guys are rocking it.

00:34:48.937 --> 00:34:50.042
SAM: Oh wait, I do have something.

00:34:50.042 --> 00:34:51.091
LAURA: Yeah? You do?!

00:34:51.091 --> 00:34:53.670
SAM: I have a Potion of Fire Breath.

00:34:53.670 --> 00:34:55.182
MATT: You do.

00:34:55.182 --> 00:34:56.583
MARISHA: Okay!

00:34:56.583 --> 00:34:57.976
LAURA: It's raining up there.

00:34:57.976 --> 00:35:01.495
SAM: Well, but it's a potion. I don't know how it
works!

00:35:01.495 --> 00:35:05.567
MATT: You're checking your pockets. You find the
potion. You look down and you notice, even through

00:35:05.567 --> 00:35:13.737
the storm, you can see in the distance, there's
the dark shape of a giant lumbering zombie guard

00:35:13.737 --> 00:35:17.062
making its way down to this part of the town. What
are you doing?

00:35:17.062 --> 00:35:21.278
SAM: So I'm on a roof that's all soaking wet,
right?

00:35:21.278 --> 00:35:22.122
MATT: Yeah.

00:35:22.122 --> 00:35:25.559
SAM: There's no crawl space access? No attic I can
get to?

00:35:25.559 --> 00:35:27.079
MATT: Make a perception check.

00:35:27.079 --> 00:35:33.977
SAM: Okay. Whoa, nothing. Two.

00:35:33.977 --> 00:35:39.515
MATT: Two? This is a pretty solid roof with
apparently no entry point at any points. The

00:35:39.515 --> 00:35:41.279
craftsmanship is flawless.

00:35:41.279 --> 00:35:51.955
SAM: Okay. You know what? I'll just try it. I will
Fire Breath Potion myself.

00:35:51.955 --> 00:35:55.275
MATT: Okay, you pull up (boink), pull the cork
off, (glug glug).

00:35:55.275 --> 00:35:57.526
SAM: I don't know what this thing does. I've just
got this.

00:35:57.526 --> 00:36:02.333
MATT: As you feel the fluid find its way down your
esophagus, it warms it like a fine whiskey would,

00:36:02.333 --> 00:36:07.245
but the warmth just grows and grows to the point
where it's almost too hot, but it never quite

00:36:07.245 --> 00:36:11.666
reaches a point where it's painful, but you feel
as if this need to belch is burbling within your

00:36:11.666 --> 00:36:15.286
stomach, and at any given point in time, you could
let that belch fly forward.

00:36:15.286 --> 00:36:21.507
SAM: Okay. And am I close to the entry point roof?
The roof of the entry point?

00:36:21.507 --> 00:36:22.721
MATT: Where you came in?

00:36:22.721 --> 00:36:24.215
SAM: Can I get over there?

00:36:24.215 --> 00:36:27.278
MATT: Yeah, you just come running across the
rooftop. It's a little bit of up and down as the

00:36:27.278 --> 00:36:32.007
topography happens, and as you're running, you
start hearing voices shouting out in the street.

00:36:32.007 --> 00:36:37.557
You make your way over to the top of the roof
above.

00:36:37.557 --> 00:36:45.798
SAM: Okay, so I'm just going to lean over the side
and scorch the whole front entrance as much as I

00:36:45.798 --> 00:36:47.551
can from where I am.

00:36:47.551 --> 00:36:54.431
MATT: Okay. As you (grunts) let the belch out, it
comes out in a large spray of orange, yellow, and

00:36:54.431 --> 00:36:59.225
red flames that immediately burst beneath the
overhang, which--

00:36:59.225 --> 00:37:01.495
SAM: By the way, I'm also invisible, right?

00:37:01.495 --> 00:37:05.782
MATT: You are no longer, unfortunately. When you
do an attack of some kind, the invisibility is

00:37:05.782 --> 00:37:13.556
released. So this gnome appears, soaking wet, over
the edge of the roof and then releases this gout of

00:37:13.587 --> 00:37:18.783
fire that blankets the front of the building,
catching flames on all the portions of the front

00:37:18.783 --> 00:37:23.174
part of the second, and parts of the first story,
including the top of the entryway that you had

00:37:23.174 --> 00:37:27.410
already smashed through as a triceratops, which
exposed a lot of dried wood. It immediately bursts

00:37:27.410 --> 00:37:33.825
into flame. As you complete that breath and you
inhale for a second, you hear voices now starting

00:37:33.825 --> 00:37:37.139
to shout from the inside of the house. (muffled
shouting) You can't really make out the noises,

00:37:37.139 --> 00:37:40.338
but it sounds like there's panic now starting to
hit from the inside, and you see a few guards

00:37:40.338 --> 00:37:46.699
start rushing out into the street to try and look
at where the source of the flames came from. They

00:37:46.699 --> 00:37:48.219
both look up and see you.

00:37:48.219 --> 00:37:50.708
SAM: Oh, great! Wait, these are guards who are
outside, yeah?

00:37:50.708 --> 00:37:53.838
MATT: These are guards who were inside the house
that as soon as the fire came shooting down and

00:37:53.838 --> 00:37:58.177
burned the house, they rush out, look up, grab
their crossbows, and aim them up towards you.

00:37:58.177 --> 00:37:59.989
TRAVIS: Just your hands and head are sticking
over.

00:37:59.989 --> 00:38:01.378
MATT: That's a 17?

00:38:01.378 --> 00:38:02.905
SAM: That hits.

00:38:02.905 --> 00:38:04.182
MATT: And a 13.

00:38:04.182 --> 00:38:05.897
TALIESIN: Doesn't he have at least half-cover from
the roof?

00:38:06.002 --> 00:38:07.143
MATT: He does, actually.

00:38:07.143 --> 00:38:08.253
SAM: That does not hit.

00:38:08.253 --> 00:38:09.268
MATT: 17 does not hit.

00:38:09.268 --> 00:38:11.157
SAM: Oh, no, the 17 does-- well, it would have.

00:38:11.157 --> 00:38:15.570
MATT: That's a good point. You would have half-
cover from looking over the rooftop; you only have

00:38:15.712 --> 00:38:19.631
a little bit of your hands and your face showing.
So both go (pshew pshew), firing off into the

00:38:19.631 --> 00:38:20.462
rainstorm.

00:38:20.462 --> 00:38:22.273
SAM: Because I'm a gnome, do I always have half-
cover?

00:38:22.273 --> 00:38:23.394
(laughter)

00:38:23.420 --> 00:38:27.343
MATT: No. But it's easier for you to find it. It's
a lot less to cover.

00:38:27.343 --> 00:38:28.361
SAM: Okay.

00:38:28.361 --> 00:38:33.795
MATT: So both bolts (shoosh) streak past you into
the sky. They angrily reach down and duck back

00:38:33.795 --> 00:38:37.010
inside the building with the rest of their
movement to get out of the range of now what

00:38:37.010 --> 00:38:42.979
appears to be a flame-throwing gnome. So that's
their go. What are you going to do?

00:38:43.079 --> 00:38:48.481
SAM: Do I know enough about this potion to know if
it gives me any other breaths, or is that it?

00:38:48.481 --> 00:38:50.520
MATT: It does progressively give you a breath for
a short time.

00:38:50.520 --> 00:38:52.722
SAM: So I can breathe again?

00:38:52.722 --> 00:38:55.399
MATT: Yeah. Specifically-- oh no!

00:38:55.399 --> 00:38:57.405
(laughter)

00:38:57.405 --> 00:38:58.679
MATT: And that was the end of Scanlan.

00:38:58.679 --> 00:39:00.874
LIAM: It's the giant! It's the undead giant!

00:39:00.874 --> 00:39:05.356
SAM: I have no idea what I'm doing.

00:39:05.356 --> 00:39:08.166
TALIESIN: You're doing so well. It's so great.

00:39:08.166 --> 00:39:17.076
MATT: You have three different exhales of this.
It lasts for an hour or until you exhale three

00:39:17.109 --> 00:39:21.896
times. It's a bonus action to do it, so you could
also do something else and breathe fire.

00:39:21.896 --> 00:39:23.299
SAM: It's a bonus action?!

00:39:23.299 --> 00:39:24.249
MATT: Yep.

00:39:24.249 --> 00:39:25.900
SAM: Okay. Well, then.

00:39:25.900 --> 00:39:29.532
TRAVIS: I don't know if that house is cooked
enough, man.

00:39:29.532 --> 00:39:31.616
LAURA: I know, maybe you should just keep burning
it.

00:39:31.616 --> 00:39:35.410
SAM: (laughs) Yeah. So I'll run over to the back
side of the house and do the same thing.

00:39:35.410 --> 00:39:42.900
MATT: Okay. So you run over. Your full movement
will get you about halfway across. At a dash,

00:39:42.900 --> 00:39:47.255
we'll get your other action there, and you'll have
your bonus action left over. You manage to slide

00:39:47.255 --> 00:39:54.605
across the roof, grab the edge, reach over and
(blows air). Just unleash on the opposite side.

00:39:54.605 --> 00:39:59.856
This side, because the angle the rain is coming
at, is getting a little bit of water, but there is

00:39:59.856 --> 00:40:03.772
still a number of dry wood exposed by the
immediate overhang that it does manage to catch,

00:40:03.772 --> 00:40:07.448
and the flames are beginning to burn up and
collect on the sides because it is superheated

00:40:07.448 --> 00:40:12.184
flame. Both sides of the house now appear to be on
fire. Looking over your shoulder, you can see now

00:40:12.184 --> 00:40:17.894
there is a pillar of black smoke rising up from
the front of the building. You do see on the

00:40:17.894 --> 00:40:23.721
opposite side a hatch (click, bam) slam open and
you see a giant, meaty goliath hand (boof)--

00:40:23.721 --> 00:40:25.263
LAURA: Oh no!

00:40:25.263 --> 00:40:32.458
MATT: Now stepping out into the rain, you see the
goliath Duke Vedmeyer step up (doosh) with his

00:40:32.458 --> 00:40:33.876
two-handed sword.

00:40:33.876 --> 00:40:37.757
SAM: Shit. (shouting) Lovely home you've got
here!

00:40:37.757 --> 00:40:52.619
TRAVIS: It's like Duel of the Fates. On a burning
rooftop in the rain. (laughing) Giant goliath and

00:40:52.619 --> 00:40:55.455
a gnome who spits fire.

00:40:55.455 --> 00:40:59.969
MATT: All right, it's your turn.

00:40:59.969 --> 00:41:05.303
SAM: Okay. How close is his hatch to the edge?

00:41:05.303 --> 00:41:10.957
MATT: The hatch is actually halfway. It's in the
middle of the roof. It's actually met from the

00:41:10.957 --> 00:41:16.228
second story, from one of the rooms or one of the
closets, so it's about 25 feet from either the

00:41:16.228 --> 00:41:19.522
front or the back side. It's right in the center
of the house.

00:41:19.522 --> 00:41:22.652
SAM: (frantic breathing) Okay.

00:41:22.652 --> 00:41:24.275
MATT: Whatcha got, Scanlan? Whatcha got?

00:41:24.275 --> 00:41:27.648
SAM: (muffled) I'm trying. I'm just seeing range
here.

00:41:27.690 --> 00:41:34.003
MARISHA: It looks like a Frank Miller comic right
now. It's what I see in my head.

00:41:34.003 --> 00:41:35.737
MATT: Scanlan showing down in the rain.

00:41:35.737 --> 00:41:40.497
SAM: Five times your Spellcasting ability
modifier. My Spellcasting ability modifier is--

00:41:40.497 --> 00:41:41.586
what?

00:41:41.586 --> 00:41:43.221
MATT: It's charisma.

00:41:43.257 --> 00:41:49.874
SAM: It's charisma. It's five. Five times five,
that's 25. That's 25 feet. Okay. (sings) Bigby's

00:41:49.874 --> 00:41:58.641
Hand! So I call forth Bigby's Hand and
I will force him off the roof.

00:41:58.641 --> 00:42:00.923
(cheering)

00:42:00.923 --> 00:42:04.899
MATT: Okay. All right.

00:42:04.899 --> 00:42:07.375
TALIESIN: The roof is wet.

00:42:07.375 --> 00:42:11.472
MATT: The roof is indeed wet. I'm aware. (laughs)
Oh, this will be interesting.

00:42:11.472 --> 00:42:13.933
SAM: (sings) I want to fly away.

00:42:13.933 --> 00:42:18.790
TALIESIN, MARISHA, AND SAM: (sing) Yeah, yeah,
yeah.

00:42:18.790 --> 00:42:23.548
MATT: Okay. So you create the hand next to him,
and as he starts stepping forward towards you with

00:42:23.548 --> 00:42:28.285
his sword at the ready, there's a shimmer in the
air as a giant kind of vaguely purplish arcane

00:42:28.285 --> 00:42:33.276
hand all of a sudden appears. He looks confused
for a second and rears back to try and attack it.

00:42:33.276 --> 00:42:38.675
As the hand pulls back, comes rushing
forward towards him, I want you to go ahead and

00:42:38.675 --> 00:42:41.289
make a strength check with the hand.

00:42:41.289 --> 00:42:42.805
SAM: Oh shit, he's strong.

00:42:42.805 --> 00:42:45.550
MATT: The strength is plus eight, so add eight to
this roll.

00:42:45.550 --> 00:42:49.064
SAM: 17 plus eight...

00:42:49.099 --> 00:42:50.790
MATT: (laughs) Natural one.

00:42:50.904 --> 00:42:56.426
(cheering)

00:42:56.495 --> 00:42:58.612
SAM: I'm going to kill everyone in this
motherfucking house!

00:42:58.755 --> 00:43:00.762
(laughter)

00:43:00.762 --> 00:43:02.957
MATT: I've rolled so many ones today. This is
ridiculous.

00:43:02.957 --> 00:43:05.005
MARISHA: You have, and we're just getting
started.

00:43:05.005 --> 00:43:08.633
MATT: All right. The hand pushes him five feet
plus the number of feet equal to five times your

00:43:08.633 --> 00:43:16.463
spellcasting modifier. Yeah. Okay. As the hand
shoves him, he goes pushed off to this side. Seems

00:43:16.463 --> 00:43:19.853
to be holding against it, but the hand eventually
scoops him up and actually gets him off of his

00:43:19.853 --> 00:43:27.190
feet and shot-puts him off the roof. He plummets
backward off the side of the roof, and

00:43:27.295 --> 00:43:41.564
you wait a second to hear a (boof) across the way.
That's full damage there. (mutters) Okay, he

00:43:41.564 --> 00:43:46.335
takes 34 points of falling damage and is knocked
prone.

00:43:46.335 --> 00:43:49.609
LIAM: You can't get this on network television,
ladies and gentlemen.

00:43:49.609 --> 00:43:53.689
MATT: So you're now standing alone on the rooftop,
your Bigby Hand there next to you, a little

00:43:53.689 --> 00:43:58.114
trickle of fire curling at the corner of your
mouth from your final dragon's breath when you

00:43:58.114 --> 00:44:01.419
decide to use it. What are you going to do?

00:44:01.419 --> 00:44:04.778
SAM: Oh. I've got to get out of here. (laughs)

00:44:04.778 --> 00:44:06.270
TRAVIS: Just burn it.

00:44:06.270 --> 00:44:08.256
LAURA: Burn in the hatch and then get out.

00:44:08.256 --> 00:44:10.987
SAM: Okay. Am I close to the hatch?

00:44:10.987 --> 00:44:13.265
MATT: Yeah, you're about 25 feet from it. It's
where you got him.

00:44:13.265 --> 00:44:22.510
SAM: I'll hoof it over there and just look around
and punch myself in the gut, (belch).

00:44:22.510 --> 00:44:27.089
MATT: Okay. As you reach over, you look down, and
there is a ladder that leads up to the front, and

00:44:27.089 --> 00:44:30.647
there are two guards that are currently making
their way up to the roof. They look up and see

00:44:30.647 --> 00:44:34.817
you, and their eyes go wide within their helmets,
and as you release the flames, all you see is

00:44:34.817 --> 00:44:41.675
their faces go, "Ah!" Just engulfing the
entire tunnel. Roll 4d6.

00:44:41.675 --> 00:44:43.723
MARISHA and SAM: 4d6?

00:44:43.723 --> 00:44:44.624
MATT: Yes.

00:44:44.624 --> 00:44:46.009
SAM: I don't have any d6.

00:44:46.009 --> 00:44:51.116
MATT: There you go. They both fail their DC 13
dexterity saving throws because I can't roll

00:44:51.116 --> 00:44:52.288
tonight.

00:44:52.288 --> 00:44:53.461
SAM: 15.

00:44:53.461 --> 00:44:59.498
MATT: 15? Okay. They both take 15 points of fire
damage and the entirety of that space has now

00:44:59.498 --> 00:45:04.338
burst into flames. You pull back because the heat
is intense, backdraft-style, as you're at the top.

00:45:04.338 --> 00:45:05.858
SAM: Do my eyebrows burn off?

00:45:05.858 --> 00:45:08.392
MATT: They don't burn off, but you feel they might
be a little singed. You'd have to give it a few days

00:45:08.392 --> 00:45:13.330
to recover. And you hear screaming down inside the
tunnel and both of them are currently dealing with

00:45:13.439 --> 00:45:18.300
the fact that they're on fire. So that's your
movement, that's your bonus action. You still have

00:45:18.300 --> 00:45:19.581
an action.

00:45:19.581 --> 00:45:25.395
SAM: Okay. I've got to get the hell out of here,
guys. Okay, tell me this, Dungeon Master.

00:45:25.395 --> 00:45:26.471
MATT: Yes?

00:45:26.471 --> 00:45:30.021
SAM: Dimension Door. Can it be used at higher
levels?

00:45:30.021 --> 00:45:34.305
MATT: Let me double-check on that, actually. I
don't know if it can, but we'll find out.

00:45:34.305 --> 00:45:38.113
LAURA: Can you Bigby's-Hand slam down onto the
Count?

00:45:38.113 --> 00:45:40.583
MATT: Dimension Door, no. Dimension Door cannot.

00:45:40.685 --> 00:45:43.167
SAM: Okay. How about Polymorph?

00:45:43.167 --> 00:45:45.767
MATT: Polymorph... nope.

00:45:45.767 --> 00:45:48.937
SAM: I'm fucked. (laughs)

00:45:48.937 --> 00:45:50.929
LAURA: You've used all your spell slots?

00:45:50.929 --> 00:45:54.193
TALIESIN: You can use Bigby's Hand to--

00:45:54.193 --> 00:45:58.978
SAM: I don't know if Bigby's Hand can catch me.
It's not like Feather Fall.

00:45:58.978 --> 00:46:00.200
MARISHA: Can it carry you?

00:46:00.200 --> 00:46:01.291
LAURA: Can you float?

00:46:01.291 --> 00:46:03.349
TRAVIS: Maybe it's like a slide.

00:46:03.349 --> 00:46:05.643
LAURA: Maybe you can slide down Bigby's Hand.

00:46:05.643 --> 00:46:07.261
TALIESIN: Fly it like the carpet.

00:46:07.261 --> 00:46:09.000
MATT: Do you want to try?

00:46:09.000 --> 00:46:10.754
TRAVIS: You're welcome to try.

00:46:10.754 --> 00:46:13.718
LIAM: Yeah, you've lifted people with it. You've
grabbed people.

00:46:13.718 --> 00:46:16.155
TRAVIS: I mean, ultimately, on foot sucks for him
right now.

00:46:16.155 --> 00:46:18.888
MARISHA: Just surf on the giant floating hand.

00:46:18.888 --> 00:46:20.118
TALIESIN: Through the sky.

00:46:20.118 --> 00:46:21.713
MARISHA: Through the sky.

00:46:21.713 --> 00:46:24.015
LIAM: Is what your friends would say if they were
there.

00:46:24.015 --> 00:46:24.874
MARISHA: Yeah.

00:46:24.874 --> 00:46:27.285
TRAVIS: All you've got to do is get away for this
to be amazing.

00:46:27.285 --> 00:46:31.486
LAURA: Otherwise, you'll burn alive on a roof.

00:46:31.597 --> 00:46:33.251
MARISHA: All you have to do is live.

00:46:33.251 --> 00:46:34.738
LIAM: Comically tragic.

00:46:34.738 --> 00:46:35.980
MATT: What are you doing?

00:46:35.980 --> 00:46:38.628
SAM: Okay. Does Unseen Servant have any mass?

00:46:38.628 --> 00:46:44.736
MATT: Not really, no. Unseen Servant is like a
barely-there small-level air elemental.

00:46:44.736 --> 00:47:00.973
SAM: Okay. So I'm just going to (hums a bit, then
sings) I'm jumping in the rain. I'm jump--

00:47:01.079 --> 00:47:05.649
so I'm going to jump off the-- can I go away from
the Goliath?

00:47:05.649 --> 00:47:08.622
MATT: That would be this way, this way, or this
way, because he fell off that side.

00:47:08.622 --> 00:47:10.719
SAM: So not the two sides that are on fire.

00:47:10.719 --> 00:47:15.048
MATT: The flames are now licking up both sides of
the house, so you have to go this way.

00:47:15.048 --> 00:47:17.126
TRAVIS: Where's the zombie stone giant now?

00:47:17.126 --> 00:47:19.918
SAM: It's going to take a couple of turns to get
over there.

00:47:19.918 --> 00:47:23.963
MATT: Yeah, the full length of it. At full dash it will
get you there and there, and you still have about

00:47:24.060 --> 00:47:26.426
a good 20 more feet to get, so that's your turn,
there.

00:47:26.426 --> 00:47:27.656
SAM: Okay.

00:47:27.656 --> 00:47:35.948
MATT: The two guards that were back that way are
now no longer on fire. They have gotten to the

00:47:35.948 --> 00:47:40.307
roof and put themselves out. They both look very,
very angry at the current circumstance. They step

00:47:40.307 --> 00:47:42.151
out of the hatch both places.

00:47:42.151 --> 00:47:43.629
LIAM: Different hatch or the same hatch?

00:47:43.629 --> 00:47:44.994
TRAVIS: The hatch is on fire?

00:47:44.994 --> 00:47:48.669
MATT: The hatch is still on fire, there are still
flames, but they got out (panting). They're out in

00:47:48.669 --> 00:47:51.711
the rain now. The rain's putting out and dousing
the flame that's on them. They both look over and

00:47:51.711 --> 00:47:56.985
see you running away. They pull their hand
crossbows at the ready. They were already ready to

00:47:57.027 --> 00:48:02.696
fire. That's a 24? And a 26.

00:48:02.696 --> 00:48:07.701
SAM: For the second guy, I-- no, I'll just take
it. Okay.

00:48:07.701 --> 00:48:14.617
MATT: Okay, they both hit. They had 24 and 26.
That is seven points of piercing damage and 12

00:48:14.617 --> 00:48:17.975
points of piercing damage. So 19 total.

00:48:17.975 --> 00:48:19.572
SAM: Okay, got it.

00:48:19.572 --> 00:48:22.847
MATT: All righty. They both reach over and grab
bolts out of their sides and start preparing for

00:48:22.847 --> 00:48:27.551
another series of shots. Both catch you in the
side. One you can feel a few inches into your

00:48:27.551 --> 00:48:32.280
shoulder and it's making the joint stick, and the
pain is starting to really burn on the left side

00:48:32.280 --> 00:48:35.465
of your body, but you're okay. Now it's your
turn.

00:48:35.465 --> 00:48:41.253
SAM: Okay. I look back at them and I do that thing
where you just kind of do this.

00:48:41.253 --> 00:48:42.623
(laughter)

00:48:42.623 --> 00:48:43.755
MARISHA: Trust fall?

00:48:43.755 --> 00:48:45.336
SAM: And I trust fall off the back of it.

00:48:45.336 --> 00:48:46.618
LIAM: Do you have the earring in?

00:48:46.618 --> 00:48:52.324
SAM: Oh, I do. (laughs) But I'm going to
simultaneously make Bigby's Hand try to catch me

00:48:52.324 --> 00:48:53.949
at the bottom of it.

00:48:53.949 --> 00:48:59.286
MATT: Go ahead and roll a d20 and add your
charisma modifier to it.

00:48:59.286 --> 00:49:00.288
SAM: Charisma?

00:49:00.288 --> 00:49:01.622
MATT: Yeah.

00:49:01.622 --> 00:49:03.947
SAM: That's 20.

00:49:03.990 --> 00:49:09.331
MATT: 20? You trust-fall off, your eyes somewhat
closed and letting it happen.

00:49:09.331 --> 00:49:11.015
SAM: Come on, Bigby. Catch me.

00:49:11.015 --> 00:49:15.679
MATT: And in the moment that you expect ground to
meet you with a heavy, hard smack of reality, a

00:49:15.679 --> 00:49:22.594
soft cushion of arcane energy catches you as these
spiritual purplish fingers curl around and gently

00:49:22.594 --> 00:49:24.088
bring you to the ground.

00:49:24.088 --> 00:49:25.207
TRAVIS: Beymaxed it.

00:49:25.207 --> 00:49:26.591
SAM: Oh! Don't get handsy, Bigby.

00:49:26.591 --> 00:49:28.113
(laughter)

00:49:28.113 --> 00:49:29.455
LAURA: Austin Powers.

00:49:29.455 --> 00:49:33.748
SAM: All right. Is that my turn?

00:49:33.748 --> 00:49:38.703
MATT: Oh, that was just the fall, and you land
there. He's way over this way. So you're outside

00:49:38.703 --> 00:49:43.315
of the house now. You're in a small alley
between-- well, not an alley. You're on the side

00:49:43.315 --> 00:49:47.614
of the house and there's a big grassy area around
it, and there's the fence that surrounds the

00:49:47.614 --> 00:49:48.655
whole...

00:49:48.655 --> 00:49:49.898
LIAM: Run, Forrest.

00:49:49.898 --> 00:49:54.655
SAM: So I'm going to-- do I get an action? No,
Bigby's is a bonus action.

00:49:54.655 --> 00:50:01.015
MATT: It's an action to use its ability, so it was
your action to catch you as part of it.

00:50:01.015 --> 00:50:02.295
SAM: It's an action?

00:50:02.295 --> 00:50:04.492
MATT: To do anything with Bigby's Hand.

00:50:04.492 --> 00:50:10.639
SAM: It says, "and as a bonus action on subsequent
turns."

00:50:10.639 --> 00:50:12.322
MATT: Oh, it's a bonus action?

00:50:12.322 --> 00:50:17.184
SAM: Oh, wait. No, that's for moving it. The bonus
action is moving it. I got it.

00:50:17.184 --> 00:50:18.295
MATT: Yeah.

00:50:18.295 --> 00:50:19.279
SAM: Okay.

00:50:19.279 --> 00:50:20.943
MATT: So you've been moving it along with you as
you go.

00:50:20.943 --> 00:50:22.537
SAM: Yeah, but the act of catching me was the
action.

00:50:22.537 --> 00:50:23.395
MATT: Yeah.

00:50:23.395 --> 00:50:25.516
SAM: Got it. Okay. So I'll just start running.
(laughs)

00:50:25.516 --> 00:50:27.048
MATT: Okay. So you're going to start running over
this way.

00:50:27.048 --> 00:50:29.484
SAM: On my tiny little nubby legs.

00:50:29.484 --> 00:50:39.776
MATT: All right. As you run, you get over to the
front of the gate that is closed off. It's a

00:50:39.776 --> 00:50:43.987
little bit too tight for you to squeeze through.
How do you plan to get over the gate?

00:50:43.987 --> 00:50:46.186
SAM: I'm planning to climb over the gate.

00:50:46.186 --> 00:50:47.094
MATT: Okay.

00:50:47.094 --> 00:50:48.958
SAM: (laughs) I've got nothing left.

00:50:48.958 --> 00:50:51.926
MATT: Make an athletics or acrobatics check to try
and get over the gate.

00:50:51.926 --> 00:50:54.870
LIAM: Whatever the better number is. Whatever's
better: athletics or acrobatics.

00:50:54.870 --> 00:50:57.517
SAM: They're both pretty terrible. 16.

00:50:57.517 --> 00:51:00.041
MATT: 16. Okay. Is that acrobatics or athletics?

00:51:00.041 --> 00:51:01.737
SAM: That's athletics.

00:51:01.737 --> 00:51:05.878
MATT: Athletics. So you run, you jump up (ching),
grab onto the metal bars to start just pulling

00:51:05.878 --> 00:51:11.650
yourself up over the top, land on your feet, and
you're now right near where the street is, and you

00:51:11.650 --> 00:51:16.743
can see to your right it's open, towards the
direction of where the rest of the party is. To

00:51:16.743 --> 00:51:21.040
the left, you can see now, coming through the rain
about a hundred feet from you, a giant hulking

00:51:21.081 --> 00:51:27.285
zombie giant that's stomping towards you. As you
notice that, you see a number of figures come

00:51:27.285 --> 00:51:32.271
swarming out of the two buildings to the side of
it, and immediately start attacking the zombie giant.

00:51:32.271 --> 00:51:36.447
TRAVIS AND LIAM: Go, go, get out.

00:51:36.447 --> 00:51:38.235
MARISHA: They're attacking the--

00:51:38.235 --> 00:51:40.150
LAURA: They're attacking the zombie giant. That's
good.

00:51:40.150 --> 00:51:42.269
LIAM: You have inspired people. G-T-F-O, man.

00:51:42.269 --> 00:51:50.142
SAM: Yeah. I'm useless to you guys. Yeah, I'm
going to go invisible and watch from the shadows.

00:51:50.142 --> 00:51:55.764
MATT: Okay. So you just cloak yourself and watch
from the shadows off to the side. As you are there

00:51:55.764 --> 00:51:59.108
for a little bit, keeping your eye out for the
next couple of minutes, you can see the house is

00:51:59.108 --> 00:52:04.889
now completely engulfed in flames. The rain, try
as it might-- the roof itself is not catching yet,

00:52:04.889 --> 00:52:09.199
but you can see now, fire is licking out of every
single window and glass is steadily breaking over

00:52:09.199 --> 00:52:13.838
time. (crash, crash) The guards have all escaped
out, and you can see the guards and Vedmeyer are

00:52:13.838 --> 00:52:18.010
now storming across the entire grounds. He's
giving orders left and right, and they're all out

00:52:18.010 --> 00:52:20.950
searching for you in the nearby vicinity of the
home.

00:52:20.950 --> 00:52:25.764
Looking across the way, you can see the zombie
giant is now currently reaching down and swapping

00:52:25.764 --> 00:52:31.384
down. You can get a closer view. They look like
some of the normal inhabitants here, are wearing

00:52:31.384 --> 00:52:38.790
makeshift armor, weapons that they have, and they
are now rising up and attempting to take down this

00:52:38.790 --> 00:52:42.918
zombie giant. You watch as it reaches out. It
slams and smashes one to the ground, leaving him

00:52:42.918 --> 00:52:46.649
lifeless, while another two leap up on the back of
the zombie giant and are stabbing it with spears,

00:52:46.760 --> 00:52:52.181
and you see it (moaning), it gives out this roar.
It's hard to tell from this distance which side is

00:52:52.181 --> 00:52:57.389
getting any ground, but it is currently held up by
this group of about ten individuals that are

00:52:57.389 --> 00:52:58.626
attacking it at once.

00:52:58.626 --> 00:52:59.475
SAM: It's cool.

00:52:59.475 --> 00:53:00.507
MARISHA: That's so cool.

00:53:00.507 --> 00:53:01.843
MATT: You just going to stay there and wait it
out?

00:53:01.843 --> 00:53:05.912
SAM: I think I'll wait it out if I'm in a
relatively safe place, because I can't really do

00:53:05.912 --> 00:53:08.510
anything for you guys, anyway. You're on your
own.

00:53:08.510 --> 00:53:12.000
MATT: Okay. We'll use that to hop over to the
other party.

00:53:12.000 --> 00:53:14.921
SAM: Oh, I'm taking a short rest.

00:53:14.921 --> 00:53:16.390
LAURA: Oh, that's good! Yes.

00:53:16.390 --> 00:53:19.099
MATT: A short rest is about half an hour to 40
minutes of waiting, so you might want to find a

00:53:19.099 --> 00:53:23.784
place that isn't quite so intense to do this. You
can try and sneak into one of the nearby homes and

00:53:23.784 --> 00:53:24.828
do it, maybe.

00:53:24.828 --> 00:53:27.269
SAM: Well, I still want to see where this giant
thing goes, so I'm still watching it.

00:53:27.269 --> 00:53:30.627
MATT: Okay, so you would not be able to rest,
unfortunately. It's not a very restful situation

00:53:30.627 --> 00:53:33.058
right now, to gather yourself. Okay.

00:53:33.058 --> 00:53:34.870
SAM: Whew! I lived.

00:53:34.870 --> 00:53:38.038
LAURA: I like that Scanlan takes out an entire
house, and we're all probably going to die.

00:53:38.038 --> 00:53:41.308
TRAVIS: Dude, you were fucking Rambo just then.
You were Scanlan Rambo.

00:53:41.308 --> 00:53:42.752
LAURA: You're a legend.

00:53:42.752 --> 00:53:46.251
TRAVIS: Do you have any red cloth you can tear off
and tie around your forehead?

00:53:46.251 --> 00:53:48.769
LIAM: Is your beret still on?

00:53:48.769 --> 00:53:51.712
SAM: (laughs) I never got a beret. Did I get a
beret?

00:53:51.712 --> 00:53:53.167
TALIESIN: You did get a beret. I thought you got a
beret.

00:53:53.167 --> 00:53:54.418
SAM: Yeah, I wanted a beret.

00:53:54.418 --> 00:53:55.673
TRAVIS: That was outstanding.

00:53:55.673 --> 00:53:58.952
(laughter)

00:53:58.952 --> 00:54:08.727
MATT: I approve of this greatly. All righty. The
rest of you guys who have all been slinking out

00:54:08.727 --> 00:54:12.830
the back. You just knocked a guard out. Trinket
came with you?

00:54:12.830 --> 00:54:14.851
LAURA: Trinket went with Grog.

00:54:14.851 --> 00:54:16.635
MATT: Grog. Right, that's right!

00:54:16.635 --> 00:54:21.106
LAURA: You can do it, buddy!

00:54:21.106 --> 00:54:28.644
MATT: Percy, Vex, you guys are all back this way.
The back of the building. You can see what looks

00:54:28.644 --> 00:54:35.985
to be one door to a back room. Grog, as you come
slamming up with Trinket behind you (thudding

00:54:35.985 --> 00:54:39.802
footsteps) up to the front of the building, you
see the front doors are there before you.

00:54:39.802 --> 00:54:41.510
TRAVIS: Oh, they're in front of us?

00:54:41.510 --> 00:54:42.353
MATT: Yeah.

00:54:42.353 --> 00:54:43.389
TRAVIS: I'm already raging?

00:54:43.389 --> 00:54:44.084
MATT: Yeah.

00:54:44.084 --> 00:54:45.542
TRAVIS: I just fucking bust through,
apeshit-style.

00:54:45.542 --> 00:54:46.921
MATT: Okay. Make a strength check.

00:54:46.921 --> 00:54:47.710
TRAVIS: Okay.

00:54:47.710 --> 00:54:48.871
LAURA: Can I ask you, really fast?

00:54:48.871 --> 00:54:49.677
MATT: Yes.

00:54:49.677 --> 00:54:51.366
LAURA: I never leveled up Trinket's hit points
when I leveled up.

00:54:51.366 --> 00:54:53.969
MATT: You didn't. All right.

00:54:53.969 --> 00:54:56.057
LAURA: That's important at this moment.

00:54:56.057 --> 00:54:58.689
MATT: It is very important at this moment.

00:54:58.689 --> 00:55:00.882
TALIESIN: Ugh, why do you have to do that, man?

00:55:00.882 --> 00:55:02.389
MATT: Trinket's hit points right now are what?

00:55:02.389 --> 00:55:03.600
LAURA: 56.

00:55:03.600 --> 00:55:04.733
MATT: 56.

00:55:04.733 --> 00:55:13.007
MARISHA: This Elder Scrolls music is pretty dope.

00:55:13.007 --> 00:55:14.672
LIAM: Bringing it home.

00:55:14.672 --> 00:55:16.466
MATT: Trinket should have four more hit points.

00:55:16.466 --> 00:55:17.259
LAURA: Four?

00:55:17.259 --> 00:55:20.527
MATT: Yeah. All righty.

00:55:20.527 --> 00:55:22.352
LIAM: Zac, adjusting the microphones.

00:55:22.352 --> 00:55:24.313
ZAC: Nobody knows. Nobody knew, until you said
something!

00:55:24.313 --> 00:55:27.690
TRAVIS: I got advantage on the strength check, so
it was a 26.

00:55:27.690 --> 00:55:29.068
MATT: 26?

00:55:29.068 --> 00:55:30.050
TRAVIS: Yes.

00:55:30.050 --> 00:55:34.427
MATT: You rush forward. With your foot, (boom)
it's Sparta, the front of that door as it just

00:55:34.427 --> 00:55:39.224
(crash) cracks open, Trinket coming up behind you.
The doors open. You can see now before you, there

00:55:39.224 --> 00:55:45.274
is a single staircase that curves up to a second
floor. There is a large vase right at the base of

00:55:45.274 --> 00:55:48.939
it, right there. There's a couple of tables by it,
and it goes to the right and left. Do you enter

00:55:49.027 --> 00:55:52.425
the premises, or are you staying right at the
door? It's up to you.

00:55:52.425 --> 00:55:54.263
TRAVIS: Yeah, I go in.

00:55:54.263 --> 00:55:58.358
MATT: All right. Grog, you push your way in,
Trinket following behind you right there.

00:55:58.358 --> 00:56:06.407
Immediately, you see the upper banister, right
over the railing also, similar to what Scanlan

00:56:06.407 --> 00:56:24.399
encountered, has guards completely within this
area, at the ready, crossbows pulled. In wait.

00:56:24.399 --> 00:56:30.837
LAURA: Oh, god. He just keeps adding them!

00:56:30.837 --> 00:56:35.494
LIAM: Just 12 more.

00:56:35.494 --> 00:56:39.944
MARISHA: Cool.

00:56:39.944 --> 00:56:47.287
MATT: There is Tylieri. All waiting, crossbows at
the ready. The doors slam open, you guys rush in.

00:56:47.287 --> 00:56:51.549
For a second, there's nothing immediately within
your range, and you look up and see an entire

00:56:51.549 --> 00:56:58.551
array of guards all trained upon you and Trinket.
A voice behind them goes, "Loose!" (fshh)

00:56:58.609 --> 00:57:01.217
TRAVIS: At least Trinket's behind me.

00:57:01.310 --> 00:57:04.492
MATT: (chuckles) What's your armor class?

00:57:04.593 --> 00:57:07.104
TRAVIS: 19.

00:57:07.104 --> 00:57:11.557
LIAM: You're going to tell us when we can do
something in the back, right?

00:57:11.557 --> 00:57:16.054
MATT: Yep. This is just-- because of the speed
everything goes, he gets there before anybody.

00:57:16.054 --> 00:57:17.957
LIAM: Yeah. Just curious.

00:57:17.957 --> 00:57:23.467
MATT: No worries. All right, that is-- ooh. That
is 27 to hit?

00:57:23.467 --> 00:57:24.799
TRAVIS: Yep.

00:57:24.799 --> 00:57:34.109
MATT: That is 15 to hit? No. Third one, that is 16
to hit? Nope. That is a 21 to hit?

00:57:34.109 --> 00:57:35.542
TRAVIS: Yep.

00:57:35.542 --> 00:57:38.258
MATT: 26 to hit.

00:57:38.258 --> 00:57:39.348
TRAVIS: Yes.

00:57:39.348 --> 00:57:41.801
MATT: That's a 22 to hit?

00:57:41.801 --> 00:57:42.763
TRAVIS: Yep.

00:57:42.763 --> 00:57:46.120
LAURA: All the shitty guards were over at the
other house.

00:57:46.120 --> 00:57:47.468
MATT: 14 to hit?

00:57:47.468 --> 00:57:48.570
TRAVIS: No.

00:57:48.570 --> 00:57:49.937
MATT: 20 to hit?

00:57:49.937 --> 00:57:51.111
TRAVIS: Yep.

00:57:51.111 --> 00:57:52.422
MATT: Then three more.

00:57:52.422 --> 00:57:54.141
TRAVIS: Yeah.

00:57:54.141 --> 00:57:56.769
MATT: 22 to hit?

00:57:56.769 --> 00:57:58.805
TRAVIS: Yep, that hits.

00:57:58.805 --> 00:58:00.344
MATT: 12 to hit?

00:58:00.344 --> 00:58:01.841
TRAVIS: No. Last one?

00:58:01.841 --> 00:58:03.615
MATT: And ten to hit. Yeah.

00:58:03.615 --> 00:58:04.626
MATT AND TRAVIS: Six.

00:58:04.626 --> 00:58:10.835
MATT: Six crossbow bolts come at you. That's eight
points of piercing damage. Don't halve them yet.

00:58:10.835 --> 00:58:12.648
We'll add them all up and then we'll halve that.

00:58:12.648 --> 00:58:13.680
TRAVIS: Okay.

00:58:13.680 --> 00:58:24.731
MATT: So, eight plus 13. 21. Plus eight again, 29.
Plus another nine.

00:58:24.731 --> 00:58:26.127
TRAVIS: 38.

00:58:26.127 --> 00:58:29.066
MATT: 38, plus another 11.

00:58:29.066 --> 00:58:30.609
TRAVIS: 49.

00:58:30.609 --> 00:58:34.878
MATT: So 49, and then another 12.

00:58:34.878 --> 00:58:38.411
LAURA: 61.

00:58:38.411 --> 00:58:43.252
MATT: So 61. So you take half that, which would be
31 points of piercing damage on you in one volley

00:58:43.252 --> 00:58:52.841
of crossbow bolts at you. (shoosh) You protected
Trinket, and the rage did descend it a little bit. The

00:58:52.841 --> 00:58:56.806
pain, as all these bolts are now sticking out of
your chest. You look like this front-quilled

00:58:56.839 --> 00:59:01.141
porcupine. You just take the pain and grin for a
second. You have that iron-y taste of blood reach

00:59:01.141 --> 00:59:06.931
the back of your throat from the immediate impact
and it just further intensifies your rage. I'm

00:59:06.981 --> 00:59:09.686
going to have everyone here roll initiative
because you're all acting simultaneously

00:59:09.686 --> 00:59:10.988
at this point.

00:59:10.988 --> 00:59:12.358
MARISHA: Which dice? Green dice.

00:59:12.358 --> 00:59:13.769
LAURA: I know, I'm like, "Which ones?"

00:59:13.769 --> 00:59:16.620
MARISHA: That was-- nope. Not good.

00:59:16.620 --> 00:59:24.496
MATT: All righty. 25 to 20?

00:59:24.496 --> 00:59:27.858
LAURA: Oh, should I roll for Trinket, too? Oh, he
goes when I go.

00:59:27.858 --> 00:59:29.162
MATT: Trinket goes when you go.

00:59:29.162 --> 00:59:30.343
LIAM: 23.

00:59:30.343 --> 00:59:39.523
MATT: 23? All right. We have Vax at the top. 20 to
15?

00:59:39.523 --> 00:59:40.811
TRAVIS: 18.

00:59:40.811 --> 00:59:41.886
LAURA: 17.

00:59:41.886 --> 00:59:43.628
MATT: All right.

00:59:43.628 --> 00:59:48.191
TRAVIS: Thanks to the Feral Instinct.

00:59:48.216 --> 00:59:53.960
MATT: All right. 15 to ten? Ten to five?

00:59:53.960 --> 00:59:55.290
TRAVIS: Oh, shit.

00:59:55.290 --> 00:59:56.449
MARISHA: Five.

00:59:56.449 --> 00:59:57.442
MATT: What did you get?

00:59:57.442 --> 00:59:58.396
SAM: I'm not there.

00:59:58.396 --> 00:59:59.486
MATT: Oh, no. Sorry, you're not.

00:59:59.486 --> 01:00:02.528
TALIESIN: I totally forgot. I'm so sorry. I'm at
26. I got distracted because I have a new--

01:00:02.528 --> 01:00:03.727
TRAVIS: Distracted by what?

01:00:03.727 --> 01:00:07.685
MATT: To be fair, I asked 25 to 20. (laughs)
That's my own fault.

01:00:07.735 --> 01:00:12.670
TALIESIN: I'm using my new sheet and I'm just
confused, so yeah.

01:00:12.670 --> 01:00:13.796
MATT: That's okay.

01:00:13.796 --> 01:00:15.172
LAURA: You're cheating?!

01:00:15.172 --> 01:00:17.882
TALIESIN: New sheet. I leveled up, so I had to do
a thing.

01:00:17.882 --> 01:00:21.370
MATT: By the way, guys, both Scanlan and Percy
leveled up this last time.

01:00:21.370 --> 01:00:23.762
TRAVIS: If only Rambo Scanlan was here.

01:00:23.762 --> 01:00:25.485
(laughter)

01:00:25.485 --> 01:00:27.167
LAURA: It's insane.

01:00:27.167 --> 01:00:32.607
MATT: So. We have at the top of this combat round,
Percy.

01:00:32.607 --> 01:00:36.150
TALIESIN: Oh boy. Okay, is there a way in?

01:00:36.150 --> 01:00:38.702
SAM: Are you getting a FaceTime?

01:00:38.702 --> 01:00:40.235
MATT: Am I?

01:00:40.235 --> 01:00:41.844
TALIESIN: Are you FaceTiming somebody?

01:00:41.844 --> 01:00:48.527
MATT: I'd better not be. That was weird. I don't
know what happened there. Anyway. Battle's still up.

01:00:48.527 --> 01:00:51.422
TALIESIN: So is there a way in, at this point?

01:00:51.422 --> 01:00:56.984
MATT: There is a door right here at the back of
the building that you can see, but the door is

01:00:56.984 --> 01:00:58.305
currently closed.

01:00:58.305 --> 01:01:01.385
TALIESIN: I'm running over to the door and opening
it. I can hear the commotion from inside, and I'm

01:01:01.385 --> 01:01:02.342
running in the door.

01:01:02.342 --> 01:01:04.687
MATT: Okay. You rush to the door. You go to try
it, (clicking). The door is locked.

01:01:04.687 --> 01:01:07.128
LIAM: Hold your turn, dude.

01:01:07.128 --> 01:01:08.903
TALIESIN: I'm holding my turn.

01:01:08.903 --> 01:01:10.643
MATT: You're going to hold your action.

01:01:10.643 --> 01:01:11.807
TALIESIN: I'm holding my action.

01:01:11.807 --> 01:01:12.882
MATT: Okay. That's fine.

01:01:12.882 --> 01:01:13.929
LIAM: All right, I'm up.

01:01:13.929 --> 01:01:15.013
MATT: Next up is Vax.

01:01:15.013 --> 01:01:17.818
LIAM: Yeah. I'm going to try to unlock the door.

01:01:17.818 --> 01:01:20.681
MATT: All right. You go ahead and you rush over
(whoosh), pull out your lockpicks.

01:01:20.681 --> 01:01:22.960
LIAM: So that's a ten. 23.

01:01:22.960 --> 01:01:27.658
MATT: Rain's still pouring down, you have your
hood up, the water's dripping past your face as

01:01:27.658 --> 01:01:31.521
you're trying to concentrate. You get the tools
in. It's not a very complicated lock. (click,

01:01:31.521 --> 01:01:35.904
creak) You push it open, leading you guys into the
interior of what looks like a kitchen.

01:01:35.904 --> 01:01:40.665
LIAM: Perception check. Which is a 25.

01:01:40.665 --> 01:01:46.235
MATT: 25. As you look inside, it's a cold kitchen.
It hasn't been in use for a while. The fire's up,

01:01:46.235 --> 01:01:50.836
there's a little bit of a slab in the corner where
most of the preparations are done, there's a few

01:01:50.836 --> 01:01:53.760
cabinets that are up. It's dark. There's no
lantern.

01:01:53.760 --> 01:01:55.419
LIAM: And what are the other doors?

01:01:55.419 --> 01:01:59.322
MATT: There's a door immediately to your left, and
there's, across the way, is an archway opening.

01:01:59.322 --> 01:02:03.435
There's no actual door there. It's just a walkway
that leads into the next room.

01:02:03.435 --> 01:02:04.903
LIAM: So it's open straight ahead?

01:02:04.903 --> 01:02:05.917
MATT: Yes.

01:02:05.917 --> 01:02:11.880
LIAM: I haven't used any movement. If I go to the
archway right across, right?

01:02:11.880 --> 01:02:12.856
MATT: Yep.

01:02:12.856 --> 01:02:19.860
LIAM: I'm clicking my boots as I walk forward. Do
I perception check again at the arch, or does the

01:02:19.860 --> 01:02:21.464
same one hold?

01:02:21.464 --> 01:02:24.830
MATT: As you glance through, you can see what
appears to be...

01:02:24.830 --> 01:02:29.864
LIAM: I unlocked the door and I've walked ten
feet.

01:02:29.864 --> 01:02:35.860
MATT: There appears to be a hallway. There's a
hallway that goes across the way. There's a door

01:02:35.860 --> 01:02:39.267
at the end of the hallway, and two doors to the
right and left of this hallway.

01:02:39.267 --> 01:02:42.119
LIAM: All right, I'm going to juke to the left.
I'm going to go to that door and try the knob.

01:02:42.119 --> 01:02:43.285
MATT: Right here?

01:02:43.285 --> 01:02:45.693
LIAM: Nope, no, the other door in the room I'm
in.

01:02:45.693 --> 01:02:46.523
MATT: Oh, over here?

01:02:46.523 --> 01:02:47.457
LIAM: Yeah.

01:02:47.457 --> 01:02:49.555
MATT: You go over there and you try it. (click) It
opens up.

01:02:49.555 --> 01:02:51.111
LIAM: (singing) Perception!

01:02:51.111 --> 01:02:55.968
MATT: Opens up into what appears to be a storage
room.

01:02:55.968 --> 01:02:57.046
LIAM: Nothing.

01:02:57.046 --> 01:03:00.914
MATT: Series of barrels, small grain sacks in the
far corner. It appears that most of the dry

01:03:00.914 --> 01:03:02.960
storage for the kitchen is kept in this room.

01:03:02.960 --> 01:03:06.044
LIAM: All right, so I look straight at Percival.

01:03:06.044 --> 01:03:09.965
TALIESIN: I'm going to go straight through the
hallway and try the door on the left.

01:03:09.965 --> 01:03:13.173
MATT: Okay. Move you forward to do that, you move
in.

01:03:13.173 --> 01:03:17.163
LIAM: I'd like to use the last of my movement just
to stay-- because I've got the boots on, I've got

01:03:17.163 --> 01:03:19.981
a lot of movement left; I can stay ten feet behind
him.

01:03:19.981 --> 01:03:23.734
MATT: You do. Okay. You stay behind him as you
move in. The door, this one here?

01:03:23.734 --> 01:03:26.522
TALIESIN: Yeah, move the one to the right. Yeah,
sure, that one.

01:03:26.522 --> 01:03:33.237
MATT: (shhh) You slide that one open. It appears
to be a bathtub in there. It's a rather nice

01:03:33.237 --> 01:03:36.067
powder room and bathroom.

01:03:36.067 --> 01:03:39.030
TALIESIN: There's no way to just quickly push the
other door open, too, is there?

01:03:39.030 --> 01:03:41.360
MATT: You can try. I'll say for this round, you
can go ahead and open that, look inside for a

01:03:41.360 --> 01:03:46.652
second, go for this, just really quick checking
back and forth. This one, this door actually, it

01:03:46.652 --> 01:03:49.574
does not appear to open at a push.

01:03:49.574 --> 01:03:52.553
TALIESIN: And I signal.

01:03:52.553 --> 01:03:54.867
LIAM: Can I, at this point?

01:03:54.867 --> 01:03:56.254
MATT: No, you've already done your move.

01:03:56.254 --> 01:03:57.585
LIAM: And we're on the first floor, right?

01:03:57.585 --> 01:03:59.292
MATT: Yes, you guys are on the base floor.

01:03:59.292 --> 01:04:02.032
TRAVIS: And they're all up on the second floor,
right?

01:04:02.032 --> 01:04:13.626
MATT: Right, that's your go. So. Bringing us to
Count Tylieri's turn. Count Tylieri, who is

01:04:13.626 --> 01:04:18.624
currently looking over the banister. He kind of
steps forward here for a second. Grog, this works

01:04:18.624 --> 01:04:25.479
for you because you look up and see all the guards
there. Tylieri walks up. This rotund-looking,

01:04:25.479 --> 01:04:34.096
slimy individual, thinning hair, very pale skin, a
little bit of facial hair that has never really

01:04:34.096 --> 01:04:36.467
seemed to grow fully in, but he tries to groom the
best he can.

01:04:36.467 --> 01:04:37.859
LAURA: Grog's beard is better than that.

01:04:37.859 --> 01:04:43.294
MATT: Oh, much better. He's wearing fine clothing.
He's got rings encrusting his fingers, but he

01:04:43.294 --> 01:04:50.454
walks with a deftness to the edge of this stairway
and looks over and says, "Interesting. I figured

01:04:50.454 --> 01:04:52.606
"there'd be more of you."

01:04:52.606 --> 01:04:55.167
TRAVIS: Interesting. There's a lot of dead men up
there.

01:04:55.167 --> 01:05:06.549
MATT: (laughs) Of which, you see him leap up onto
the ceiling, (pshh) stick to it. And begin to

01:05:06.549 --> 01:05:08.229
(skittering noise) scatter across.

01:05:08.229 --> 01:05:09.989
LAURA: The one with the shitty beard?

01:05:09.989 --> 01:05:10.855
MATT: Yep.

01:05:10.855 --> 01:05:11.714
MARISHA: Tylieri?

01:05:11.714 --> 01:05:12.578
MATT: Yep.

01:05:12.578 --> 01:05:13.664
SAM: He's Spider-man?

01:05:13.664 --> 01:05:22.221
MATT: He jumps up and spider-crawls across the
ceiling, and then drops down. Yeah. With deft

01:05:22.221 --> 01:05:27.786
acrobatic feats, he leaps across, drops and lands
right in front of you. You can see now in his

01:05:27.786 --> 01:05:32.655
face, as slovenly as it is, there is a look of
deathly hunger in his eyes, and fangs bared from

01:05:32.655 --> 01:05:33.760
under his lips.

01:05:33.760 --> 01:05:35.328
TRAVIS: That's a neat trick.

01:05:35.328 --> 01:05:42.058
MATT: He is now going to make two melee attacks
against you. That's a natural 20 with the claw,

01:05:42.058 --> 01:05:45.677
and the other one's going to be a 15? I don't
think it's going to hit.

01:05:45.677 --> 01:05:46.545
TRAVIS: No.

01:05:46.545 --> 01:05:50.433
MATT: So he now has these long claws in his hand.
The first one (whoosh). It catches you off guard

01:05:50.433 --> 01:05:53.228
from the sheer weird assault that he's brought to
you.

01:05:53.228 --> 01:05:55.058
TRAVIS: What's wrong with you?

01:05:55.058 --> 01:06:04.349
MATT: (laughs) You take 16 points of slashing
damage (whoosh) from the first arc, and he goes up

01:06:04.349 --> 01:06:09.070
with the second hand and this time you (grunt)
pull out of the way. His hand manages to knock

01:06:09.070 --> 01:06:11.462
some of the bolts free that were jammed in your
chest.

01:06:11.462 --> 01:06:12.849
TRAVIS: Half the 16, right?

01:06:12.849 --> 01:06:14.502
MATT: Half of 16, correct.

01:06:14.546 --> 01:06:15.695
TRAVIS: So, eight.

01:06:15.695 --> 01:06:19.635
MATT: Because you're raging, so eight on that one.
That's his go. And he just grins at you with this

01:06:19.635 --> 01:06:27.539
hissing sound, licking his fanged lips. That ends
his turn. That brings us to Grog. You're up.

01:06:27.539 --> 01:06:34.387
TRAVIS: (growls) I go into a frenzied rage and I
use reckless attack, along with my great weapon

01:06:34.387 --> 01:06:38.598
master, and I turn that thing into a piece of goo
with my war hammer.

01:06:38.598 --> 01:06:39.766
(laughter)

01:06:39.766 --> 01:06:44.041
MATT: Okay. War hammer (fwoosh) bursts into
flames. Your eyes all of a sudden go into an

01:06:44.041 --> 01:06:48.557
intense glare as you rear up and go into your
frenzied rage. Make your attacks. Do it.

01:06:48.557 --> 01:06:52.319
TRAVIS: Advantage on them. That's much better.
That's 24?

01:06:52.319 --> 01:06:56.299
MATT: 24 hits on the first strike. You only have
advantage on the first attack.

01:06:56.299 --> 01:06:58.475
TRAVIS: Oh, gotcha. Okay. Just the first one.

01:06:58.475 --> 01:07:00.273
MATT: Yeah, the first one's a reckless strike.

01:07:00.273 --> 01:07:01.547
TRAVIS: Okay. 21?

01:07:01.547 --> 01:07:02.842
MATT: Hits, as well.

01:07:02.842 --> 01:07:05.612
TRAVIS: And 20.

01:07:05.612 --> 01:07:06.825
MATT: All three hit.

01:07:06.825 --> 01:07:08.445
TRAVIS: Yes. Okay.

01:07:08.445 --> 01:07:10.525
MATT: That's with the minus five, right?

01:07:10.525 --> 01:07:13.878
MARISHA: Great weapon master?

01:07:13.878 --> 01:07:15.990
MATT: Because of great weapon master, it would be
minus five to each attack.

01:07:15.990 --> 01:07:17.316
TRAVIS: No.

01:07:17.316 --> 01:07:18.924
MATT: All right, so the last one was 15?

01:07:18.924 --> 01:07:19.917
TRAVIS: Yes.

01:07:19.917 --> 01:07:20.994
MATT: Last one misses.

01:07:20.994 --> 01:07:21.777
TRAVIS: Okay.

01:07:21.777 --> 01:07:23.055
MATT: But the first two do hit.

01:07:23.055 --> 01:07:25.936
TRAVIS: Okay. I forgot that part. Know your rules,
kids.

01:07:25.936 --> 01:07:30.323
LAURA: Then you add a ten to all of them?

01:07:30.323 --> 01:07:33.861
TRAVIS: 21 for the first one.

01:07:33.861 --> 01:07:34.907
MATT: 21 points of damage.

01:07:34.907 --> 01:07:40.161
TRAVIS: And 20 for the second one, and the third
one misses, right?

01:07:40.208 --> 01:07:41.405
MATT: That's with the fire, right?

01:07:41.543 --> 01:07:42.555
TRAVIS: That's with the fire.

01:07:42.555 --> 01:07:46.636
MATT: Yeah. Third one misses, so 41 points of
damage to him with the first two, (whack, whack),

01:07:46.636 --> 01:07:51.153
the impacts slamming into him. You can see his
body get pushed back with each impact. He's still

01:07:51.153 --> 01:07:54.242
taking it and grinning at you, but he's also
seemingly surprised by the ferocity of the

01:07:54.242 --> 01:07:57.681
strikes. Is that your turn? Are you going to
move?

01:07:57.681 --> 01:08:00.775
TRAVIS: That's it. No, I'm not going to move.

01:08:00.775 --> 01:08:06.923
MATT: Okay. He's going to use one of his legendary
actions to, at the end of your turn, reach out and

01:08:06.923 --> 01:08:10.928
attack you again. That's going to be a 23 to hit?

01:08:10.928 --> 01:08:12.039
TRAVIS: Yep.

01:08:12.039 --> 01:08:16.020
MATT: Instead of attacking, he's going to grapple
you.

01:08:16.020 --> 01:08:17.090
TRAVIS: Okay.

01:08:17.090 --> 01:08:20.854
MATT: So his claw goes up and actually (fwoosh)
reaches into your throat, and you can feel the

01:08:20.854 --> 01:08:25.167
claws digging into the flesh. It's a very, very
firm grip and he has you right where he wants you.

01:08:25.167 --> 01:08:27.426
TRAVIS: Work that hand out a lot, do you?

01:08:27.426 --> 01:08:35.525
MATT: That's that action there. All right, that
brings us to the guards. The guards all reload

01:08:35.525 --> 01:08:40.844
their crossbow bolts, move in. These three now see
the bear in the back and they're going to fire on

01:08:40.844 --> 01:08:45.437
Trinket. These seven are all going to fire on
Grog, now that he's held there. So the three

01:08:45.437 --> 01:08:48.277
against Trinket. That's going to be a 16?

01:08:48.277 --> 01:08:49.549
LAURA: Doesn't hit!

01:08:49.549 --> 01:08:52.106
MATT: That's going to be a 20?

01:08:52.106 --> 01:08:53.070
LAURA: Hits.

01:08:53.070 --> 01:08:54.606
MATT: And a 22.

01:08:54.606 --> 01:08:55.822
LAURA: Yeah.

01:08:55.822 --> 01:09:01.926
MATT: So Trinket takes six points of piercing
damage and 11 points of piercing damage. Total of

01:09:01.926 --> 01:09:06.297
17 points of damage to Trinket as two bolts
(shink, shink). One of them bounces off the armor.

01:09:06.297 --> 01:09:09.986
One actually sticks and Trinket, (growls) but it's
not enough to really cause much of a worry.

01:09:09.986 --> 01:09:11.307
LAURA: Yeah, he doesn't care.

01:09:11.307 --> 01:09:21.979
MATT: The other seven against you, Grog. Natural
20. Natural one. That's not going to hit, that's a

01:09:21.979 --> 01:09:24.401
natural five. 18?

01:09:24.401 --> 01:09:26.001
TRAVIS: Misses.

01:09:26.001 --> 01:09:39.124
MATT: Natural one. That's a 19, that hits. A 19
naturally, so it's 27. One more. That's 18 to hit.

01:09:39.124 --> 01:09:40.502
TRAVIS: Misses.

01:09:40.502 --> 01:09:42.511
MATT: Oh, these all have advantage on you because
you did a reckless attack.

01:09:42.511 --> 01:09:43.821
TRAVIS: That's right, I did.

01:09:43.821 --> 01:09:45.511
MATT: So the one that would have missed is a
natural 20.

01:09:45.511 --> 01:09:46.891
TRAVIS: Nay!

01:09:46.891 --> 01:09:50.766
MATT: That does hit. Natural 20 again.

01:09:50.766 --> 01:09:51.987
MARISHA: What?

01:09:51.987 --> 01:09:54.326
MATT: I'm rolling for all the ones that would have
missed.

01:09:54.326 --> 01:09:55.952
SAM: Why do they have advantage on you?

01:09:55.952 --> 01:09:57.694
TRAVIS: Because I had advantage on mine.

01:09:57.694 --> 01:09:59.043
MATT: Yeah. Reckless attack.

01:09:59.043 --> 01:10:00.384
SAM: That's reckless!

01:10:00.384 --> 01:10:02.354
TRAVIS: (laughs) It is very reckless.

01:10:02.354 --> 01:10:04.259
MATT: They all hit you, three of which are crits.

01:10:04.259 --> 01:10:05.260
TRAVIS: (sarcastically) Yay!

01:10:05.260 --> 01:10:06.670
MARISHA: Son of a bitch.

01:10:06.670 --> 01:10:10.389
MATT: First crit is 19 points of piercing damage.

01:10:10.389 --> 01:10:12.080
LIAM: (flatly) Merry Critmas.

01:10:12.080 --> 01:10:14.085
LAURA: We're all going to die.

01:10:14.085 --> 01:10:17.185
MATT: The second crit is going to be nine points
of piercing damage.

01:10:17.185 --> 01:10:18.417
TRAVIS: Okay.

01:10:18.417 --> 01:10:21.653
MATT: Last one is going to be another nine points
of piercing damage.

01:10:21.653 --> 01:10:23.916
TRAVIS: Okay, 37 halved.

01:10:23.916 --> 01:10:27.731
MATT: Actually, that would be 15 total because
that was a crit. So the three crits are out of the way.

01:10:27.731 --> 01:10:31.394
TRAVIS: Okay. 37. So, 15 total?

01:10:31.394 --> 01:10:33.629
MATT: 15 on the last one, yeah.

01:10:33.629 --> 01:10:34.702
TRAVIS: Okay.

01:10:34.702 --> 01:10:36.709
MATT: And so those are the three crits.

01:10:36.709 --> 01:10:39.802
TRAVIS: 33. What's half of 33?

01:10:39.802 --> 01:10:41.613
LAURA: 16.

01:10:41.613 --> 01:10:43.356
LIAM: 16 or 17. 16.

01:10:43.356 --> 01:10:53.486
MATT: There you go, so that's that. And the next
ones are 11. Another 11.

01:10:53.486 --> 01:10:56.164
TALIESIN: We're going to have to thin these ranks
out quickly.

01:10:56.164 --> 01:11:04.948
MATT: Ten. And seven. So you take another 39
points of piercing damage after that.

01:11:04.948 --> 01:11:10.019
TRAVIS: Okay, I'm going to use my stone's
endurance to get rid of that stank.

01:11:10.019 --> 01:11:12.058
MATT: One of them, yeah.

01:11:12.058 --> 01:11:17.208
TRAVIS: Roll, plus my constitution. 16.

01:11:17.208 --> 01:11:25.633
MATT: Okay, so we'll say you reduce one of the
crits from 16. The first one, take 15 points off

01:11:25.633 --> 01:11:29.255
that because I think one of the crits was 15.
We'll say you used it on that one. That's 39

01:11:29.255 --> 01:11:33.636
points of piercing damage, reduced by half. That
will put you at 18.

01:11:33.636 --> 01:11:35.148
TRAVIS: 18? Okay.

01:11:35.148 --> 01:11:38.402
MATT: We'll say you take 18 points of piercing
damage from those four non-crits.

01:11:38.402 --> 01:11:39.553
TRAVIS: Okay.

01:11:39.553 --> 01:11:45.270
MATT: So yeah. That ends the guards' volley. That
brings us to Vex. You're up.

01:11:45.270 --> 01:11:47.001
LAURA: Me? And Trinket.

01:11:47.001 --> 01:11:48.392
MATT: Yes. And Trinket. Both.

01:11:48.392 --> 01:11:51.245
LAURA: Okay, so I run in after Percy and my
brother.

01:11:51.245 --> 01:11:52.228
MATT: Okay.

01:11:52.228 --> 01:11:58.149
LAURA: And Trinket--

01:11:58.149 --> 01:12:02.890
MATT: Are you going to dash? Because you can move,
you can double move, using your action to move, if

01:12:02.890 --> 01:12:03.823
you want.

01:12:03.823 --> 01:12:05.119
LAURA: Oh, I can?

01:12:05.119 --> 01:12:09.813
MATT: Yeah. Unless you want to use your action to
yell out for Trinket to attack, in which case, you

01:12:09.813 --> 01:12:11.124
can give Trinket a round of combat.

01:12:11.124 --> 01:12:12.794
LAURA: Oh, I do want to give Trinket a round of
combat, so yes.

01:12:12.794 --> 01:12:14.073
MATT: Okay.

01:12:14.073 --> 01:12:18.295
LAURA: And he gets a couple of attacks if I don't
attack at all, right?

01:12:18.295 --> 01:12:19.859
MATT: Correct. Yep.

01:12:19.859 --> 01:12:25.809
LAURA: So that's good. (screams) Okay, Trinket
gets two attacks because of bestial fury.

01:12:25.809 --> 01:12:26.625
MATT: Correct.

01:12:26.625 --> 01:12:27.904
LIAM: He hears your voice!

01:12:27.904 --> 01:12:33.414
LAURA: Because he hears my voice. So he's going to
run around and he's going to try to knock over--

01:12:33.414 --> 01:12:37.078
he's going to cannonball into the vampire guy.

01:12:37.078 --> 01:12:39.818
MATT: Okay, so he's going to move this way and
then cannonball forward?

01:12:39.818 --> 01:12:40.739
LAURA: Yeah.

01:12:40.739 --> 01:12:43.933
MATT: Okay. Trinket moves off to the side.
(thudding footsteps) Gets a couple of running

01:12:43.933 --> 01:12:49.096
starts, and then rolls into a roly-poly style
forward. All right, so make one attack against him.

01:12:49.096 --> 01:12:53.829
LAURA: Okay. Okay. What do I add to that?

01:12:53.829 --> 01:12:56.477
MATT: Your attack bonus for Trinket.

01:12:56.477 --> 01:13:01.559
LIAM: I don't know, for your bear. AC, HP, bite
attack, claw attack, plus eight.

01:13:01.559 --> 01:13:03.978
MATT: Yes, plus eight just for the attack.

01:13:03.978 --> 01:13:05.276
LAURA: Okay, 15?

01:13:05.276 --> 01:13:10.164
MATT: 15 does not hit, unfortunately. So Trinket
rolls past. He dodges out of the way, gets an

01:13:10.164 --> 01:13:16.845
attack of opportunity on him because he wasn't hit
as part of the attack. That's a 27 to hit. Trinket

01:13:16.845 --> 01:13:24.938
takes seven plus three, ten points of slashing
damage as he streaks by. Seeing the bear coming at

01:13:24.938 --> 01:13:28.077
him too soon and managing to both pull out of the
way and use that to his advantage.

01:13:28.077 --> 01:13:33.075
TALIESIN: I'm going to be playing rule Nazi
tonight. Is that attack of opportunity possible

01:13:33.075 --> 01:13:35.129
since he's grappling somebody?

01:13:35.129 --> 01:13:40.015
MATT: Technically, yes. He's just grappling with
one hand and just dodges out of the way, moves

01:13:40.015 --> 01:13:41.679
over and slashes with the other hand.

01:13:41.679 --> 01:13:43.034
TALIESIN: Trying everything I can to save this
bear.

01:13:43.034 --> 01:13:44.483
MATT: I know you, man. It's okay.

01:13:44.483 --> 01:13:46.020
(laughter)

01:13:46.020 --> 01:13:53.444
LAURA: Trinket then comes out of cannonball and
tries to bite the back of the vampire's neck.

01:13:53.480 --> 01:13:56.711
MATT: Okay. I'll let you do that because this is
your full round to do that. Usually you would

01:13:56.711 --> 01:13:57.864
choose to cannonball--

01:13:57.864 --> 01:13:59.577
LAURA: Or I do my two attacks?

01:13:59.577 --> 01:14:02.477
MATT: But because you aren't part of this combat
fray and you're giving all of your round to him,

01:14:02.477 --> 01:14:03.587
I'll let you do it, sure.

01:14:03.587 --> 01:14:04.577
LAURA: Okay. Thank you.

01:14:04.577 --> 01:14:08.418
MATT: Trinket comes out of the roll, turns around
(roars) and strikes with the claw, swiping--

01:14:08.418 --> 01:14:10.447
LAURA: He's trying to bite his neck like a
vampire!

01:14:10.447 --> 01:14:11.931
MATT: Oh, bite him? Okay.

01:14:11.931 --> 01:14:14.665
LAURA: Oh, shit. Ooh! That's good. 27.

01:14:14.665 --> 01:14:15.571
MATT: That hits.

01:14:15.571 --> 01:14:18.099
LIAM: Split his head like a gourd.

01:14:18.099 --> 01:14:21.144
LAURA: 11.

01:14:21.144 --> 01:14:26.658
MATT: 11 points of damage as Trinket latches onto
the back of his shoulder (growls) and pulls and

01:14:26.658 --> 01:14:30.760
tugs at him, trying to get him loose from Grog's
grip. Not strong enough to do so, but he

01:14:30.760 --> 01:14:37.096
nevertheless takes the damage and (snarls) hisses
back at the bear clutched onto his shoulder. Cool.

01:14:37.096 --> 01:14:39.216
That ends your turn. Keyleth, you're up.

01:14:39.216 --> 01:14:45.795
MARISHA: Okay, can I see the smoke from the fire
rising up from what Scanlan did on the other

01:14:45.795 --> 01:14:46.990
house?

01:14:46.990 --> 01:14:52.403
MATT: At this point? Make a perception check. It's
a heavy storm.

01:14:52.403 --> 01:14:54.621
MARISHA: That's not great. 12?

01:14:54.621 --> 01:15:00.660
MATT: 12? Currently, in the storm, you're just not
able to really make up any visual in the distance

01:15:00.660 --> 01:15:04.822
right now, no. You do not know if there is any
fire going on or any signal, at this point.

01:15:04.899 --> 01:15:14.686
MARISHA: Okay. Shit. Are there any other windows
along the back side of the house?

01:15:14.686 --> 01:15:17.188
MATT: Over here? Yeah, there's a window there,
window there, window there.

01:15:17.188 --> 01:15:18.403
MARISHA: Through the side.

01:15:18.403 --> 01:15:21.615
MATT: Oh, back here? This side, there are no other
windows. It is completely closed off.

01:15:21.615 --> 01:15:24.225
MARISHA: No other windows?

01:15:24.225 --> 01:15:28.008
MATT: Nope, there's just the one entry there that
everyone else went in through.

01:15:28.008 --> 01:15:39.634
MARISHA: Shit. Okay, I'll go inside.

01:15:39.634 --> 01:15:43.982
SAM: Hello, is there anyone in here?

01:15:43.982 --> 01:15:48.255
MARISHA: Is there anything in this direction? This
way? Can we not get this way?

01:15:48.255 --> 01:15:54.471
MATT: This is a storage closet that was already
checked by Vax, who walked past it.

01:15:54.471 --> 01:15:57.552
MARISHA: Do we know if there are any outside doors
over here on this side?

01:15:57.552 --> 01:16:00.166
MATT: You don't, no. No one's moved all the way in
to see, and it's not very well-lit in there,

01:16:00.166 --> 01:16:01.617
currently.

01:16:01.617 --> 01:16:06.137
MARISHA: Could I have gone around the edge here to
see? Would we have known, going on this side, if

01:16:06.137 --> 01:16:07.182
there were any doors?

01:16:07.182 --> 01:16:10.391
MATT: No, because you guys approached from that
side. You saw windows, but it was fairly dark. You

01:16:10.391 --> 01:16:14.627
saw a little bit of light moving through some of
the windows on the second story, but nothing down

01:16:14.775 --> 01:16:16.761
here that really caught your attention.

01:16:16.761 --> 01:16:19.246
MARISHA: And we still have no way into this main
room, either, yet?

01:16:19.246 --> 01:16:22.161
MATT: Not yet. There is a door at the end of this
hallway, but nobody's gotten to try it yet.

01:16:22.161 --> 01:16:24.704
TRAVIS: Could you get to a second-floor window?

01:16:24.704 --> 01:16:27.727
MATT: You could push past your party and continue
to move down the hallway, if you want.

01:16:27.727 --> 01:16:30.940
LAURA: Second floor's better than first floor,
anyway.

01:16:30.940 --> 01:16:33.504
MARISHA: Okay. I'm sorry. I'm an asshole.

01:16:33.504 --> 01:16:36.345
SAM: You turn into an asshole.

01:16:36.345 --> 01:16:43.592
MARISHA: (giggling) I turn into an asshole. Were
there any-- fuck, I really don't want to have to

01:16:43.592 --> 01:16:46.174
blow-- okay, so I'm going to---

01:16:46.174 --> 01:16:47.858
MATT: What are you going to do?

01:16:47.858 --> 01:16:50.391
MARISHA: Yeah, you know what? I didn't go inside.
I'm outside.

01:16:50.391 --> 01:16:53.106
MATT: You came inside. Not going to retcon it.

01:16:53.106 --> 01:16:55.244
MARISHA: Dick. All right.

01:16:55.244 --> 01:16:57.921
MATT: I'm just saying! You can't get halfway in
there and be like, "Wait, this didn't happen."

01:16:57.921 --> 01:17:00.234
MARISHA: Okay.

01:17:00.234 --> 01:17:03.291
LIAM: Technically, none of this happened.

01:17:03.291 --> 01:17:06.404
TALIESIN: Thank you for coming with me on that
journey.

01:17:06.404 --> 01:17:15.311
MARISHA: Fine, I'll just see if this fucking door
is open. That's all I can do right now.

01:17:15.311 --> 01:17:16.871
MATT: The one across the way?

01:17:16.871 --> 01:17:17.764
MARISHA: Yeah.

01:17:17.764 --> 01:17:18.565
MATT: Okay.

01:17:18.565 --> 01:17:20.271
MARISHA: Sorry, guys, excuse me. Sorry, excuse
me.

01:17:20.271 --> 01:17:24.451
MATT: You push past everyone. You push on the
door. It opens up and reveals a long dining room,

01:17:24.451 --> 01:17:30.748
a big, thick dining room table, a double window
across the way. This is the house's dining room.

01:17:30.748 --> 01:17:34.715
There are two double doors across the way that
lead into what you think is the foyer, in which

01:17:34.715 --> 01:17:39.434
Grog and Trinket currently stormed through. And
you can hear, muffled through the door in the

01:17:39.434 --> 01:17:42.724
distance, the sound of combat and impact and
people shouting to each other.

01:17:42.724 --> 01:17:49.506
MARISHA: Okay, can I cross over to that window and
look out the front window? The window over here?

01:17:49.506 --> 01:17:54.878
MATT: I'll say you can get that far, and you can
just crest and look out the window if you want to.

01:17:54.878 --> 01:17:57.186
MARISHA: Do I see any fire from Scanlan?

01:17:57.186 --> 01:18:02.195
MATT: From this point, you've already checked
once. You're just getting in there. You won't be

01:18:02.195 --> 01:18:03.785
able to really see from here.

01:18:03.785 --> 01:18:04.972
MARISHA: That's my turn.

01:18:04.972 --> 01:18:07.420
MATT: That brings us to the top. Percy, you're
up.

01:18:07.420 --> 01:18:12.055
MARISHA: Oh, yeah. Can I call him? Can I,
(whispering) "Scanlan. Scanlan!"

01:18:12.055 --> 01:18:17.565
MATT: You make a little bit of a calling noise.
You hear nothing back. You fear you might be just

01:18:17.565 --> 01:18:18.881
out of range for it.

01:18:18.881 --> 01:18:20.764
MARISHA: Son of a bitch. All right.

01:18:20.764 --> 01:18:22.723
TALIESIN: I'm going to make a run for the door.

01:18:22.723 --> 01:18:29.854
MATT: Okay. You can get to there. You're just at
the edge of it. Do you want to try and knock it

01:18:29.854 --> 01:18:31.386
open?

01:18:31.386 --> 01:18:34.701
TALIESIN: Is it open? Can I open the door?

01:18:34.701 --> 01:18:39.479
MATT: You can try to. You reach out. (creak) It
opens up and you can see now, a light comes

01:18:39.479 --> 01:18:43.487
pouring through from the foyer, and you can hear
much louder now, the sound of combat, and Grog

01:18:43.487 --> 01:18:47.396
chuckling, and swings and impacts. You can see a
couple of crossbow bolts go (boof)

01:18:47.444 --> 01:18:49.632
and scatter across the ground.

01:18:49.775 --> 01:18:53.100
TALIESIN: I would have to use my action to move?

01:18:53.100 --> 01:18:54.468
MATT: Correct.

01:18:54.468 --> 01:19:03.711
TALIESIN: You know... (sighs) Yeah, this is going
to be worthwhile. I'm going to-- well...

01:19:03.711 --> 01:19:05.037
(laughter)

01:19:05.037 --> 01:19:06.034
MATT: What are you doing?

01:19:06.034 --> 01:19:07.009
TALIESIN: I hate you.

01:19:07.009 --> 01:19:08.166
MATT: What are you doing?

01:19:08.166 --> 01:19:09.321
SAM: Kill things.

01:19:09.321 --> 01:19:10.678
MARISHA: Shoot out the window.

01:19:10.678 --> 01:19:12.249
TALIESIN: Shoot out the window?

01:19:12.249 --> 01:19:15.553
LAURA: Just act on the fly like Scanlan did. It
turned out okay.

01:19:15.553 --> 01:19:18.528
MATT: Do your thing, Percy. Do your thing. What
are you doing?

01:19:18.528 --> 01:19:23.866
TALIESIN: Okay, I'm going to be helpful. I'm going
to burn my action to get into the room.

01:19:23.866 --> 01:19:25.342
MATT: Okay. Where do you want to get on this
side?

01:19:25.342 --> 01:19:26.153
TALIESIN: Right there.

01:19:26.153 --> 01:19:27.073
MATT: Right there?

01:19:27.073 --> 01:19:28.512
TALIESIN: Yeah, I want to stand right there.

01:19:28.512 --> 01:19:31.550
MATT: Okay, so you just swing around (fwwwt) to
the inside. You look up and immediately you see

01:19:31.550 --> 01:19:35.698
this curved banister and a whole row of guards up
top with heavy crossbows. In the center, you can

01:19:35.698 --> 01:19:42.313
see some blur as Grog, Trinket, and some
individual are in the middle of this tussle. The

01:19:42.313 --> 01:19:47.637
individual currently has Grog grasped by the
throat.

01:19:47.637 --> 01:19:57.344
TALIESIN: How crazy-- I don't know if I can do
Minor Illusion that way right now. So I'm going to

01:19:57.344 --> 01:20:00.858
call Hex on that first guard there.

01:20:00.858 --> 01:20:02.929
MATT: Which one? Right there?

01:20:02.929 --> 01:20:03.912
TALIESIN: Yep.

01:20:03.912 --> 01:20:04.738
MATT: Okay.

01:20:04.738 --> 01:20:11.682
TALIESIN: I'm going to burn my action surge, and
I'm going to start taking my shots, and I'm just

01:20:11.682 --> 01:20:13.228
going to work my way up.

01:20:13.228 --> 01:20:16.390
MATT: Okay, so you swing around the corner and
look up at the one guard. As you concentrate for a

01:20:16.390 --> 01:20:20.041
second, bringing your gun up, your eyes begin to
go black again, the smoke pouring out from the

01:20:20.041 --> 01:20:23.367
corner of it. Smoke begins to pour out of the
midsection of the guard, who looks confused for a

01:20:23.411 --> 01:20:29.030
second, and it swirls around him as part of the
Hex that has him marked, as you release your next

01:20:29.030 --> 01:20:30.516
three blasts.

01:20:30.516 --> 01:20:33.225
TALIESIN: Okay. This is with sharpshooter.

01:20:33.225 --> 01:20:34.464
MATT: Okay.

01:20:34.464 --> 01:20:40.437
TALIESIN: That sucks. Ten?

01:20:40.437 --> 01:20:46.621
MATT: Ten misses. First shot just (ricochet noise)
goes wide, blasting a chunk out of the upstairs

01:20:46.621 --> 01:20:48.879
hallway.

01:20:48.879 --> 01:20:50.878
TALIESIN: 11.

01:20:50.878 --> 01:20:55.442
MATT: 11 also goes wide. This time (ricochet
noise) blasting part of the banister in front. The

01:20:55.442 --> 01:20:58.564
guard dodges out of the way as the wood splinters
past him.

01:20:58.564 --> 01:21:00.215
TALIESIN: Natural 20.

01:21:00.215 --> 01:21:01.628
MARISHA: That's better!

01:21:01.628 --> 01:21:04.278
MATT: That's the Percy we know. (laughs)

01:21:04.278 --> 01:21:10.400
TALIESIN: And so since that was a third shot, it
was also a bonus shot, so that's got an extra--

01:21:10.400 --> 01:21:13.206
okay! Does that mean that everything gets
doubled?

01:21:13.206 --> 01:21:15.431
MATT: All dice gets doubled, and then you add the
modifier.

01:21:15.431 --> 01:21:16.754
TALIESIN: Not the modifier, though?

01:21:16.754 --> 01:21:18.379
MATT: Not the modifier, no.

01:21:18.379 --> 01:21:19.521
TALIESIN: Modifier stays the same.

01:21:19.521 --> 01:21:20.481
MATT: Correct.

01:21:20.481 --> 01:21:23.729
TALIESIN: Roll twice, or just double my die?

01:21:23.729 --> 01:21:25.812
MATT: Double the die. It's faster.

01:21:25.812 --> 01:21:32.466
TALIESIN: Okay, so that's-- I should have just
used my--

01:21:32.514 --> 01:21:34.293
SAM: What device?

01:21:34.293 --> 01:21:36.153
TALIESIN: I know! I should have just used it.

01:21:36.153 --> 01:21:37.660
MARISHA: That's not bad, though.

01:21:37.660 --> 01:21:46.929
TALIESIN: Nine, 13, 26. 42 points of damage.

01:21:46.929 --> 01:21:49.512
MATT: 42 points of damage?

01:21:49.512 --> 01:21:51.561
TALIESIN: And four of that was fire damage.

01:21:51.561 --> 01:21:56.376
MATT: And four of that was fire damage? Okay. As
you look up, (doosh) the first two shots fire and

01:21:56.376 --> 01:22:00.487
go wide. The third one, (explosion noise) just
explodes and in a blast of black smoke, the

01:22:00.487 --> 01:22:02.725
guard's head is no longer across his shoulders.

01:22:02.725 --> 01:22:04.428
(cheering)

01:22:04.428 --> 01:22:12.258
TALIESIN: Okay, I move the black cloud to the next
guard. He also gains disadvantage on all-- let's

01:22:12.258 --> 01:22:14.558
make it dexterity saving throws.

01:22:14.558 --> 01:22:16.207
MATT: Ability checks.

01:22:16.207 --> 01:22:18.146
TALIESIN: Ability checks, yeah, so all dex
checks.

01:22:18.146 --> 01:22:22.811
MATT: So the smoke (whoosh) pours off the body and
coalesces around the next guard to his right. All

01:22:22.811 --> 01:22:24.019
right, that ends your turn.

01:22:24.019 --> 01:22:25.772
TALIESIN: That's the end of my turn.

01:22:25.772 --> 01:22:26.703
MATT: Vax.

01:22:26.703 --> 01:22:30.764
LIAM: All right, I've got double speed. I go right
towards the table, make an acrobatics check to

01:22:30.764 --> 01:22:32.673
slide my ass across it--

01:22:32.673 --> 01:22:34.106
SAM: Are you doing what I did?

01:22:34.106 --> 01:22:35.520
MATT: Do an acrobatics check.

01:22:35.520 --> 01:22:37.079
MARISHA: Yes! Dukes of Hazzard!

01:22:37.079 --> 01:22:40.148
LIAM: Yeah. That is a 23?

01:22:40.148 --> 01:22:41.957
MATT: You (shhht) slide to there.

01:22:41.957 --> 01:22:43.510
SAM: You did it so much cooler than me!

01:22:43.510 --> 01:22:44.546
(laughter)

01:22:44.546 --> 01:22:47.341
LIAM: I want to slide into a crouch right behind--
I don't want to go that far. Right by Percy,

01:22:47.341 --> 01:22:49.824
because I can't go much further, I don't think.

01:22:49.824 --> 01:22:51.078
MATT: At double movement?

01:22:51.113 --> 01:22:55.806
LIAM: Would I be able to make it to Grog and his
friend?

01:22:55.806 --> 01:22:58.963
If I can't make it to Grog, I want to stay
at the door. If I can make it to Grog, I want to

01:22:59.074 --> 01:22:59.970
go to Grog.

01:22:59.970 --> 01:23:02.904
MATT: Slide will give you movement. Yeah, you can
get next to him.

01:23:02.904 --> 01:23:07.208
LIAM: I don't want to go next to him, I want to go
and eviscerate the bowels of the fucker who's

01:23:07.208 --> 01:23:08.374
fucking with him.

01:23:08.374 --> 01:23:09.214
MATT: Okay, so right there?

01:23:09.214 --> 01:23:10.037
LIAM: Yeah.

01:23:10.037 --> 01:23:11.046
MATT: Okay. Yeah, you can get up there.

01:23:11.046 --> 01:23:12.475
LIAM: Sneak attack because he's engaged with
Grog.

01:23:12.475 --> 01:23:13.252
MATT: Correct.

01:23:13.252 --> 01:23:14.233
LIAM: So here comes the total.

01:23:14.233 --> 01:23:22.798
MARISHA: As he slides over the table in front of
me, I go, "That was pretty awesome. Bye. Good luck."

01:23:22.798 --> 01:23:24.615
LIAM: All right, so...

01:23:24.615 --> 01:23:25.760
SAM: You need some daggers?

01:23:25.760 --> 01:23:26.803
LIAM: No.

01:23:26.803 --> 01:23:28.003
MATT: More daggers!

01:23:28.003 --> 01:23:33.387
LIAM: Wait. So. I'm alive! Rogue rules--

01:23:33.387 --> 01:23:34.578
MATT: Whatcha doing?

01:23:34.578 --> 01:23:35.706
LAURA: What are you doing?

01:23:35.706 --> 01:23:39.406
LIAM: Oh, I'm stabbing the guy three times! I'm
doing my catchphrase, man. Dagger, dagger, dagger!

01:23:39.406 --> 01:23:45.871
Oh, he's already taken a turn in combat, okay. So.
I'm going to use luck on that first attack and go

01:23:45.871 --> 01:23:52.623
again-- ooh, and I'll use the first one. So the
first one was an 8 plus... 19 on the first?

01:23:52.623 --> 01:23:53.779
MATT: 19 hits.

01:23:53.779 --> 01:23:56.610
LIAM: All right. Second is a 19?

01:23:56.610 --> 01:23:57.929
MATT: Hits.

01:23:57.929 --> 01:24:00.166
LIAM: Third is 23.

01:24:00.166 --> 01:24:03.568
MATT: All three hit. Go ahead and roll damage.
Sneak attack on the first one.

01:24:03.568 --> 01:24:12.312
LIAM: All right, first one, I'm going to use my
Flametongue. It's two plus... nine. And here comes

01:24:12.312 --> 01:24:24.307
the juice. Nine, 13, 17, 18, 20, 23, 25? That's
the first one, and then second attack is three.

01:24:24.307 --> 01:24:34.776
This is the keen dagger, that's a ten. And the
third attack is the Flametongue again for seven.

01:24:34.776 --> 01:24:42.545
MATT: Seven. Okay, gotcha. So you (fwoosh) dart in
a blur of darkness. You come swinging up. You can

01:24:42.545 --> 01:24:46.334
see Tylieri is currently grasping Grog. Out of the
corner of his eye, just sees the movement and

01:24:46.334 --> 01:24:50.729
looks over curiously as the blade is immediately
in his side. (pained scream) And now you can see

01:24:50.729 --> 01:24:55.947
the jowls shake from the impact of the dagger
blow, and he looks down angrily at you, fangs

01:24:55.947 --> 01:24:58.621
bared as the two other attacks hit his side.

01:24:58.621 --> 01:25:00.621
LIAM: Yeah, I'm looking him right in the eye as I
do that, too.

01:25:00.621 --> 01:25:03.583
MATT: At the end of your turn, he uses two of his
legendary actions--

01:25:03.583 --> 01:25:06.193
LIAM: I'm wearing my helmet, my shiny helmet.

01:25:06.193 --> 01:25:10.978
MATT: I know. To look at you, reach up with the
throat that he's grasped, and sink his fangs

01:25:10.978 --> 01:25:13.603
directly into your throat, Grog.

01:25:13.603 --> 01:25:15.718
TRAVIS: (angry noise) I have a little collar. Does
that help at all?

01:25:15.718 --> 01:25:21.982
MATT: Not in this moment. You have a big neck.
Very big neck, and a very tiny collar. (laughs)

01:25:21.982 --> 01:25:24.775
That will be a 20 to hit?

01:25:24.775 --> 01:25:25.955
TRAVIS: Yep.

01:25:25.955 --> 01:25:31.594
MATT: All righty. So you take nine points of
piercing damage.

01:25:31.594 --> 01:25:32.821
TRAVIS: Is that halved?

01:25:32.821 --> 01:25:36.183
MATT: That is halved. Yeah. So say five, round up.

01:25:36.217 --> 01:25:37.328
TRAVIS: Sure.

01:25:37.328 --> 01:25:47.609
MATT: However, you do take 14 points of necrotic
damage. That is not reduced. But your maximum hit

01:25:47.609 --> 01:25:50.178
points are now reduced by 14.

01:25:50.178 --> 01:25:51.858
TRAVIS: Got it.

01:25:51.858 --> 01:25:55.585
MATT: As you feel that same similar cold feeling
as the life blood's being drained out of your body

01:25:55.585 --> 01:26:00.609
and you see his eyes cresting at you with this
wild glare. That ends your turn, Vax?

01:26:00.609 --> 01:26:02.104
LIAM: Yeah, that's it.

01:26:02.104 --> 01:26:03.989
MATT: It is now his turn.

01:26:03.989 --> 01:26:05.391
SAM: Spider-man?

01:26:05.391 --> 01:26:10.115
MATT: Yeah, now he's taking his turn. He's now
going to go ahead and make another bite attack on

01:26:10.115 --> 01:26:14.316
you again. As he pulls back and reaches his
forearm and grabs the other side of your throat,

01:26:14.316 --> 01:26:15.832
going for the other side of the jugular.

01:26:15.832 --> 01:26:17.182
TRAVIS: Isn't this a Grog buffet?

01:26:17.182 --> 01:26:18.381
MATT: That's a natural one, though.

01:26:18.381 --> 01:26:19.818
(cheering)

01:26:19.818 --> 01:26:22.139
SAM: Oh, because you've got your necklace on.

01:26:22.139 --> 01:26:26.426
MATT: However, he does have advantage on you
because you used your reckless strike.

01:26:26.426 --> 01:26:29.025
SAM: Never use reckless strike again.

01:26:29.025 --> 01:26:35.036
LIAM: Doesn't it cancel out after one roll?
Advantage versus disadvantage is one roll, right?

01:26:35.036 --> 01:26:36.825
TRAVIS: It ended on the first attack, right?

01:26:36.825 --> 01:26:39.870
MATT: It was a one on the first attack, yeah. It's
until your next turn. Attacks against you get

01:26:39.870 --> 01:26:41.105
advantage.

01:26:41.105 --> 01:26:42.413
TRAVIS: Oh, I thought his first bite was the first
one.

01:26:42.413 --> 01:26:45.992
SAM: Wait, so all attacks, even follow-up attacks
get advantage, even though he only gets advantage

01:26:45.992 --> 01:26:46.972
on the first one?

01:26:46.972 --> 01:26:50.196
MATT: I'll read it for you right now. It's a cool
ability when you're not the only tank in the room.

01:26:50.196 --> 01:26:52.773
SAM: No, it is not! It's the worst ability ever.

01:26:52.773 --> 01:26:55.012
LAURA: It's a good ability if you're only fighting
one person.

01:26:55.012 --> 01:26:59.121
MATT: Yeah, but attack rolls against you have
advantage until your next turn.

01:26:59.121 --> 01:27:01.024
LIAM: Because he's out of it. He's going cuckoo.

01:27:01.024 --> 01:27:03.299
SAM: Wait, did you not have-- Jesus, never use
that thing again.

01:27:03.299 --> 01:27:04.860
TRAVIS: I'm using it every time.

01:27:04.860 --> 01:27:06.270
(laughter)

01:27:06.270 --> 01:27:10.878
MATT: Doing so gives you advantage on melee weapon
attack rolls using strength during this turn. So

01:27:10.878 --> 01:27:13.986
yes, I apologize. It does give you advantage on
all of your attacks. I misread that.

01:27:13.986 --> 01:27:17.303
TRAVIS: (quietly) Oh, shitfuck. (louder) That's
okay. That's okay!

01:27:17.303 --> 01:27:20.079
LIAM: Stuff happens. Give him a bonus 15 HP or
something.

01:27:20.079 --> 01:27:22.020
MATT: That's okay. Yeah, it's fine. But going
forward, good to know. So it does give you

01:27:22.020 --> 01:27:23.039
advantage on all of your attacks.

01:27:23.039 --> 01:27:23.874
TRAVIS: Copy that.

01:27:23.874 --> 01:27:26.224
MATT: It's the first attack is the one that
confused me on the way it was worded. Sorry,

01:27:26.224 --> 01:27:33.251
folks. I know better now. But for that, I say the
one stands as retribution for me forgetting the rule.

01:27:33.251 --> 01:27:34.859
(cheering)

01:27:34.859 --> 01:27:38.200
MATT: So he goes in to strike for the bite. This
time, however, he does manage to catch the

01:27:38.200 --> 01:27:42.514
chainmail coif that Scanlan had made you. His
fangs get caught on the chain. (grunts)

01:27:42.514 --> 01:27:44.821
TRAVIS: Like making out with braces.

01:27:44.821 --> 01:27:50.961
MATT: He pulls away, releases you-- no, doesn't
release you. As he's holding you there, he's going

01:27:50.961 --> 01:27:59.252
to go ahead and make a claw strike across your
face. Two and, oh. That'll be a 19.

01:27:59.252 --> 01:28:00.449
TRAVIS: That does hit.

01:28:00.449 --> 01:28:06.774
MATT: He does hit? Okay. You take eight points of
slashing damage, reduced to four because of your

01:28:06.774 --> 01:28:09.644
rage. That ends his turn. Grog, you're up now.

01:28:09.644 --> 01:28:11.917
TRAVIS: Am I still grappled?

01:28:11.917 --> 01:28:13.236
MATT: You're still grappled, yeah.

01:28:13.236 --> 01:28:14.598
TRAVIS: I'd like to try and break the grapple.

01:28:14.598 --> 01:28:18.118
MATT: Okay, so you use your action to try and
break the grapple. So athletics roll of?

01:28:18.118 --> 01:28:20.060
TRAVIS: 22.

01:28:20.060 --> 01:28:22.524
MATT: Yeah, you (boof) just shove him off without
a problem.

01:28:22.524 --> 01:28:23.492
TRAVIS: Awesome.

01:28:23.492 --> 01:28:25.387
MATT: You still have your bonus action to strike,
if you like.

01:28:25.387 --> 01:28:28.925
TRAVIS: Can I use my bonus action to try and
grapple him back?

01:28:28.925 --> 01:28:31.959
MATT: Not as a bonus action, unfortunately. It's
an action to do that.

01:28:31.959 --> 01:28:36.243
TRAVIS: I will attack, yeah. Just one, right?
(whoosh)

01:28:36.243 --> 01:28:37.448
MATT: One strike, yeah.

01:28:37.448 --> 01:28:40.511
TRAVIS: Okay. Fuck yes! 21?

01:28:40.511 --> 01:28:42.272
MATT: 21 does hit, yeah.

01:28:42.272 --> 01:28:53.506
TRAVIS: Awesome! And that is badass. Nine, 17. 22.
22 with the fire damage.

01:28:53.506 --> 01:28:58.519
MATT: 22 damage. All right. (whack) And you're
watching, as he does all these actions, you see

01:28:58.519 --> 01:29:03.317
his body begin to reform and the wounds beginning
to heal themselves in the vampiric manner. But as

01:29:03.317 --> 01:29:08.226
soon as that wound begins to sew up, you take
your hammer and (boof) slam it into him again,

01:29:08.367 --> 01:29:12.687
reopening, and you can see now parts of his
muscles are exposed, a deep purplish color, this

01:29:12.687 --> 01:29:19.727
very unnatural interior to his flesh. You can see
it burn as the flames cauterize the edges of the

01:29:19.727 --> 01:29:23.499
wound. Awesome. Does that finish your turn? Do you
want to move at all?

01:29:23.499 --> 01:29:26.245
TRAVIS: I'm staying. Is Trinket still behind me?

01:29:26.245 --> 01:29:30.407
MATT: Trinket is currently flanking the guy.

01:29:30.407 --> 01:29:33.047
TRAVIS: Yeah, no. I'll stay.

01:29:33.047 --> 01:29:43.595
MATT: Okay, that brings us to the guards' turn.
They all reload their crossbows. These four are

01:29:43.595 --> 01:29:50.431
now going to make shots at you, Percy. These three
are going to take shots-- all five of these guys

01:29:50.431 --> 01:29:53.153
are going to take shots at Grog now. They're
trying to take you down so they can move onto the

01:29:53.153 --> 01:30:00.060
next target. So four shots on you, Percy. That is
20?

01:30:00.060 --> 01:30:01.465
TALIESIN: That hits.

01:30:01.465 --> 01:30:03.277
MATT: 18?

01:30:03.277 --> 01:30:04.853
TALIESIN: That hits.

01:30:04.853 --> 01:30:06.208
MATT: 20?

01:30:06.208 --> 01:30:07.571
TALIESIN: That hits.

01:30:07.571 --> 01:30:10.025
MATT: And 11.

01:30:10.025 --> 01:30:11.501
TALIESIN: That does not hit.

01:30:11.501 --> 01:30:25.559
MATT: Okay, so you take from three heavy crossbow
bolts at you. Seven, 19, 32 points of piercing

01:30:25.617 --> 01:30:30.299
damage. All three bolts stick
into your chest. They're big, long, thick, heavy

01:30:30.299 --> 01:30:35.131
crossbow bolts. One of them gleans off your
shoulder and catches the edge of the wall, but the

01:30:35.131 --> 01:30:39.441
other two have actually sunk into your torso and
are sticking out of you. The other five against

01:30:39.441 --> 01:30:40.380
you, Grog.

01:30:40.380 --> 01:30:41.562
TRAVIS: Yep.

01:30:41.562 --> 01:30:47.270
MATT: Since you did not do reckless strike last
time, they are not with advantage. That is 19?

01:30:47.270 --> 01:30:48.873
TRAVIS: Hits.

01:30:48.873 --> 01:30:50.209
MATT: 12?

01:30:50.209 --> 01:30:51.571
TRAVIS: Misses.

01:30:51.571 --> 01:30:53.406
MATT: Oh, that's a 25.

01:30:53.406 --> 01:30:54.674
TRAVIS: Hits.

01:30:54.674 --> 01:30:56.533
MATT: That is a 19?

01:30:56.533 --> 01:30:57.675
TRAVIS: Hits.

01:30:57.675 --> 01:30:59.619
MATT: Last one is a 24.

01:30:59.619 --> 01:31:01.228
TRAVIS: Yep, so four out of the five.

01:31:01.228 --> 01:31:07.865
MATT: Yep. That's 11 plus seven. 18.

01:31:07.865 --> 01:31:09.932
TRAVIS: 18.

01:31:09.932 --> 01:31:11.650
MATT: Plus eight. 25.

01:31:11.650 --> 01:31:12.930
TRAVIS: 26.

01:31:12.930 --> 01:31:14.913
MATT: Plus 13. So 39.

01:31:14.913 --> 01:31:16.373
TRAVIS: 39. Half.

01:31:16.373 --> 01:31:17.493
MATT: 18.

01:31:17.493 --> 01:31:18.497
TRAVIS: Okay.

01:31:18.497 --> 01:31:22.784
MATT: 18 points of piercing damage again. Bolts
are sticking out of your body all over. You almost

01:31:22.784 --> 01:31:26.380
have additional armor from the number of bolts
that are on your body, but you're still standing

01:31:26.380 --> 01:31:31.728
there, frothing at the mouth, angry, just like,
"Come at me!" That ends the guards' turn. They all

01:31:31.728 --> 01:31:35.730
reload their bolts and pull their crossbows up.
Vex, you're up.

01:31:35.788 --> 01:31:39.654
LAURA: Yay! Can I get up to the doorway? Tell me
that I can.

01:31:39.701 --> 01:31:42.406
MATT: With a dash, you can, yeah.

01:31:42.406 --> 01:31:45.311
LAURA: But I don't get any action, then.

01:31:45.311 --> 01:31:47.347
MATT: Unfortunately, no.

01:31:47.347 --> 01:31:48.701
LAURA: Damn it!

01:31:48.701 --> 01:31:50.073
TRAVIS: Janet.

01:31:50.073 --> 01:31:57.051
LAURA: Damn it, Janet! All right, Trinket's just
going to try to claw him.

01:31:57.051 --> 01:32:00.979
MATT: Okay. Go ahead. Two attacks from Trinket.

01:32:00.979 --> 01:32:02.260
LAURA: Yep.

01:32:02.260 --> 01:32:03.407
LIAM: Make it good.

01:32:03.407 --> 01:32:04.832
SAM: Come on, you're my favorite bear, Trinkie.

01:32:04.832 --> 01:32:06.563
LAURA: That hits him. That definitely hits him.

01:32:06.563 --> 01:32:09.335
LIAM: 16 plus a lot.

01:32:09.335 --> 01:32:10.266
LAURA: Yeah.

01:32:10.266 --> 01:32:12.251
MATT: Oh, yeah, that hits him.

01:32:12.251 --> 01:32:13.558
LAURA and LIAM: A natural 20!

01:32:13.558 --> 01:32:15.177
(cheering)

01:32:15.177 --> 01:32:16.901
TRAVIS: (laughs) Trinket got a natural 20?

01:32:16.901 --> 01:32:20.889
MATT: All right, so damage on the first strike?

01:32:20.889 --> 01:32:22.943
SAM: That was a critical "rawrl."

01:32:22.943 --> 01:32:29.547
LAURA: 11 for the first, and then--

01:32:29.547 --> 01:32:32.256
TRAVIS: So sour it was sweet.

01:32:32.256 --> 01:32:36.940
LIAM: Three plus seven is ten. 20? Which part
doubles?

01:32:36.940 --> 01:32:39.214
LAURA: Just the dice doubles?

01:32:39.214 --> 01:32:40.714
MATT: The dice doubles, yeah.

01:32:40.714 --> 01:32:43.563
LAURA: 13 for the second attack.

01:32:43.563 --> 01:32:46.185
MATT: So a total of 23 damage? All right.

01:32:46.185 --> 01:32:47.211
LAURA: 24 damage.

01:32:47.211 --> 01:32:49.075
MATT: 24 damage. How does Trinket want to do
this?

01:32:49.075 --> 01:32:50.777
(cheering)

01:32:50.777 --> 01:32:52.345
LAURA: He really just killed a vampire?

01:32:52.345 --> 01:32:53.549
LIAM: Is this a first?!

01:32:53.549 --> 01:32:55.471
TALIESIN: This is a first.

01:32:55.471 --> 01:32:57.968
TRAVIS: I think it's Trinket's first kill.

01:32:57.968 --> 01:32:59.606
MARISHA: Trinket!

01:32:59.606 --> 01:33:04.307
LAURA: Trinket claws crosswise and takes off his
head with a bite.

01:33:04.307 --> 01:33:09.931
MATT: Okay. So as Trinket reaches down, (whoosh)
arcing both claws across his back, Tylieri is

01:33:09.931 --> 01:33:16.202
dropped to his hands and knees, looks up as
Trinket then puts his jaws down over the head and

01:33:16.202 --> 01:33:22.564
lifts up. As you see the flesh begin to tear on
his body, he screams out in pain as the body

01:33:22.564 --> 01:33:24.157
(fluttering sound) turns to mist.

01:33:24.157 --> 01:33:26.844
LAURA: Damn it! He's a vampire!

01:33:26.844 --> 01:33:28.676
LIAM: Wait, is the mist there?

01:33:28.676 --> 01:33:31.511
MATT: The mist is there, yeah. There's a clump of
mist where he once was.

01:33:31.511 --> 01:33:33.525
LIAM: Somebody light a match!

01:33:33.525 --> 01:33:34.894
MARISHA: I'm coming!

01:33:34.894 --> 01:33:40.012
LAURA: So the head disappears from his mouth, or
did he still get a big taste?

01:33:40.012 --> 01:33:45.793
MATT: There's still some thick, purplish,
congealed blood in his mouth, but the vampire's

01:33:45.793 --> 01:33:52.743
form has been forced to mist at zero hit points.
All right, that brings us to Keyleth.

01:33:52.743 --> 01:34:02.165
MARISHA: Okay! So seeing Vax go over the table
and being like, "That was cool," I'm also going to

01:34:02.209 --> 01:34:07.167
be like (grunts) over the table. I'm going to join
the Dukes of Hazzard train.

01:34:07.167 --> 01:34:08.865
MATT: Acrobatics check.

01:34:08.865 --> 01:34:12.740
MARISHA: Damn it. That's not bad!

01:34:12.740 --> 01:34:15.242
MATT: It's not a huge difficulty.

01:34:15.242 --> 01:34:16.963
MARISHA: Acrobatics? 17?

01:34:16.963 --> 01:34:21.570
MATT: 17, yeah. You jump up (shh) slide across,
land across. The bonus there is that it takes only

01:34:21.570 --> 01:34:25.314
one block of movement to get across. That's five
foot there.

01:34:25.314 --> 01:34:34.344
MARISHA: So I'm going to come in and I see a
headless dude with mist swirling around him?

01:34:34.344 --> 01:34:39.680
MATT: No, you just see Grog, Vax, and Trinket in
the center of this foyer, with a big cloud of mist

01:34:39.680 --> 01:34:45.991
near Trinket and Grog, and an entire array of
guards with heavy crossbows trained down on the

01:34:45.991 --> 01:34:48.397
three of them in this ambush pit.

01:34:48.397 --> 01:34:51.324
SAM: Would she know what it was?

01:34:51.324 --> 01:34:55.145
LAURA: Yeah, you would! We've learned about
vampires. We know they turn into mist.

01:34:55.145 --> 01:34:58.543
LIAM: Yeah, the vampires down by the tree did
this. They misted in.

01:34:58.543 --> 01:34:59.663
TRAVIS: Sunlight that shit.

01:34:59.663 --> 01:35:01.018
LAURA: Sunbeam!

01:35:01.018 --> 01:35:02.945
MARISHA: Someone could yell at me to do it.

01:35:02.945 --> 01:35:04.111
TALIESIN: (shouts) Sunlight!

01:35:04.111 --> 01:35:07.687
MATT: I would say... make an intelligence check.

01:35:07.687 --> 01:35:11.889
MARISHA: Okay. This one.

01:35:11.889 --> 01:35:14.127
SAM: Ooh, that's the intelligent dice.

01:35:14.127 --> 01:35:15.280
TALIESIN: Yes, it is.

01:35:15.280 --> 01:35:18.660
MARISHA: Yes, it is. Just with my modifier?

01:35:18.660 --> 01:35:19.533
MATT: Yeah.

01:35:19.533 --> 01:35:23.282
MARISHA: Wait, is this a saving throw? Just my
modifier, so 17.

01:35:23.282 --> 01:35:30.942
MATT: 17. Okay. I'd say, given the circumstance
right now, just rushing in and seeing mist there

01:35:30.942 --> 01:35:35.360
and people with things, you have no idea that's a
vampire, you have no reason to believe that's a

01:35:35.360 --> 01:35:39.676
vampire, you just know that right now there is--
I'm just being honest here! You walk in the room

01:35:39.676 --> 01:35:42.211
and there's a little bit of mist on the ground and
there's a bunch of guards up there. It looks like

01:35:42.211 --> 01:35:43.943
there's a threat of a bunch of guards in the
room.

01:35:43.943 --> 01:35:46.298
TRAVIS: Identify it. It's a vampire.

01:35:46.298 --> 01:35:48.143
LAURA: You know it now.

01:35:48.143 --> 01:35:51.276
MATT: (laughs) Grog, in the middle of a frenzied
rage, would not have that--

01:35:51.276 --> 01:35:56.328
TALIESIN: I would have enough to point and say--
oh, for the love of god. Okay, fine.

01:35:56.328 --> 01:35:57.717
MATT: Keyleth, take your turn.

01:35:57.717 --> 01:35:58.795
LAURA: Oh, man.

01:35:58.795 --> 01:36:01.379
MATT: No more metagaming. Take your turn. What do
you want to do?

01:36:01.379 --> 01:36:03.309
TRAVIS: What are you doing?

01:36:03.309 --> 01:36:08.313
MARISHA: Well, I know what I want to do, but I
can't do it without feeling guilty! I was going to

01:36:08.313 --> 01:36:09.822
Sunbeam this bitch.

01:36:09.822 --> 01:36:12.292
MATT: It only makes sense. I'm just saying.

01:36:12.292 --> 01:36:14.628
MARISHA: What makes sense? That I wouldn't know?

01:36:14.628 --> 01:36:17.397
MATT: That you wouldn't know that that little bit
of mist on the ground there is a vampire. There's

01:36:17.397 --> 01:36:19.098
no way that Keyleth would know that based on the
way you--

01:36:19.098 --> 01:36:20.407
LIAM: Just missed it.

01:36:20.407 --> 01:36:21.826
MATT: Yeah, you just missed it.

01:36:21.826 --> 01:36:23.056
MARISHA: I would just see a black mist?

01:36:23.056 --> 01:36:24.177
MATT: It's just a mist.

01:36:24.177 --> 01:36:25.669
TRAVIS: We've got a ton of other people in the
room, though.

01:36:25.669 --> 01:36:27.472
MATT: And there's black smoke around one of the
guards up there.

01:36:27.472 --> 01:36:40.222
MARISHA: Well, if I saw a black mist, what I would
probably do, realistically, is think it was some

01:36:40.222 --> 01:36:47.724
sort of poison shit and I would Wind Wall it. So
I'm going to (goosh) Wind Wall that mist.

01:36:47.724 --> 01:36:54.106
MATT: Okay. All righty. Let's see. (laughs) This
should actually be pretty interesting.

01:36:54.106 --> 01:37:00.715
MARISHA: (weakly) It's what I would assume it was,
but I might be aiding it in getting away.

01:37:00.715 --> 01:37:03.614
MATT: All right.

01:37:03.614 --> 01:37:05.861
MARISHA: This is bullshit.

01:37:05.861 --> 01:37:11.150
MATT: All right, so. You put a Wind Wall up
(fwoosh) in this area. You can see the mist

01:37:11.150 --> 01:37:15.762
dissipates for a second and holds its place.
However, this Wind Wall is now currently held up

01:37:15.762 --> 01:37:18.707
in this area. That's your action.

01:37:18.707 --> 01:37:23.862
MARISHA: I Wind Wall it to keep, essentially do
the Wind Wall--

01:37:23.862 --> 01:37:24.830
MATT: Here?

01:37:24.830 --> 01:37:26.113
MARISHA: Yeah, around Grog.

01:37:26.113 --> 01:37:27.275
MATT: Right at this area?

01:37:27.275 --> 01:37:29.102
MARISHA: Yeah, I'd want to protect him from the
crossbows.

01:37:29.102 --> 01:37:33.435
MATT: Okay. So there's just wind rushing up
around. You can see the tapestries on the walls

01:37:33.435 --> 01:37:34.902
are flickering around.

01:37:34.902 --> 01:37:38.437
MARISHA: And then I once again go, "Scanlan!
Scanlan!"

01:37:38.437 --> 01:37:46.453
MATT: There's a little bit of crackling through.
You're right at the cusp of the distance on these

01:37:46.453 --> 01:37:52.048
communicators. Scanlan, you hear bits and pieces.
At this point in time right now, you're--

01:37:52.048 --> 01:37:53.822
SAM: I'm on the roof?

01:37:53.822 --> 01:37:57.431
MATT: You're hearing crackling in your ear, but
you're still on the roof doing the chaos, so you

01:37:57.431 --> 01:38:00.119
haven't heard anything really coming through, at
this point.

01:38:00.119 --> 01:38:01.574
LAURA: "Doing the chaos."

01:38:01.574 --> 01:38:02.768
MATT: You're going to stay right there?

01:38:02.768 --> 01:38:03.863
SAM: I'm doing this thing.

01:38:03.863 --> 01:38:05.402
MATT: Yeah, you're trust-falling off the roof.

01:38:05.402 --> 01:38:08.504
MARISHA: Yeah, I'm going to back into the corner
and keep this Wind Wall up.

01:38:08.504 --> 01:38:11.442
MATT: Okay, just concentrating on the Wind Wall.
That brings us up to Percy.

01:38:11.442 --> 01:38:18.006
TALIESIN: I take my next shot at the next crossbow
bugger.

01:38:18.006 --> 01:38:19.658
MATT: Go for it.

01:38:19.658 --> 01:38:22.898
TALIESIN: That's 15?

01:38:22.898 --> 01:38:25.781
MATT: 15? Just misses.

01:38:25.820 --> 01:38:27.087
TALIESIN: God damn it.

01:38:27.087 --> 01:38:29.651
MATT: It hits the armor and it (ricochet noise)
ricochets off.

01:38:29.651 --> 01:38:34.605
MARISHA: So am I encapsulating the mist in my Wind
Wall? I'm kind of trapping the mist in?

01:38:34.605 --> 01:38:39.505
MATT: The Wind Wall itself is not a full circle,
it's just a semi-circle.

01:38:39.505 --> 01:38:41.837
MARISHA: A half-circle, yeah, but is it stuck in
the wall?

01:38:41.837 --> 01:38:44.265
MATT: It's currently overlapped with it, yeah.

01:38:44.265 --> 01:38:45.771
MARISHA: Okay.

01:38:45.771 --> 01:38:47.912
TALIESIN: That's 22.

01:38:47.912 --> 01:38:49.675
MATT: 22 to hit?

01:38:49.675 --> 01:38:50.579
TALIESIN: Yeah.

01:38:50.579 --> 01:38:51.504
MATT: Hits.

01:38:51.504 --> 01:38:59.759
TALIESIN: It hit. That's 18 points of damage.

01:38:59.759 --> 01:39:02.923
MATT: All righty. And you have your third attack.

01:39:02.923 --> 01:39:08.263
TALIESIN: My third attack, also on him, is also
22.

01:39:08.263 --> 01:39:09.791
MATT: That hits, as well.

01:39:09.791 --> 01:39:18.947
TALIESIN: And that's-- ooh, that sucks. Two points
of ice damage plus 11 points of normal damage.

01:39:18.947 --> 01:39:22.773
MATT: 13 total. Okay. So (doosh) the last two
blasts hit him, and you can see, he almost gets

01:39:22.773 --> 01:39:28.087
thrown off his feet from the impact. There's now
blood trickling out from under his helmet from

01:39:28.135 --> 01:39:32.340
where one of the blasts got his chin. One into his
chest. He's still standing up, barely, and he's

01:39:32.340 --> 01:39:37.820
still confused by this smoke that's swirling
around him. Are you going to stay where you are?

01:39:37.820 --> 01:39:42.591
TALIESIN: I'm going to take a step forward.

01:39:42.591 --> 01:39:44.324
MATT: Right there?

01:39:44.324 --> 01:39:45.504
TALIESIN: Up the stairs.

01:39:45.504 --> 01:39:47.063
MATT: Up the stairs. Okay.

01:39:47.063 --> 01:39:48.240
TALIESIN: Yeah.

01:39:48.240 --> 01:39:52.957
MATT: Just ominously stepping up the stairway. I
like it. That brings us to Vax.

01:39:52.957 --> 01:40:01.910
LIAM: Right, so I'm going to start rushing up the
stairs. Before I do, I'm going to spank Grog as

01:40:01.910 --> 01:40:07.001
hard as I can on the ass and say, "Kill!" And run
up the stairs at the first guy who's enveloped in

01:40:07.001 --> 01:40:08.877
Percy's smoke and start stabbing him.

01:40:08.877 --> 01:40:12.468
MATT: Okay. He's up above the banister, so you
probably have to--

01:40:12.468 --> 01:40:14.125
LIAM: There's no balcony?

01:40:14.125 --> 01:40:19.270
MATT: No, the idea is the banister rides up and
there's a wall along it, and then they're all up

01:40:19.270 --> 01:40:23.150
on the second floor here looking down at this.

01:40:23.150 --> 01:40:24.852
LIAM: So there's no way up there?

01:40:24.852 --> 01:40:26.759
MATT: You could leap up. Make an acrobatics check
to leap up and over the banister.

01:40:26.759 --> 01:40:31.470
LIAM: That's what I'll do. Yeah, that's good.
That's 30.

01:40:31.470 --> 01:40:36.845
MATT: Yeah, you jump, grab it, flip over, land on
the balcony next to the guy enveloped in smoke.

01:40:36.845 --> 01:40:38.714
LIAM: And I stab him.

01:40:38.714 --> 01:40:40.106
MATT: Go for it.

01:40:40.106 --> 01:40:46.833
LIAM: Okay. Did the leaping take any of my
actions? It's movement?

01:40:46.833 --> 01:40:48.525
MATT: No, it's part of your movement.

01:40:48.525 --> 01:40:49.911
LIAM: Okay, so that's 22.

01:40:49.911 --> 01:40:50.923
MATT: 22 hits.

01:40:50.923 --> 01:40:55.402
LIAM: And a 16. And a one.

01:40:55.402 --> 01:40:57.157
MATT: First two hit.

01:40:57.157 --> 01:41:05.373
LIAM: Yeah, okay. The first one is the Flametongue
dagger. That is four plus six is ten. And the

01:41:05.373 --> 01:41:09.344
second one is the keen dagger, and that is two
plus seven is nine.

01:41:09.344 --> 01:41:13.442
MATT: All right. As you rush up, the guard looking
at you, confused, the smoke swirling around him.

01:41:13.442 --> 01:41:19.032
(stabbing sounds) As the first two daggers stab
in, the second one actually finds between his ribs

01:41:19.032 --> 01:41:24.591
up to where his heart is, and you see him gasp for
a second as he crumples beneath your grip, and you

01:41:24.591 --> 01:41:26.675
slide the blade out as he crumples to the ground.

01:41:26.675 --> 01:41:28.377
LIAM: That's the button.

01:41:28.377 --> 01:41:36.169
MATT: (laughs) That is the dead button. All right.
That ends your turn. Tylieri--

01:41:36.169 --> 01:41:37.953
SAM: Wait, he's still alive?

01:41:37.953 --> 01:41:39.417
LAURA: He's a mist.

01:41:39.417 --> 01:41:45.043
MATT: All right, the mist pushes past. He's going
to use some action to move.

01:41:45.043 --> 01:41:51.066
LAURA: He pushes past the Wind Wall? But it says
that figures caught in a gaseous form can't pass

01:41:51.066 --> 01:41:53.537
through the Wind Wall. In the spell.

01:41:53.537 --> 01:41:55.285
MARISHA: That it does.

01:41:55.285 --> 01:41:56.450
LAURA: I just read it.

01:41:56.450 --> 01:41:58.718
MARISHA: That's my motherfucking Wind Wall!

01:41:58.718 --> 01:42:03.713
LAURA: So it's going to screw up my arrows, so I
was checking in. But yeah, it also says,

01:42:03.713 --> 01:42:07.185
"creatures in gaseous form can't pass through
it."

01:42:07.185 --> 01:42:11.206
SAM: Why would they even have a hypothetical for
that?

01:42:11.206 --> 01:42:13.354
LIAM, MARISHA, and TALIESIN: Because of this!

01:42:13.354 --> 01:42:15.337
TALIESIN: Because of the things right here.

01:42:15.337 --> 01:42:17.082
MARISHA: It's coming in handy.

01:42:17.082 --> 01:42:18.845
LIAM: Thanks, Mike Mearls!

01:42:18.845 --> 01:42:23.557
MATT: However, as part of that, then Trinket is
also in the Wind Wall, as well, just as a note. So

01:42:23.557 --> 01:42:29.708
Trinket will be taking bludgeoning damage for
being within it. So just as a heads-up. In fact,

01:42:29.708 --> 01:42:32.460
right now, have Trinket make a strength saving
throw.

01:42:32.460 --> 01:42:33.466
MARISHA: Sorry.

01:42:33.466 --> 01:42:34.846
LAURA: It's okay.

01:42:34.846 --> 01:42:36.854
SAM: Is it like a hurricane or something?

01:42:36.854 --> 01:42:38.671
MARISHA: It's a wall of wind.

01:42:38.671 --> 01:42:39.930
LAURA: Eight?

01:42:39.930 --> 01:42:42.934
MATT: Okay. Trinket takes 3d8 bludgeoning damage.

01:42:42.934 --> 01:42:44.871
MARISHA: How much?

01:42:44.871 --> 01:42:46.374
MATT: Go ahead and roll 3d8.

01:42:46.374 --> 01:42:48.041
LIAM: 3d8. Up to 24.

01:42:48.041 --> 01:42:49.143
SAM: Whoa.

01:42:49.143 --> 01:42:51.069
MATT: Yeah. I thought you were capturing him
inside. I didn't realize you had it actually on

01:42:51.069 --> 01:42:55.960
him, and so having the Wind Wall on him to prevent
him from moving would also have Trinket in it, yeah.

01:42:55.960 --> 01:43:00.467
MARISHA: It could be worse. That's six plus four,
so ten.

01:43:00.467 --> 01:43:02.414
LIAM: He's had worse. He'll be fine.

01:43:02.414 --> 01:43:03.964
LAURA: Yeah. Okay.

01:43:03.964 --> 01:43:16.756
MATT: All right, so that will make it actually
more here. So Tylieri cannot break through.

01:43:16.756 --> 01:43:20.841
Tylieri stays there in mist form, being caught in
the whirlwind. Grog, you're up.

01:43:20.841 --> 01:43:22.102
TRAVIS: I'm up?

01:43:22.102 --> 01:43:23.208
MATT: Yep.

01:43:23.208 --> 01:43:26.554
TRAVIS: Well, I can't get through the-- I mean, I
don't know what the fuck--

01:43:26.554 --> 01:43:27.838
MARISHA: You can get through the Wind Wall.

01:43:27.838 --> 01:43:32.386
TRAVIS: What am I going to do to gas? Hit it? Can
I start running up the motherfucking stairs and

01:43:32.386 --> 01:43:34.641
jump up like Vax did? He said to kill!

01:43:34.641 --> 01:43:43.850
MATT: All right, yeah. You can get up to there,
and you're just within reach to get one guy over

01:43:43.850 --> 01:43:45.334
the banister, probably.

01:43:45.334 --> 01:43:49.715
TRAVIS: Yeah! I'd like to do that. That's a 23.

01:43:49.715 --> 01:43:51.980
MATT: That hits. More attacks?

01:43:51.980 --> 01:43:54.810
TRAVIS: Yes. Oh, how many attacks do I get?

01:43:54.810 --> 01:43:56.227
MATT: All of them. That was just your movement.

01:43:56.227 --> 01:43:57.974
TRAVIS: Yay, I get all of them?! That's amazing.

01:43:57.974 --> 01:43:59.428
MATT: Your barbarian 40 feet of crazy movement.

01:43:59.428 --> 01:44:01.156
TRAVIS: Yay! 22!

01:44:01.156 --> 01:44:02.639
MATT: Yep.

01:44:02.639 --> 01:44:05.437
TRAVIS: Shit! 12.

01:44:05.437 --> 01:44:06.962
MATT: 12 does not hit.

01:44:06.962 --> 01:44:08.246
TRAVIS: (laughing) Okay.

01:44:08.246 --> 01:44:10.003
MATT: (laughs) The first two hit.

01:44:10.003 --> 01:44:14.744
TRAVIS: 13. 17 for the first one.

01:44:14.744 --> 01:44:16.521
MATT: All right, 17 damage.

01:44:16.521 --> 01:44:23.193
TRAVIS: 15, and 17 again. Two plus two.

01:44:23.193 --> 01:44:28.456
MATT: Nice. All right, so (whack) the hammer comes
streaking down, slamming into the guard there. His

01:44:28.456 --> 01:44:32.216
crossbow shatters from the impact and the flames
begin to lick up the front of his body. The second

01:44:32.216 --> 01:44:36.256
slam smacks him again. This time, you hear the
armor ring out from the metal-on-metal impact. He

01:44:36.256 --> 01:44:40.267
kind of shakes from it. The third time you're just
in the middle of this series of swinging and he

01:44:40.267 --> 01:44:43.811
backs up, and you end up smashing the banister
instead of him, the hammer cracking part of the

01:44:43.811 --> 01:44:49.995
ground on the second floor. He looks pretty messed
up from that series of attacks. All right, that

01:44:49.995 --> 01:44:54.144
ends your turn, Grog. It's now the guards' turn.

01:44:54.144 --> 01:44:55.670
TRAVIS: Come at me, bro.

01:44:55.670 --> 01:45:01.412
MATT: This guard's going to move over here.
They're all like, "Oh god." These three here are

01:45:01.412 --> 01:45:05.390
going to attempt to fire on Trinket through the
Wind Wall. These two are going to fire at you,

01:45:05.390 --> 01:45:11.940
Grog, and these two are going to longsword you.
They pull out their longswords. This one's going

01:45:11.940 --> 01:45:17.010
to turn with his crossbow and fire at you, Vax. So
first is the attack at you with the crossbow. That

01:45:17.010 --> 01:45:18.188
is a 20?

01:45:18.188 --> 01:45:19.623
LIAM: Oh, yeah, that hits.

01:45:19.623 --> 01:45:24.548
MATT: You take-- ooh, that's a ten-- 13 points of
piercing damage as the bolt strikes you right in

01:45:24.548 --> 01:45:29.045
the chest, cracking your sternum a little bit.
You're like, (groans) that's going to suck. You

01:45:29.045 --> 01:45:34.223
feel the scraping of the bone as it impacts. The
two with the longswords against you, Grog.

01:45:34.223 --> 01:45:35.619
TRAVIS: Yep.

01:45:35.619 --> 01:45:37.479
MATT: That is 18?

01:45:37.479 --> 01:45:38.664
TRAVIS: Misses.

01:45:38.664 --> 01:45:40.391
MATT: That is a 12.

01:45:40.391 --> 01:45:41.580
TRAVIS: Misses!

01:45:41.580 --> 01:45:46.572
MATT: Both of the blades come at you. One of them
actually hits your shoulder, but it just sticks an

01:45:46.572 --> 01:45:50.822
inch into the flesh, and you just flex and the
blade pops out. The second one swings out and you

01:45:50.822 --> 01:45:54.368
duck your head out of the way and it (whoosh) goes
long and you just grin through the anger. That's

01:45:54.368 --> 01:46:02.385
awesome. Then these two are going to fire
crossbows at you, Grog. That is going to be a 15?

01:46:02.385 --> 01:46:03.718
TRAVIS: Misses.

01:46:03.718 --> 01:46:05.177
MATT: And a 23.

01:46:05.177 --> 01:46:07.687
TRAVIS: Damn, I was almost Neo, just dodging all
sorts of shit.

01:46:07.687 --> 01:46:10.499
MATT: Another ten. 13 points of piercing damage.

01:46:10.499 --> 01:46:11.968
TRAVIS: Halved to seven?

01:46:11.968 --> 01:46:16.209
MATT: Half that to seven, yeah. And then now the
three aiming at Trinket. They all have

01:46:16.209 --> 01:46:17.965
disadvantage, I believe?

01:46:17.965 --> 01:46:19.753
LAURA: Nothing can shoot through the Wind Wall.

01:46:19.753 --> 01:46:20.945
MATT: Nothing can shoot through it at all?

01:46:20.945 --> 01:46:22.581
LAURA: Arrows can't go through it, it said.

01:46:22.581 --> 01:46:23.628
MATT: At all?!

01:46:23.628 --> 01:46:24.698
TRAVIS: She said begrudgingly.

01:46:24.698 --> 01:46:26.104
LAURA: Which fucking sucks.

01:46:26.104 --> 01:46:31.678
MARISHA: Well, I mean, it's going to save a bear,
right? After I punched him with the wind.

01:46:31.678 --> 01:46:33.526
SAM: Yeah, and also kill the bear.

01:46:33.526 --> 01:46:37.617
MATT: Yeah, they automatically miss. They all
three fire through. All bolts just (shhh) get

01:46:37.617 --> 01:46:39.997
scattered across the room.

01:46:40.038 --> 01:46:41.629
LAURA: Yeah, it goes straight up to the roof, it
says.

01:46:41.629 --> 01:46:42.645
MATT: Wind Wall. That's awesome.

01:46:42.645 --> 01:46:45.587
LAURA: Does the Wind Wall go all the way up to the
ceiling, or does it go to a certain height?

01:46:45.587 --> 01:46:46.870
MARISHA: 15 foot high.

01:46:46.870 --> 01:46:51.243
MATT: 50 feet long, 15 feet high. So it doesn't go
all the way to the ceiling. In fact, it gets just

01:46:51.243 --> 01:46:55.813
a little bit past the second floor, so it's about
the height of the guys on the second platform.

01:46:55.813 --> 01:46:59.411
That ends their turn. Vex, you're up.

01:46:59.411 --> 01:47:02.438
LAURA: Okay. I'm going to tell Trinket to get out
of the Wind Wall.

01:47:02.438 --> 01:47:04.287
MATT: Okay.

01:47:04.287 --> 01:47:06.071
SAM: The Wind Wall gets an attack of opportunity.

01:47:06.071 --> 01:47:07.386
(laughter)

01:47:07.386 --> 01:47:09.067
LAURA: Well, he's going to move.

01:47:09.067 --> 01:47:10.350
MATT: He goes to the front door.

01:47:10.350 --> 01:47:12.790
LAURA: And he's going to be very happy to see me
come around the corner of that door.

01:47:12.790 --> 01:47:13.907
MATT: All right.

01:47:13.907 --> 01:47:19.557
LAURA: Where I will see a bunch of dudes up high,
and I want to try to do Conjure Barrage up and

01:47:19.557 --> 01:47:24.186
over the Wind Wall and in an arc downward on
everybody on the other side of it.

01:47:24.186 --> 01:47:25.474
MATT: Interesting. Okay.

01:47:25.474 --> 01:47:29.910
LAURA: It's like a (whoo, boom).

01:47:29.910 --> 01:47:31.357
TRAVIS: A half-pull.

01:47:31.357 --> 01:47:35.114
MATT: Yeah, which at this short distance, is not a
lot of strength to get the lob.

01:47:35.273 --> 01:47:38.278
LAURA: I'm a really skilled archer. I'm kind of
like Legolas.

01:47:38.278 --> 01:47:42.134
MATT: But if you're shooting up this way? The Wind
Wall itself only really encompasses the bottom of

01:47:42.134 --> 01:47:45.449
the foyer, so if you go up the stairs a little
bit, you will be able to get these guys here.

01:47:45.449 --> 01:47:46.597
LAURA: Can I get up there?

01:47:46.597 --> 01:47:47.526
MATT: Yeah.

01:47:47.526 --> 01:47:50.148
LAURA: Oh, yeah! Fuck yeah, I'll do it and try to
get everybody in that cone. Sorry, guys.

01:47:50.148 --> 01:47:51.293
TRAVIS: Nope. Make it rain.

01:47:51.293 --> 01:47:53.976
MATT: Yeah, you're going to hit all of them.

01:47:53.976 --> 01:47:55.973
TRAVIS: Just go for it. I'm a fan of one-dollar
bills.

01:47:55.973 --> 01:47:57.408
LIAM: I can take it.

01:47:57.408 --> 01:48:03.379
LAURA: Okay. Wait, I've got to see how this works.
I just throw it in the air and it turns into a cone.

01:48:03.379 --> 01:48:04.694
MATT: Yep.

01:48:04.694 --> 01:48:06.311
LAURA: So I don't have to attack?

01:48:06.311 --> 01:48:09.350
MATT: They should have a saving throw, I believe,
right?

01:48:09.350 --> 01:48:11.163
LAURA: Yeah, they have a dexterity saving throw.

01:48:11.163 --> 01:48:13.807
MATT: Everyone make a dexterity saving throw. Or
at least you two.

01:48:13.807 --> 01:48:14.754
LIAM: Yeah.

01:48:14.754 --> 01:48:16.386
TRAVIS: Do I have advantage-- I don't know.

01:48:16.386 --> 01:48:18.052
LAURA: I'm casting this as a 3rd-level.

01:48:18.052 --> 01:48:21.201
MATT: One guy makes the saving throw.

01:48:21.201 --> 01:48:23.760
LIAM: 25.

01:48:23.760 --> 01:48:25.062
TRAVIS: 20.

01:48:25.062 --> 01:48:30.938
MATT: You all succeed. One of the villains makes
it, and they both make it. Is it half-damage,

01:48:30.938 --> 01:48:31.905
right?

01:48:31.905 --> 01:48:33.867
LAURA: What about all those guys up at the top?

01:48:33.917 --> 01:48:35.597
MATT: That's what I'm saying. This guy made it,
these two didn't.

01:48:35.597 --> 01:48:37.061
LAURA: What about the other ones?

01:48:37.061 --> 01:48:40.220
MATT: Are you doing it from this perspective?
These will go through the Wind Wall, so the Wind

01:48:40.220 --> 01:48:43.626
Wall itself will prevent it from getting to
either. This guy will probably be hit, actually.

01:48:43.626 --> 01:48:44.904
LAURA: Okay.

01:48:44.904 --> 01:48:50.781
MATT: He fails. So yeah, these guys are unaffected
because the Wind Wall prevents the barrage from

01:48:50.781 --> 01:48:53.318
that point. So just go ahead and roll damage.

01:48:53.318 --> 01:48:55.587
LAURA: So I can't get a critical hit on this
because I don't have to roll?

01:48:55.587 --> 01:48:56.839
MATT: Correct.

01:48:56.839 --> 01:48:58.431
TRAVIS: That's good.

01:48:58.431 --> 01:49:02.774
LAURA: 16, am I right? 16. Okay.

01:49:02.774 --> 01:49:03.781
MATT: 16 damage?

01:49:03.781 --> 01:49:04.548
LAURA: Yeah.

01:49:04.548 --> 01:49:05.944
MATT: All right, so it's half that for saves,
right?

01:49:05.944 --> 01:49:06.572
LAURA: Yeah.

01:49:06.572 --> 01:49:08.367
MATT: All right, so eight damage, four damage.

01:49:08.367 --> 01:49:10.264
LIAM: Oh, uncanny dodge.

01:49:10.264 --> 01:49:11.362
MATT: Okay.

01:49:11.362 --> 01:49:17.581
LIAM: Half that. So what did you give me for
damage?

01:49:17.581 --> 01:49:20.039
TALIESIN: You had eight.

01:49:20.039 --> 01:49:21.312
LIAM: Eight? That's four.

01:49:21.312 --> 01:49:28.263
LAURA: And then as a bonus action, I'm going to
Hunter's Mark. Who looks the strongest?

01:49:28.263 --> 01:49:29.384
TRAVIS: Me.

01:49:29.384 --> 01:49:30.624
LAURA: Not you.

01:49:30.624 --> 01:49:34.293
MATT: (laughs) They're all pretty standard.
There's one dude over here that appears to be

01:49:34.293 --> 01:49:35.321
commanding them.

01:49:35.321 --> 01:49:36.786
LAURA: Yeah, I want to hit him!

01:49:36.786 --> 01:49:45.044
MATT: Okay, you Hunter's Mark him. All righty. He
is Hunter's Marked. All righty. By the way, the

01:49:45.044 --> 01:49:49.667
guy that Grog had slammed? The barrage (arrow
impact) riddles him with arrows and he falls over

01:49:49.667 --> 01:49:54.021
and is like (gasps) and crumples to the ground.
The last bit of health that he had.

01:49:54.021 --> 01:49:56.010
TRAVIS: You took away my playmate!

01:49:56.010 --> 01:49:58.610
MATT: Vex, that's the end of your turn. Keyleth,
you're up.

01:49:58.610 --> 01:50:04.998
MARISHA: Okay. So I'm going to keep maintaining
this Wind Wall and wrap it up around the mist to

01:50:04.998 --> 01:50:09.195
double-enforce it, and I'm going to scream, "What
is this?"

01:50:09.195 --> 01:50:11.921
LAURA: I don't know!

01:50:11.921 --> 01:50:14.414
MATT: All right, and then what are you doing?

01:50:14.414 --> 01:50:19.592
TALIESIN: "It's a vampire!" I'm putting my gun
away, anyway.

01:50:19.592 --> 01:50:21.055
MATT: Okay.

01:50:21.055 --> 01:50:23.002
MARISHA: Does that count?

01:50:23.002 --> 01:50:28.189
LIAM: It's a vampire. We just killed him. Sort
of.

01:50:28.189 --> 01:50:32.806
MATT: Be warned: treading thin ice with metagaming
with your DM going forward, but yes. You have now

01:50:32.806 --> 01:50:33.919
heard it from Percy.

01:50:33.919 --> 01:50:36.379
MARISHA: I'm not metagaming! I'm legitimately
asking whether this counts!

01:50:36.379 --> 01:50:40.414
MATT: I know. That's fine. This counts, it's fine.
You heard Percy say, "Vampire!"

01:50:40.414 --> 01:50:42.479
TALIESIN AND LAURA: Vampire!

01:50:42.479 --> 01:50:46.391
MARISHA: (weakly) Oh! Great!

01:50:46.391 --> 01:50:51.735
TALIESIN: What's that charisma score, again? Where
is it?

01:50:51.735 --> 01:50:53.409
SAM: And we fade to black.

01:50:53.409 --> 01:50:56.500
LAURA: Drop your fucking Wind Wall so I can hit
something!

01:50:56.500 --> 01:51:04.692
MARISHA: I'll drop the Wind Wall and cast Sunbeam
and, eyes flashing, light just (goom), right in

01:51:04.692 --> 01:51:09.415
the concentrated beam where I have this mist
there.

01:51:09.415 --> 01:51:10.681
MATT: Okay.

01:51:10.681 --> 01:51:11.804
LIAM: And stuff.

01:51:11.804 --> 01:51:13.369
MARISHA: And stuff.

01:51:13.369 --> 01:51:21.969
MATT: Okay. Yeah, that will be considered direct
sunlight. As you release the Wind Wall, the mist

01:51:21.969 --> 01:51:25.908
immediately begins to push its way this way out of
the room. However, you catch it, your eyes glow,

01:51:25.908 --> 01:51:31.683
and as you release your hand forward, a blast of
pure sun energy shoots forth from your hands. You

01:51:31.683 --> 01:51:36.990
see it burning the back wall like a big, thick
laser, and as the mist tries to escape, you catch

01:51:36.990 --> 01:51:42.337
up to it, and you hear this faint, echoing,
screeching cry as the mist immediately is

01:51:42.337 --> 01:51:45.411
evaporated on impact. (explosion noise)

01:51:45.411 --> 01:51:47.515
LAURA: Can we loot the mist?

01:51:47.515 --> 01:51:51.013
TRAVIS: (laughs) "Can we loot the mist?"

01:51:51.013 --> 01:51:53.186
MATT: You can fill a pocket with ash, if you
like.

01:51:53.186 --> 01:51:55.482
TRAVIS: Come on, at least some coins falling?

01:51:55.482 --> 01:51:59.652
LAURA: (ding ding ding) Like Scott Pilgrim? Oh,
look! Coins. (laughs)

01:51:59.652 --> 01:52:01.142
MARISHA: That's my turn.

01:52:01.142 --> 01:52:02.314
MATT: All righty.

01:52:02.314 --> 01:52:06.241
SAM: Wait, can you use your bonus action to wink
at Matt to ask for forgiveness?

01:52:06.241 --> 01:52:09.672
MARISHA: Why do &lt;i&gt;I&lt;/i&gt; have to ask for forgiveness?!

01:52:09.672 --> 01:52:11.108
MATT: Percy, you're up.

01:52:11.108 --> 01:52:14.231
MARISHA: I can use my bonus action to heal
somebody, if someone wants it. Actually, how about

01:52:14.231 --> 01:52:17.674
this? I used my bonus action to ask what the shit
was this.

01:52:17.674 --> 01:52:18.779
MATT: There you go.

01:52:18.779 --> 01:52:20.050
MARISHA: Does that make you feel better?

01:52:20.050 --> 01:52:21.006
MATT: Sure.

01:52:21.006 --> 01:52:23.138
TALIESIN: What's the damage on my rapier, again?
Was it 1d10 plus--

01:52:23.138 --> 01:52:29.515
MATT: 1d8. It's a plus-one rapier, so it's 1d8
plus your dexterity modifier, plus one, so it

01:52:29.515 --> 01:52:32.402
would be plus seven for you.

01:52:32.402 --> 01:52:39.683
TALIESIN: Okay. Then in that case, I'm going to
bring my Hex up to the very next--

01:52:39.683 --> 01:52:41.178
MATT: Right there?

01:52:41.178 --> 01:52:45.275
TALIESIN: And I'm going to put my gun away,
walk up to him, and begin stabbing.

01:52:45.324 --> 01:52:49.702
MATT: All right. One, two, three, four, five. At
that height you're going to have to leap up onto

01:52:49.702 --> 01:52:51.111
the second floor to get to him.

01:52:51.111 --> 01:52:52.504
TALIESIN: Oh, that's right.

01:52:52.504 --> 01:52:54.444
MATT: Yeah, so go ahead and make an acrobatics
check, if you want.

01:52:54.444 --> 01:52:58.563
TALIESIN: I'm just going to walk up, not quite
that close, but one step back.

01:52:58.563 --> 01:53:00.030
MATT: Okay, so there?

01:53:00.030 --> 01:53:01.184
TALIESIN: Take my next three shots.

01:53:01.184 --> 01:53:03.545
MATT: Walk up the stairs. Go for it.

01:53:03.545 --> 01:53:06.491
TALIESIN: That's 21.

01:53:06.491 --> 01:53:07.849
MATT: Hits.

01:53:07.849 --> 01:53:11.130
TALIESIN: That's 23.

01:53:11.130 --> 01:53:12.668
MATT: Hits.

01:53:12.668 --> 01:53:14.373
TALIESIN: I'm going to stop there in case that
kills him.

01:53:14.373 --> 01:53:16.923
MATT: Okay. Go ahead and roll damage.

01:53:16.923 --> 01:53:18.805
TALIESIN: Actually, I had to reload anyway.

01:53:18.805 --> 01:53:21.108
MATT: So there you go. So your third attack is to
reload.

01:53:21.108 --> 01:53:22.930
TALIESIN: All three was reload, attack, attack.

01:53:22.930 --> 01:53:23.954
MATT: Okay.

01:53:23.954 --> 01:53:29.170
TALIESIN: So that's 16.

01:53:29.170 --> 01:53:31.459
MATT: 16. All righty.

01:53:31.459 --> 01:53:34.751
TALIESIN: 14.

01:53:34.751 --> 01:53:44.819
MATT: (gunshot) He is blasted out of place. You
can see there's a gaping hole across where one of

01:53:44.819 --> 01:53:48.560
his lungs was located, and he (groans) crumples to
the ground into a pile.

01:53:48.560 --> 01:53:51.056
TALIESIN: Okay, I move the mist to the next guy.

01:53:51.056 --> 01:54:03.179
MATT: All righty. You use a bonus action to
re-curse him, by the way.

01:54:03.179 --> 01:54:06.034
TALIESIN: I had a bonus action, so I just used
it.

01:54:06.034 --> 01:54:11.403
MATT: That's right, you do. Technically, you used
the bonus action this turn to put it onto him from

01:54:11.403 --> 01:54:12.441
the last turn.

01:54:12.441 --> 01:54:15.655
TALIESIN: Did I? You're technically correct, so go
ahead.

01:54:15.655 --> 01:54:18.097
MATT: You're probably going to do it on your next
turn, anyway, so we'll just leave it there. It's

01:54:18.097 --> 01:54:20.412
fine. But keep that in mind, as this is a new
ability.

01:54:20.412 --> 01:54:21.470
LIAM: (sneezes)

01:54:21.470 --> 01:54:22.543
MATT: Gesundheit.

01:54:22.543 --> 01:54:23.547
LAURA and MARISHA: Bless you.

01:54:23.547 --> 01:54:25.373
MATT: All right. Vax, you're up.

01:54:25.373 --> 01:54:28.254
LIAM: Is that fellow who's enveloped in schmutz
right next to Grog?

01:54:28.254 --> 01:54:29.047
MATT: Yep.

01:54:29.047 --> 01:54:30.284
LIAM: Yeah, I'm going to stab him.

01:54:30.284 --> 01:54:31.634
(laughter)

01:54:31.634 --> 01:54:33.554
SAM: Your answer for everything.

01:54:33.601 --> 01:54:36.540
LIAM: First one is not that great. It's a 14.

01:54:36.540 --> 01:54:37.754
MATT: 14 misses.

01:54:37.754 --> 01:54:39.250
LIAM: Second one is a 26.

01:54:39.250 --> 01:54:40.861
MATT: You are flanking him, though. You have
advantage on the attack.

01:54:40.861 --> 01:54:45.339
LIAM: Oh, well let's do that again, then. We'll
call that a 27 instead.

01:54:45.339 --> 01:54:46.479
MATT: That hits.

01:54:46.479 --> 01:54:53.994
LIAM: And then the second one is now a 20, and the
third one is a 26. (shunk, shunk, shunk) Two plus

01:54:53.994 --> 01:55:01.119
seven is nine for the keen dagger, and then for
the life-stealing dagger is a seven, and then back

01:55:01.119 --> 01:55:04.248
to the keen dagger, that is an 11.

01:55:04.248 --> 01:55:06.194
LAURA: Don't you get sneak attack damage?

01:55:06.194 --> 01:55:08.258
LIAM: Oh, right. Yeah, I'll put that in. Thank
you.

01:55:08.258 --> 01:55:10.804
MATT: I was like, "Where's that? That's the whole
point of this."

01:55:10.804 --> 01:55:15.699
SAM: All those?! Holy crap.

01:55:15.699 --> 01:55:19.792
LIAM: Eight, nine, ten, 11, 17, 19.

01:55:19.792 --> 01:55:22.410
MATT: (explosion noise)

01:55:22.410 --> 01:55:23.789
LAURA: Oh, no, Grog!

01:55:23.789 --> 01:55:25.144
MARISHA: Oh god, you killed Grog!

01:55:25.144 --> 01:55:32.539
MATT: Yeah, the daggers cut through his
midsection, and you see where the armor plating

01:55:32.539 --> 01:55:37.277
itself was exposed from the first strike. The last
one you just jam up into his torso, taking out any

01:55:37.277 --> 01:55:38.359
major organs.

01:55:38.359 --> 01:55:40.148
LIAM: I would also like to boot him over the side
as I do this.

01:55:40.148 --> 01:55:44.188
MATT: (groans) He falls over (thudding) down the
stairs, past you, Percy. You let him tumble by as

01:55:44.188 --> 01:55:45.867
he slides to a stop at the very bottom of the
stairs.

01:55:45.867 --> 01:55:47.612
LAURA: I put my foot on him to stop him.

01:55:47.612 --> 01:55:51.735
MATT: Okay, Vex stops him in place, face-down.
There's a smear of his blood across the steps.

01:55:51.735 --> 01:56:01.806
This once-nice, fine wood is now completely coated
in crimson. (laughs) Okay. Grog, you're up.

01:56:01.806 --> 01:56:06.443
TRAVIS: Is it me? (stuttering) Is it just a row of
guys in front of me?

01:56:06.443 --> 01:56:07.794
MATT: Yeah.

01:56:07.794 --> 01:56:16.178
TRAVIS: I would like to hold my turn. Because if I
stand in front of them, nobody can do anything to them.

01:56:16.178 --> 01:56:17.835
SAM: You can.

01:56:17.835 --> 01:56:21.770
LAURA: That's nice of you. You could just go
(whoosh) and cross them off.

01:56:21.770 --> 01:56:23.122
MARISHA: How many's left?

01:56:23.122 --> 01:56:25.653
MATT: There are five nervous-looking guards right
now.

01:56:25.653 --> 01:56:27.771
MARISHA: They were trying to haul ass out?

01:56:27.771 --> 01:56:30.354
TRAVIS: Nah, I'll hold. Whoever's next can go.

01:56:30.354 --> 01:56:31.779
SAM: So polite.

01:56:31.779 --> 01:56:33.960
LAURA: That is really kind of you, Grog.

01:56:33.960 --> 01:56:38.977
MATT: That ends your turn. It is now the guards'
turn. They all...

01:56:39.026 --> 01:56:40.895
LAURA: Run away.

01:56:40.947 --> 01:56:42.467
MARISHA: They're going to try and flee, aren't
they?

01:56:42.467 --> 01:56:49.760
MATT: They look to each other, and their one
leader goes like, "Men, run!" They all rush and

01:56:49.760 --> 01:56:52.447
leap off the balcony, try and catch themselves
there.

01:56:52.447 --> 01:56:55.036
LIAM: See those acrobatics checks...

01:56:55.085 --> 01:56:57.200
LAURA: I want them all to fall, please.

01:56:57.200 --> 01:56:59.065
MARISHA: Eat it. Make them all eat it.

01:56:59.065 --> 01:57:04.331
MATT: Okay. Three of them land fine and begin
bolting forward. Two of them fall. One of them

01:57:04.331 --> 01:57:07.455
(cracking noise) breaks his ankle and falls to the
ground going (scream). The other one slams into

01:57:07.455 --> 01:57:14.040
his hip on the ground and falls prone. These guys
are prone. These three continue to move forward to

01:57:14.040 --> 01:57:16.178
there. They're going for a full dash.

01:57:16.178 --> 01:57:17.714
LAURA: Does Trinket get an attack of opportunity?

01:57:17.714 --> 01:57:22.170
MATT: Against one of them. He can only take one
reaction per turn. They all rush out.

01:57:22.170 --> 01:57:26.958
LAURA: That definitely hits him, though.

01:57:26.958 --> 01:57:28.517
MATT: All righty.

01:57:28.517 --> 01:57:29.694
LAURA: 27.

01:57:29.694 --> 01:57:32.631
MATT: 27 hits. Go ahead and roll damage.

01:57:32.631 --> 01:57:34.036
LAURA: 11.

01:57:34.036 --> 01:57:41.356
MATT: 11 points of damage. Across that guy. Okay.
Trinket reaches out and strikes across one of the

01:57:41.400 --> 01:57:45.508
guys, the guy you Hunter's Marked, who takes the
claw across the side of his head, and you hear him

01:57:45.508 --> 01:57:51.886
yell out in pain, (scream) as he makes it out into
the rain. Hurt, but not taken down. He continues

01:57:51.886 --> 01:57:54.974
to run past, and they all dart outside into the
rainstorm.

01:57:54.974 --> 01:57:57.167
TRAVIS: I'll take my turn now.

01:57:57.167 --> 01:57:59.082
MATT: (laughs) Okay, Grog.

01:57:59.082 --> 01:58:04.461
TRAVIS: I leap over the banister with my war
hammer high and jump down on the guy that's

01:58:04.461 --> 01:58:10.386
closest to me, bringing it down with a reckless
attack and great weapon master.

01:58:10.386 --> 01:58:13.156
MATT: Okay, make an athletics check for the jump.

01:58:13.156 --> 01:58:14.359
TRAVIS: Okay.

01:58:14.359 --> 01:58:16.047
SAM: Oh no, don't fall on your ass.

01:58:16.047 --> 01:58:19.117
TRAVIS: Okay, that's true. 13.

01:58:19.117 --> 01:58:22.262
MATT: I'll give you advantage on this because
you're raging and it's reckless and it's just

01:58:22.262 --> 01:58:23.174
funnier.

01:58:23.174 --> 01:58:24.496
TRAVIS and LAURA: That's better!

01:58:24.496 --> 01:58:25.484
TRAVIS: 24.

01:58:25.484 --> 01:58:32.122
MATT: 24, yeah. You leap in the air (whoosh) like
slow-motion (whoosh, explosion) down on top. Go

01:58:32.122 --> 01:58:34.235
ahead and roll three attacks on him.

01:58:34.235 --> 01:58:41.312
TRAVIS: Amazing, that's 27. That's 26.

01:58:41.312 --> 01:58:42.911
MATT: Roll damage on those.

01:58:42.911 --> 01:58:52.461
TRAVIS: Okay, not a problem. Ten, 19, 29 on the
first one.

01:58:52.461 --> 01:58:54.568
MATT: 29 on the first one? Okay.

01:58:54.568 --> 01:59:00.466
TRAVIS: (laughing) And 28 on the second one.

01:59:00.466 --> 01:59:04.740
MATT: So as you come down, the hammer blow slams
into his torso, his actual metal armor

01:59:04.740 --> 01:59:09.194
crinks inward, and he goes, (screams)
gasping in pain, as you've now jammed his own ribs

01:59:09.194 --> 01:59:15.406
into his internal organs. As you pull the hammer
up with a sludgy, sucking sound you see

01:59:15.406 --> 01:59:18.791
him look at you with this look of, "No!" and the hammer
comes down again. This time on top of his head,

01:59:18.947 --> 01:59:26.177
which, Gallagher watermelon, just (boosh) across
the floor of this. Done, you look over at his

01:59:26.177 --> 01:59:29.381
friend, who is like, (gasps) trying to back up
with his broken ankle. With your third attack,

01:59:29.381 --> 01:59:30.977
he's within your range.

01:59:30.977 --> 01:59:32.363
LAURA: Oh god.

01:59:32.363 --> 01:59:33.896
TRAVIS: (inarticulate war cry)

01:59:33.896 --> 01:59:35.177
MATT: With advantage.

01:59:35.177 --> 01:59:37.164
TRAVIS: Oh, I don't need it. That's 27.

01:59:37.164 --> 01:59:39.355
MATT: Roll advantage just in case it's a
critical.

01:59:39.355 --> 01:59:41.076
TRAVIS: Oh, it's the same thing. It's 27.

01:59:41.076 --> 01:59:42.541
MATT: Okay, there you go. That hits.

01:59:42.541 --> 01:59:44.430
TRAVIS: I know. I haven't critted in forever.

01:59:44.430 --> 01:59:47.993
MATT: Even if you don't need the advantage, it's
nice to roll a second time in case because there's

01:59:47.993 --> 01:59:50.149
a chance of a natural 20.

01:59:50.194 --> 01:59:51.372
TRAVIS: That's 20, 30.

01:59:51.372 --> 01:59:56.710
MATT: 30 points of damage on him. (whack) This one
you actually bring down onto his other leg. That

01:59:56.710 --> 01:59:57.740
leg snaps.

01:59:57.740 --> 01:59:59.162
TRAVIS: Is he on his back?

01:59:59.162 --> 02:00:00.612
MATT: He's on his back and he's trying to pull
away from you.

02:00:00.612 --> 02:00:01.657
TRAVIS: Right on the knee.

02:00:01.657 --> 02:00:04.782
MATT: Right on the knee? (crack) It snaps
underneath and he screams out in pain as the

02:00:04.782 --> 02:00:09.430
hammer pulls back. You can see where the bone is
jutting out. You've actually taken off the lower

02:00:09.430 --> 02:00:13.830
half of his leg from the sheer bludgeoning force,
and he's now bleeding out onto the ground a little

02:00:13.830 --> 02:00:17.983
bit. Not as much as he would be, because the flame
cauterized the impact from the hammer.

02:00:18.132 --> 02:00:19.887
SAM: (pained) So detailed.

02:00:19.887 --> 02:00:27.672
MATT: He is in a really, really bad place. All
righty. Vex, you're up.

02:00:27.672 --> 02:00:33.888
LAURA: Well, I'm going to-- should I shoot at the
guys running away?

02:00:33.888 --> 02:00:35.051
TRAVIS: Yes.

02:00:35.051 --> 02:00:37.352
LAURA: Yeah. Are they close by?

02:00:37.352 --> 02:00:39.609
MATT: They're just out the front of the doors.

02:00:39.609 --> 02:00:41.028
LAURA: I'm going to come down and get in range.

02:00:41.028 --> 02:00:43.694
SAM: Don't forget to tell them about Gilmore's
Glorious Goods first.

02:00:43.694 --> 02:00:45.577
(laughter)

02:00:45.577 --> 02:00:47.465
SAM: We're supposed to advertise!

02:00:47.465 --> 02:00:50.048
MATT: (giggles) Timing is everything.

02:00:50.048 --> 02:00:55.751
LAURA: I'm going to lightning arrow because
everything within ten feet is affected.

02:00:55.751 --> 02:01:02.309
MATT: Yeah, that would hit all three. All right,
you pull out your arrow. You aim it close. You can

02:01:02.309 --> 02:01:05.216
see the rain pouring down and they're all running
out into the storm. You're like,

02:01:05.216 --> 02:01:07.725
"Storm, that's interesting." And you release.

02:01:07.761 --> 02:01:09.928
LAURA: 27? No, that's a lie. 19.

02:01:09.928 --> 02:01:11.457
MATT: Against the guy you've Hunter's Marked?

02:01:11.457 --> 02:01:12.232
LAURA: Yeah.

02:01:12.232 --> 02:01:13.430
MATT: Yeah, that'll hit.

02:01:13.430 --> 02:01:14.617
LAURA: And then get the rest of them?

02:01:14.617 --> 02:01:15.568
MATT: Yep.

02:01:15.568 --> 02:01:18.884
LAURA: So they have to make a dexterity saving
throw.

02:01:18.884 --> 02:01:24.876
MATT: Okay. This guy fails. What's the DC on it?

02:01:24.876 --> 02:01:27.618
LAURA: That's a good question.

02:01:27.618 --> 02:01:29.322
MATT: It should be at the top of your spell
sheet.

02:01:29.322 --> 02:01:30.212
LAURA: 15?

02:01:30.212 --> 02:01:33.893
MATT: 15? Okay, second guy fails. Guy who's
Hunter's Marked does succeed, so he takes half

02:01:33.893 --> 02:01:34.917
damage on it.

02:01:34.917 --> 02:01:46.376
LAURA: Okay, I'm hitting him initially, so he
takes 2d8. They all take 2d8. 17, 19, plus

02:01:46.376 --> 02:01:51.262
Hunter's Mark on the first guy. They all take 19,
and then the extra guy takes an extra five.

02:01:51.262 --> 02:02:01.827
MATT: Okay. The guy that Trinket swiped just
screams (pained scream) as you can see the

02:02:01.827 --> 02:02:06.630
electricity charging through him, and the wet rain
that hit him has caused it to even give more--

02:02:06.630 --> 02:02:09.264
LAURA: I thought Trinket swiped the Hunter's
Marked guy, though.

02:02:09.264 --> 02:02:10.252
MATT: Did he?

02:02:10.252 --> 02:02:11.192
LAURA: He did.

02:02:11.192 --> 02:02:12.070
MATT: Okay.

02:02:12.070 --> 02:02:13.407
LAURA: I remember you saying that.

02:02:13.407 --> 02:02:18.109
MATT: Then I'll give you that. So the guy who is
Hunter's Marked ends up destroyed, the electricity

02:02:18.109 --> 02:02:22.062
bouncing through his armor. He goes, (moan) and
falls to the ground and crumples over. The other

02:02:22.062 --> 02:02:25.674
two guys get jolted and almost knocked off their
feet. They're both looking really, really rough,

02:02:25.674 --> 02:02:28.883
and they both look at each other (panting) and
just keep running with what little strength they

02:02:28.883 --> 02:02:31.681
have left. You still have a second attack, don't
you?

02:02:31.681 --> 02:02:32.891
LAURA: I do.

02:02:32.891 --> 02:02:34.046
MATT: Go for it.

02:02:34.046 --> 02:02:37.032
LAURA: Okay. Oh, gosh. I'm going to shoot--

02:02:37.032 --> 02:02:39.389
SAM: You're going to shoot people in the back.

02:02:39.389 --> 02:02:42.839
LAURA: No, I'm not going to shoot them in the
back. The guy on the ground, he looks like he's in

02:02:42.874 --> 02:02:44.388
a lot of pain, doesn't he?

02:02:44.388 --> 02:02:46.692
MATT: Oh, he's not going anywhere.

02:02:46.692 --> 02:02:48.379
LAURA: I'm going to put him out of his misery.

02:02:48.379 --> 02:02:50.988
TALIESIN: We don't want people running to report
we're here, though.

02:02:50.988 --> 02:02:53.380
LAURA: Oh, really? So I should get the guys?

02:02:53.380 --> 02:02:55.199
LIAM: Get them, yeah!

02:02:55.199 --> 02:02:56.348
TALIESIN: No witnesses.

02:02:56.348 --> 02:02:57.780
TRAVIS: They might be vampires.

02:02:57.780 --> 02:02:58.775
TALIESIN: They might &lt;i&gt;call&lt;/i&gt; vampires.

02:02:58.775 --> 02:03:02.543
LAURA: Okay. I can't lightning arrow them again,
though.

02:03:02.543 --> 02:03:03.844
MATT: No, it's a bonus action to cast it.

02:03:03.844 --> 02:03:08.486
LAURA: So I'll just regular old attack and I can
only get one of them.

02:03:08.486 --> 02:03:11.551
LIAM: I yell out from the top, "Vex, no
survivors!"

02:03:11.551 --> 02:03:13.047
LAURA: All right, all right!

02:03:13.047 --> 02:03:15.157
MATT: (zoomf) Next arrow nocked.

02:03:15.157 --> 02:03:18.418
LAURA: That's a 19 again.

02:03:18.418 --> 02:03:20.820
MATT: 19 hits. Go ahead and roll damage.

02:03:20.820 --> 02:03:23.541
LAURA: Okay. 13.

02:03:23.541 --> 02:03:29.465
MATT: 13 points of damage. (zoomf) That guy is,
through the back of the head, (zoomf, groan) and

02:03:29.465 --> 02:03:31.101
just slides through the mud for another two feet.

02:03:31.101 --> 02:03:34.382
LAURA: And I act like I have another, that I can
attack him again. I say, "Stop!"

02:03:34.382 --> 02:03:38.685
MATT: Make an intimidation check.

02:03:38.685 --> 02:03:41.425
LIAM and SAM: Come on, girl.

02:03:41.425 --> 02:03:43.090
LAURA: Natural 20!

02:03:43.090 --> 02:03:44.699
(cheering)

02:03:44.699 --> 02:03:46.486
TRAVIS: It is. It is.

02:03:46.486 --> 02:03:51.384
MATT: Watching his friend fall and slide in the
mud, he stops where he stands and looks over his

02:03:51.384 --> 02:03:53.675
shoulder, slowly turning around, shaking.

02:03:53.675 --> 02:03:57.368
LAURA: And I say, "Get inside now."

02:03:57.368 --> 02:04:03.007
MATT: Okay. Next up is Keyleth. Are you going to
do anything?

02:04:03.007 --> 02:04:06.687
MARISHA: Do I kill him or do we keep him?

02:04:06.687 --> 02:04:10.015
SAM: You have to make that decision yourself.

02:04:10.015 --> 02:04:12.366
MARISHA: Is he coming back inside?

02:04:12.366 --> 02:04:13.818
LAURA: He's standing there now.

02:04:13.818 --> 02:04:17.063
MATT: He's currently standing about ten feet
outside in the rain, just (shaky breathing).

02:04:17.063 --> 02:04:19.712
MARISHA: Is that a window I'm up against, behind
me?

02:04:19.712 --> 02:04:23.432
MATT: Actually, no. There is no window to the
front here. It's just a wall.

02:04:23.432 --> 02:04:30.756
MARISHA: I'm just going to go, "Excuse me. Excuse
me, Trinket. Sorry." And I'm going to peek around

02:04:30.756 --> 02:04:34.334
the door and go (shkoof) and Sunbeam him.

02:04:34.334 --> 02:04:36.356
MATT: You're going to Sunbeam?

02:04:36.356 --> 02:04:38.565
MARISHA: That guy. That scared-shitless guy.

02:04:38.565 --> 02:04:42.535
MATT: (laughs) Okay. What level is Sunbeam?

02:04:42.535 --> 02:04:44.080
MARISHA: It's what I just did.

02:04:44.080 --> 02:04:45.574
MATT: What level is Sunbeam?

02:04:45.574 --> 02:04:46.789
MARISHA: Six.

02:04:46.789 --> 02:04:50.136
MATT: How many 6th-level spells per day can you
cast?

02:04:50.136 --> 02:04:51.826
MARISHA: It's a concentration spell.

02:04:51.826 --> 02:04:54.040
MATT: Oh, that's right! You can do it for up to a
minute. Good call.

02:04:54.040 --> 02:04:56.370
SAM: You can do that?

02:04:56.370 --> 02:04:59.105
MARISHA: It's a concentration spell. I can keep
doing it for a minute.

02:04:59.105 --> 02:05:00.753
LAURA: That's so freaking cool!

02:05:00.753 --> 02:05:02.188
MARISHA: Yeah, it's pretty dope.

02:05:02.188 --> 02:05:07.936
SAM: I can do that, too? I didn't know that. Well,
not that spell, but with anything.

02:05:07.936 --> 02:05:12.816
MATT: All right, so constitution save on him.
(laughs) No. Do damage. 12.

02:05:12.816 --> 02:05:25.714
MARISHA: 16. That's 23 plus... 30 damage. Radiant
damage. (lightning noise)

02:05:25.714 --> 02:05:29.544
MATT: As he's standing in the rain, shaking, and
looking at his friend, and looking at you, Keyleth

02:05:29.544 --> 02:05:36.049
steps into frame and goes, (boom). And before he
can go, "Wait!" and there's just this scattering

02:05:36.049 --> 02:05:41.440
of ash that was once was his body. His armor is
left intact and just tumbles to the ground in this

02:05:41.440 --> 02:05:48.011
pile. You see smoke sizzling off the now-heated
armor. There's no sign of his physical body

02:05:48.011 --> 02:05:57.606
anymore, just a smattering of mud that the ash has
now mixed with in the rain outside. Melt with

02:05:57.606 --> 02:05:59.340
prejudice, okay.

02:05:59.340 --> 02:06:00.950
TRAVIS: Got one guy left.

02:06:00.950 --> 02:06:04.038
MATT: Now as you guys are all gathering around,
we'll say from a roleplaying standpoint, as there

02:06:04.038 --> 02:06:08.696
is no real immediate threat to you; there is one
guard left, who has currently one broken ankle and

02:06:08.696 --> 02:06:13.908
one missing lower half of his left leg, on the
ground, looking at you all, hyperventilating and

02:06:13.908 --> 02:06:17.970
trying to back away, like (panting).

02:06:17.970 --> 02:06:19.819
TRAVIS: Time to call the Sandman.

02:06:19.819 --> 02:06:25.858
MARISHA: Since I'm outside on the threshold of the
house, can I see where Scanlan might have lit up

02:06:25.858 --> 02:06:27.541
the other house yet?

02:06:27.541 --> 02:06:29.924
MATT: Make a perception check.

02:06:29.924 --> 02:06:31.611
MARISHA: 17?

02:06:31.611 --> 02:06:42.104
MATT: 17? You can see a little bit of a dark
stream in the distance. You can't tell if it's a

02:06:42.104 --> 02:06:48.165
nearby chimney or if it is the symbol of Scanlan.
The rainstorm does make it a little hard to see,

02:06:48.165 --> 02:06:51.854
at this point, and through the adrenaline pumping
in your system, and the fact that you just

02:06:51.854 --> 02:06:56.802
disintegrated two individuals in a short period of
time. You're also wrestling with the morality of

02:06:56.802 --> 02:07:03.480
that and dealing with what you just did, so your
concentration doesn't enable you to notice

02:07:03.480 --> 02:07:04.654
anything yet.

02:07:04.654 --> 02:07:05.983
MARISHA: Okay.

02:07:05.983 --> 02:07:09.024
TRAVIS: Who's got questions for Peg-Leg over
here?

02:07:09.024 --> 02:07:12.556
LIAM: I do. I hop down off the balcony and walk up
by Grog.

02:07:12.556 --> 02:07:15.846
TALIESIN: I'm going to start exploring the
upstairs.

02:07:15.846 --> 02:07:22.223
MARISHA: I stay standing outside just staring out
into the distance, waiting for Scanlan's cue.

02:07:22.223 --> 02:07:23.385
MATT: Okay.

02:07:23.385 --> 02:07:25.991
SAM: When you see my cue, attack.

02:07:25.991 --> 02:07:27.828
(laughter)

02:07:27.828 --> 02:07:30.404
MARISHA: Yeah, I know. Which is what we were
technically supposed to do.

02:07:30.404 --> 02:07:34.103
LAURA: No, we said we were waiting 30 seconds and
then going in.

02:07:34.103 --> 02:07:35.421
SAM: That was a terrible plan.

02:07:35.421 --> 02:07:37.988
TRAVIS: Greatest plan we've ever had. You were
amazing.

02:07:37.988 --> 02:07:40.127
LAURA: You know what? You were amazing, we killed
them, it was great.

02:07:40.127 --> 02:07:47.432
TRAVIS: I hold my hammer over his other knee and I
go, "Look, we can work on you one limb at a time,

02:07:47.467 --> 02:07:52.660
"or you can be very truthful and my friend can end
it all very, very quickly."

02:07:52.660 --> 02:07:55.377
MATT: (panting) "What do you want?"

02:07:55.425 --> 02:08:03.922
LIAM: There's no question, this is a bad situation
you're in right now. We're not looking for you at

02:08:03.922 --> 02:08:10.709
all. I'm happy to knock you out and leave you in a
closet here and lock it. If you want to help me

02:08:10.761 --> 02:08:18.175
find the Briarwoods, I really want to know where
the Briarwoods are. Not you. Just the people you

02:08:18.175 --> 02:08:19.561
work for.

02:08:19.561 --> 02:08:24.737
MATT: He looks around at the rest of the group,
sees you walk up the stairs. (panting) "They're in

02:08:24.737 --> 02:08:27.317
"the bloody castle, where else would they be?"

02:08:27.317 --> 02:08:32.090
TRAVIS: In? Or under?

02:08:32.090 --> 02:08:34.677
LIAM: That's a good question.

02:08:34.677 --> 02:08:41.676
MATT: "I don't know. I don't know. They spend
equal parts in both, as far as I know."

02:08:41.676 --> 02:08:46.361
LAURA: I peek around my brother and go, "Isn't
there anyone else in the house?"

02:08:46.361 --> 02:08:48.184
MATT: "No."

02:08:48.184 --> 02:08:50.744
LAURA: If you're lying, you'll pay.

02:08:50.744 --> 02:08:53.800
MATT: "All of us who were here, we were waiting
for you."

02:08:53.800 --> 02:08:55.908
LAURA: "Got it." I go upstairs with Percy.

02:08:55.908 --> 02:08:59.896
TALIESIN: That mist is probably following me
around at this point, isn't it?

02:08:59.896 --> 02:09:01.540
MATT: The black smoke, you mean?

02:09:01.540 --> 02:09:02.504
TALIESIN: Yeah.

02:09:02.504 --> 02:09:07.426
MATT: Oh, yeah. The black smoke is slowly trailing
behind you. With each step you take, it licks the

02:09:07.426 --> 02:09:08.654
back of your boots.

02:09:08.654 --> 02:09:10.210
TALIESIN: Oh, boy. Okay.

02:09:10.210 --> 02:09:19.035
LIAM: Is there anything else you can tell me in
regards to back doors or secrets that your bosses

02:09:19.035 --> 02:09:23.435
don't want us to know? I mean, really, this is the
time to talk, right now.

02:09:23.435 --> 02:09:26.407
TRAVIS: Anything you use to identify each other?

02:09:26.407 --> 02:09:33.086
MATT: Go ahead and make an intimidation check.
With advantage because he has--

02:09:33.086 --> 02:09:34.759
SAM and MARISHA: One leg?

02:09:34.759 --> 02:09:38.500
MATT: He's bleeding out right now. Wait, no, he's
not bleeding out. He's bleeding, but it's a

02:09:38.500 --> 02:09:40.038
trickle because of the cauterization.

02:09:40.038 --> 02:09:41.102
LIAM: 21.

02:09:41.102 --> 02:09:55.062
MATT: 21. He gives you a look and says, "Look.
We've all been working for the Briarwoods. They

02:09:55.062 --> 02:10:00.664
"mean well. They have big plans, I know that. I
don't know the details of it. They don't tell us.

02:10:00.664 --> 02:10:09.456
"But we're keeping guard on them. We were supposed
to stop this insurrection. These people. We

02:10:09.456 --> 02:10:17.160
"rounded up folks. We were given basic descriptions
and we hung people against the Sun Tree as a

02:10:17.160 --> 02:10:21.977
"warning. We hoped it wouldn't come to any sort of
conflict, that you would take that as a means that

02:10:21.977 --> 02:10:28.232
"you weren't supposed to be here. But then we all
saw what happened. What happened to Sir Kerrion

02:10:28.315 --> 02:10:33.959
"and his house, and that meant that you were here
and that you meant business, so Tylieri and

02:10:33.959 --> 02:10:42.063
"Vedmeyer, we waited for a signal. And we heard
that you were planning an attack, so we set up

02:10:42.063 --> 02:10:48.627
"guards here and prepared, and sure enough, you
showed up. Which let us know that our contacts are

02:10:48.627 --> 02:10:54.329
"good, and we thought that would be enough. We
didn't realize you'd be walking in with whatever

02:10:54.329 --> 02:10:59.349
"the fuck this thing is. I don't even know what you
are." And he looks genuinely frightened at the

02:10:59.349 --> 02:11:02.515
fact that you, with all of these bolts sticking
out of your body, are still grinning above him.

02:11:02.515 --> 02:11:05.868
"Nothing should have survived that ambush."

02:11:05.868 --> 02:11:08.908
LIAM: Let's back this up a little bit. You hung
people from the Sun Tree?

02:11:08.908 --> 02:11:11.105
MATT: "Yeah, as a warning."

02:11:11.105 --> 02:11:14.894
LIAM: "Where I saw that child?" I slit his
throat.

02:11:14.894 --> 02:11:23.910
MATT: (extended choking sounds) With a wet gurgle,
the life expires from his body, a pool beginning

02:11:23.910 --> 02:11:25.829
to form on the tile below him.

02:11:25.829 --> 02:11:28.172
TRAVIS: Nicely done, Vax.

02:11:28.172 --> 02:11:31.771
LIAM: Piece of shit.

02:11:31.771 --> 02:11:34.421
LAURA: So Percy and I are upstairs alone?

02:11:34.421 --> 02:11:35.396
MATT: Yes.

02:11:35.396 --> 02:11:36.714
TRAVIS: Can I check his body?

02:11:36.714 --> 02:11:42.909
MATT: (laughs) You begin rummaging through the
body. You're keeping an eye out. Make another

02:11:42.909 --> 02:11:43.916
perception check.

02:11:43.916 --> 02:11:48.711
LAURA: I go upstairs, and I get Percy up against a
wall. I turn around and slam him against a wall.

02:11:48.711 --> 02:11:49.710
MATT: Okay.

02:11:49.710 --> 02:11:50.865
SAM: This is sexy.

02:11:50.865 --> 02:11:52.064
MARISHA: 27.

02:11:52.064 --> 02:11:54.163
LAURA: And I look him straight in the eye--

02:11:54.163 --> 02:11:55.474
SAM: And kiss him.

02:11:55.474 --> 02:12:00.365
LAURA: And I say, "Are you all right?"

02:12:00.365 --> 02:12:04.999
TALIESIN: I think so.

02:12:04.999 --> 02:12:07.702
LAURA: Look me in the eye, Percy.

02:12:07.702 --> 02:12:20.676
TALIESIN: I feel cruel, but in control. This is
controllable, at the moment.

02:12:20.676 --> 02:12:24.181
LAURA: "All right." I'm insight-checking him.

02:12:24.181 --> 02:12:26.605
MATT: Go for it. Roll insight.

02:12:26.605 --> 02:12:30.909
LAURA: Shit, just shit. Ten.

02:12:30.909 --> 02:12:32.185
MATT: Ten?

02:12:32.185 --> 02:12:33.662
MARISHA: Fuck.

02:12:33.662 --> 02:12:36.489
MATT: What's your charisma modifier?

02:12:36.489 --> 02:12:38.296
TALIESIN: My charisma modifier is two.

02:12:38.296 --> 02:12:49.904
MATT: Okay. He's hard to read right now. His focus
is divided amongst your intensity and trying to

02:12:49.904 --> 02:12:53.792
answer your question. The pause in his throat
isn't because he's thinking, it's because he

02:12:53.792 --> 02:12:59.737
grasps the words to describe it, but there is a
quiver to it, and you can see his hands are still

02:12:59.737 --> 02:13:03.753
shaking a little bit. And as you look down at his
hands, you can also see the smoke is still slowly

02:13:03.753 --> 02:13:07.146
swirling his ankle.

02:13:07.146 --> 02:13:13.140
TALIESIN: I'm fine, for now. I'll let you know.
You'll know if I'm not.

02:13:13.140 --> 02:13:14.294
LAURA: I will.

02:13:14.294 --> 02:13:15.541
TALIESIN: Yes.

02:13:15.541 --> 02:13:17.756
LAURA: I follow behind him closely.

02:13:17.756 --> 02:13:19.219
TALIESIN: Let's keep looking.

02:13:19.219 --> 02:13:23.316
MATT: Okay. You start seeing, now, the dark plume
of smoke in the distance. Scanlan has apparently

02:13:23.316 --> 02:13:31.711
and effectively set the signal. You also do
notice, as you're looking out, other people have

02:13:31.711 --> 02:13:33.648
left their homes now--

WEBVTT
Kind: captions
Language: en

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.999
MARISHA: And I cast my Skywrite spell-- ew, I just
spit-- and I use the smoke in the distance and as

00:00:08.046 --> 00:00:16.309
it's rising up into the sky, start drawing out the
de Rolo family crest in the smoke.

00:00:16.309 --> 00:00:22.645
MATT: Okay. You begin to take the plume of smoke
and filter into the dark rain clouds and you make

00:00:22.645 --> 00:00:28.295
the smoke go to a thicker, thicker black and take
the next few moments to begin sculpting in the air

00:00:28.338 --> 00:00:32.750
until eventually we have a very well-defined de
Rolo crest now staring down at the entire city of

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:34.008
Whitestone.

00:00:34.008 --> 00:00:37.293
SAM: Oh! Something's happening! Something's
happening in the sky!

00:00:37.293 --> 00:00:38.700
MARISHA: That's me.

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:43.252
SAM: I think it's a magic wielder of some sort.
Something-- I must flee!

00:00:43.252 --> 00:00:46.311
(laughter)

00:00:46.311 --> 00:00:53.239
MATT: All right. Investigation checks from both of
you.

00:00:53.239 --> 00:00:55.071
LAURA: Okay.

00:00:55.071 --> 00:00:57.349
TRAVIS: Did I find anything on Smash-Face?

00:00:57.349 --> 00:00:59.510
LIAM: (sighs) That's what you rolled the last
time.

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:00.523
LAURA: I know!

00:01:00.523 --> 00:01:01.719
TALIESIN: 16.

00:01:01.719 --> 00:01:03.194
LAURA: I've got to put this one away for a while.

00:01:03.194 --> 00:01:04.329
MATT: What did you roll?

00:01:04.329 --> 00:01:06.680
LAURA: I rolled a nine.

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:13.059
MATT: Okay. The two of you take a while upstairs
looking about the rooms. You manage to acquire

00:01:13.128 --> 00:01:20.877
from just some of the local bits of cabinets and
dust, you gather about 230 gold pieces.

00:01:20.877 --> 00:01:22.292
LAURA: 230?

00:01:22.292 --> 00:01:27.191
MATT: Just loose gold pieces that are around.
There is a nice jewelry box that seems to contain

00:01:27.191 --> 00:01:31.314
most of the jewels and gems that this individual
likes.

00:01:31.314 --> 00:01:33.430
LAURA: I'm going to take the whole jewelry box and
sort through it later.

00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:38.539
MATT: Okay. So say a box of Tylieri's jewelry
would be what you've marked down.

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:40.349
TALIESIN: Tylieri family jewels.

00:01:40.349 --> 00:01:42.113
(laughter)

00:01:42.113 --> 00:01:43.431
TALIESIN: That won't be confusing at all.

00:01:43.431 --> 00:01:46.716
MATT: There you go. You do notice, however, that's
all you're able to find for the most part, other than

00:01:46.716 --> 00:01:51.111
some few bits of clothing and outfit. The master
bedroom has no bed.

00:01:51.178 --> 00:01:54.477
LAURA: Does he sleep in a coffin?

00:01:54.477 --> 00:01:58.175
TALIESIN: We're going to finish searching
downstairs and then find the entrance to the--

00:01:58.175 --> 00:01:59.475
MATT: Okay.

00:01:59.475 --> 00:02:02.712
LIAM: I'd like to wind my way up there, as well.

00:02:02.712 --> 00:02:05.390
MATT: Okay, as you make your way up there you
notice them stepping out.

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:08.316
LIAM: Yeah. I'm still curious. I want to go have a
look as well.

00:02:08.316 --> 00:02:09.986
MATT: Go for it. Investigation.

00:02:09.986 --> 00:02:11.477
LAURA: That's better, thank you.

00:02:11.477 --> 00:02:13.307
LIAM: 16.

00:02:13.307 --> 00:02:17.779
MATT: 16? You look through the room. Most
everything of interest has already been picked

00:02:17.779 --> 00:02:24.586
clean. This room also doesn't seem to see much use
other than the clothing that's in there. This room

00:02:24.586 --> 00:02:28.202
is used for dressing and presentational purposes
but other than that, as a bedroom, it's pretty

00:02:28.202 --> 00:02:34.957
useless. As you guys go downstairs, we'll say for
the sake of brevity you take a little bit of time

00:02:34.957 --> 00:02:38.249
to start looking through. You know you're a little
pressed for time because you can feel the energy

00:02:38.249 --> 00:02:41.176
in the town begin to rise and you start hearing
noises. You keeping an eye out?

00:02:41.176 --> 00:02:42.148
MARISHA: Yeah.

00:02:42.148 --> 00:02:44.728
MATT: The people that rush into the rooms are now
rushing back out, some of them wearing leather

00:02:44.728 --> 00:02:49.317
tunics and small bits of armor, their weapons
gathered, and they're forming small bands.

00:02:49.317 --> 00:02:54.808
MARISHA: I come over the speakers once again, the
ear pieces. "I think it's time to go. Whenever you

00:02:54.808 --> 00:02:57.007
"guys are ready, I want to light this bitch up."

00:02:57.007 --> 00:02:59.452
TRAVIS: We need to check all the rooms that go
downstairs first.

00:02:59.452 --> 00:03:00.750
MARISHA: All right, quick.

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:05.756
TRAVIS: "Got an empty house." I run out to the
door to the left. To the uncovered areas.

00:03:05.756 --> 00:03:10.710
MATT: Okay. You go over to this hallway. You
eventually smash the door, doesn't take too long.

00:03:10.710 --> 00:03:19.657
It leads into what looks like a small study or
some sort of an office room. A big blue rug, a

00:03:19.657 --> 00:03:22.318
desk with a chair, some papers strewn about.

00:03:22.318 --> 00:03:24.772
TRAVIS: Can I grab the rug and yank it?

00:03:24.772 --> 00:03:27.239
MATT: Yeah, pull the rug off, reveals a hatch.

00:03:27.239 --> 00:03:29.421
TRAVIS: (excited shouting) I found a hatch!

00:03:29.421 --> 00:03:32.540
LAURA: (cries out in pain) No need to yell!

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:34.628
TRAVIS: Oh sorry. (quieter) I found a hatch.

00:03:34.628 --> 00:03:38.690
TALIESIN: Quick, I just want to do a quick round
of the downstairs room before going to the hatch.

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:43.490
MATT: Okay. Glancing about, you find what looks to
be a general sitting area, a music room, or a

00:03:43.490 --> 00:03:49.769
place where you would host guests. Also in fair disuse.
And then beyond that, you find a room that's

00:03:49.769 --> 00:03:55.494
pretty bland, with a staircase that leads down
into what was once servants' quarters that has

00:03:55.494 --> 00:03:57.209
been converted into a torture room.

00:03:57.209 --> 00:03:58.649
LAURA: Oh, lovely.

00:03:58.649 --> 00:04:04.368
MATT: It's a little nicer in its presentation and
tools than the duergar torture room that you

00:04:04.368 --> 00:04:10.348
encountered in the Underdark, but this looks to be
like Tylieri had a definite interest in

00:04:10.348 --> 00:04:14.970
entertaining unwanted guests.

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:16.685
TALIESIN: Okay.

00:04:16.685 --> 00:04:20.499
TRAVIS: Vax or Vex, will you come check this hatch
for boobies?

00:04:20.499 --> 00:04:22.438
(laughter)

00:04:22.438 --> 00:04:24.236
LIAM: I jog on down.

00:04:24.236 --> 00:04:26.549
MATT: All right, make a perception check.

00:04:26.549 --> 00:04:30.079
LIAM: Yeah. That's a 23.

00:04:30.079 --> 00:04:32.179
MATT: Yeah, it does not appear to be trapped.

00:04:32.179 --> 00:04:33.449
TRAVIS: No boobies.

00:04:33.449 --> 00:04:35.317
LIAM: Okay. You want to open that, big guy?

00:04:35.317 --> 00:04:37.701
TRAVIS: Yeah! (growls)

00:04:37.753 --> 00:04:44.923
MATT: (vroom) The hatch comes up. There is no
ladder; it's just a ten-foot drop down into a

00:04:44.923 --> 00:04:45.879
basement.

00:04:45.879 --> 00:04:47.242
TRAVIS: Okay, I jump.

00:04:47.242 --> 00:04:52.750
MATT: Land down there. A 20 foot by 20 foot room.
It's very musty. However, you do see in the far

00:04:52.750 --> 00:04:57.718
corner there is a pad of fresh earth set up, and
there is a dark box.

00:04:57.718 --> 00:04:59.414
TRAVIS: Um.

00:04:59.414 --> 00:05:00.653
MATT: About eight feet long.

00:05:00.653 --> 00:05:04.090
LIAM: I hear him say "Um," and I jump down, too.
With the Flametongue dagger out for light.

00:05:04.090 --> 00:05:08.456
MATT: Okay. The room lights up a little bit and
you can see across the way there is a not

00:05:08.504 --> 00:05:12.255
super-detailed, but a fairly well-crafted coffin
on the opposite side of the room.

00:05:12.255 --> 00:05:16.196
TRAVIS: Ooh! I bet there's treasure in there!

00:05:16.196 --> 00:05:19.243
LIAM: You might be right. Yeah, let's go have a
look.

00:05:19.303 --> 00:05:21.028
LAURA: Is there treasure? Did you find treasure?

00:05:21.028 --> 00:05:27.407
LIAM: "Hold, please." Perception check the coffin.
That's a 20.

00:05:27.407 --> 00:05:32.249
MATT: Okay. The coffin does not appear to be
trapped?

00:05:32.249 --> 00:05:34.186
TRAVIS: Can I open it?

00:05:34.186 --> 00:05:35.924
MARISHA: He said that with a question mark.

00:05:35.924 --> 00:05:37.645
MATT: It's always fun to do that.

00:05:37.645 --> 00:05:41.659
TRAVIS: Well, should I just smash it?

00:05:41.659 --> 00:05:43.984
LIAM: I really feel like this could be--

00:05:43.984 --> 00:05:45.261
LAURA: Smash it!

00:05:45.261 --> 00:05:50.549
TRAVIS: Three, two. Grog smashes.

00:05:50.549 --> 00:05:53.908
LIAM: I kick it off with the end of my foot.
Little bit. Or try to.

00:05:53.908 --> 00:06:00.116
MATT: Okay. (boof) The lid flies off and then
slams on the ground. A smell hits you that's just

00:06:00.116 --> 00:06:08.678
like musty old mildewed earth. The inside of the
coffin is, it's lined with like a fine purplish

00:06:08.678 --> 00:06:13.748
velvet material, the smell quickly fades. It looks
like there are some small baubles in there,

00:06:13.748 --> 00:06:22.248
keepsakes. There is what looks to be a cape or a
cloak that is laid across the bottom of this for

00:06:22.248 --> 00:06:24.061
comfort.

00:06:24.133 --> 00:06:28.729
LIAM: Roll it up. Put it into my satchel. I'm
going to take a dagger out and I want to cut all

00:06:28.814 --> 00:06:32.428
the way up through that purple velvet. Just see,
just in case.

00:06:32.428 --> 00:06:36.840
MATT: Okay. You cut through the purple velvet.
Rummage through underneath. It appears to be the

00:06:36.840 --> 00:06:39.169
back of the box.

00:06:39.169 --> 00:06:41.723
TALIESIN: I'm going to check his desk upstairs for
anything interesting.

00:06:41.723 --> 00:06:45.339
MATT: Okay. Want to make an investigation check?

00:06:45.339 --> 00:06:47.958
TALIESIN: Natural 20.

00:06:47.958 --> 00:06:56.119
MATT: As you're rummaging through the notes in the
desk, a lot of them are ledgers involving the

00:06:56.119 --> 00:07:00.058
trade in and out of the city. He has his hands
dabbling in elements of the timber trade, elements

00:07:00.058 --> 00:07:08.135
of the actual trade of whitestone. He talks about
the-- and you understand, the reason that

00:07:08.135 --> 00:07:13.735
Whitestone itself is-- the stone that's mined here
is so popular for construction and architecture

00:07:13.735 --> 00:07:22.295
and other elements is the stone that these
mountains are made of, when properly prepared,

00:07:22.295 --> 00:07:28.851
there is a faint bit of residuum that is naturally
ingrained in the rock here. No one really knows

00:07:28.851 --> 00:07:33.972
how it came about, but whatever it is, while it is
not inherently magical, it makes it a little bit

00:07:33.972 --> 00:07:38.876
easier, faster, and cheaper to enchant the stone.
So when it comes to, you know, enchanting a

00:07:38.876 --> 00:07:46.172
teleportation circle permanently somewhere or for
traps or things-- not actual objects but actually

00:07:46.212 --> 00:07:52.081
enchanting anything made of stonework. It's easier
to enchant, and that's why the whitestone of this

00:07:52.081 --> 00:07:58.182
area is sought after and a good trade element. So
there's notes about that. But the stone trade has

00:07:58.182 --> 00:08:03.271
been halted, all stone has continued to be mined,
but it's not being transported.

00:08:03.271 --> 00:08:06.022
TRAVIS: Is the desk made out of the stone?

00:08:06.070 --> 00:08:12.451
MATT: No, there's just notes about it. So all the
whitestone that is being mined is not being

00:08:12.451 --> 00:08:14.731
exported. It's being kept here, somewhere.

00:08:14.731 --> 00:08:15.887
LAURA: They're making something big.

00:08:15.887 --> 00:08:17.149
TALIESIN: They're making something big.

00:08:17.149 --> 00:08:19.562
LIAM: I think we need to get out of here.

00:08:19.562 --> 00:08:21.969
TRAVIS: I was going to ask, are you good with the
coffin?

00:08:21.969 --> 00:08:24.321
LIAM: Yeah.

00:08:24.321 --> 00:08:27.842
TRAVIS: Okay. I smash the shit out of it, in an
effort to see what's underneath.

00:08:27.900 --> 00:08:33.746
MATT: Okay. You take about 30 seconds of extreme
violence against the wooden coffin, killing it

00:08:33.746 --> 00:08:39.347
into chunks and blocks. You get the feeling that
this may have been the place the mist was

00:08:39.347 --> 00:08:50.111
trying to get to. But it did not make its journey.
It got scattered by druid Sunbeam and destroyed,

00:08:50.165 --> 00:08:56.452
and the coffin is left in ruins. You do-- even you,
Grog-- absorb the fact that when a vampire goes to

00:08:56.452 --> 00:09:01.232
mist form, you get the feeling that this is the
home it needs to come to, to try and survive.

00:09:01.322 --> 00:09:03.123
TRAVIS: Not anymore.

00:09:03.123 --> 00:09:04.902
MATT: Not anymore. Not that one.

00:09:04.902 --> 00:09:07.775
MARISHA: Do I see anyone coming?

00:09:07.775 --> 00:09:13.371
MATT: Oh. You see another zombie giant coming up
the way. You can see people attacking it, it's

00:09:13.371 --> 00:09:16.849
just thrashing them about, but this one seems less
bothered by the group and is now moving towards a

00:09:16.849 --> 00:09:21.921
specific area, moving towards the fiery plume
in the distance. They're all gathering in that

00:09:22.010 --> 00:09:22.876
direction.

00:09:22.876 --> 00:09:24.430
MARISHA: But no one seems to be rushing towards
this house?

00:09:24.430 --> 00:09:25.446
MATT: Not at the moment, no.

00:09:25.446 --> 00:09:27.047
TRAVIS: This one's not on fire. Yet.

00:09:27.047 --> 00:09:34.228
MATT: All right, you all gather, you can hear the
rainstorm itself is coming down in sheets. What

00:09:34.263 --> 00:09:35.467
do you want to do?

00:09:35.467 --> 00:09:36.861
TRAVIS: Light this candle!

00:09:36.861 --> 00:09:38.599
LAURA: Should we light this on fire, too?

00:09:38.599 --> 00:09:40.224
TALIESIN: Burn it to the ground.

00:09:40.224 --> 00:09:44.394
MARISHA: "Everyone out." And I start casting a
Flaming Sphere.

00:09:44.394 --> 00:09:45.635
MATT: Okay.

00:09:45.635 --> 00:09:46.876
TRAVIS: We're out by now.

00:09:46.876 --> 00:09:48.002
MARISHA: Everyone out.

00:09:48.002 --> 00:09:51.765
MATT: You guys all step out into the rain
(whooshes) pouring down. What bits of guard blood

00:09:51.765 --> 00:09:53.965
that have been pressed against you washes off.

00:09:53.965 --> 00:09:55.174
TRAVIS: Aw.

00:09:55.174 --> 00:10:01.784
MARISHA: I peek in this foyer. And just (boof),
right in the middle, and take a minute to

00:10:01.784 --> 00:10:03.710
move it all around.

00:10:03.767 --> 00:10:07.643
MATT: A Flaming Sphere begins to corkscrew around
this room, up over the banister, up to the upper

00:10:07.643 --> 00:10:13.227
area, and like an artist, you paint this entire
room with flame until the entire interior of this

00:10:13.227 --> 00:10:18.664
main foyer is just an inferno. You can hear the
flames licking and the light is very bright. You

00:10:18.664 --> 00:10:24.172
end up backing up and you can see people,
unarmored folk in nearby homes that are pressed up

00:10:24.172 --> 00:10:28.851
against their windows watching this happen and
whispering to each other. The children, those that

00:10:28.851 --> 00:10:33.065
are kept guarded and are not part of this
rebellion, they are watching this with smiles.

00:10:33.065 --> 00:10:38.084
MARISHA: Okay, I think that's good enough.
Let's go.

00:10:38.148 --> 00:10:40.109
TALIESIN: Head back to the curiosity shop.

00:10:40.109 --> 00:10:42.204
LAURA: Yeah, sneaky, stealthing.

00:10:42.204 --> 00:10:44.647
MATT: Okay. As you guys run off into the alley
behind--

00:10:44.647 --> 00:10:46.474
LAURA: Pass Without a Trace I cast on all of us.

00:10:46.474 --> 00:10:50.665
MATT: Okay. How many more spells do you have at
that level? Because you used it several times

00:10:50.665 --> 00:10:51.594
today.

00:10:51.594 --> 00:10:55.286
LAURA: Yeah, I'm fine with Pass Without a Trace.
That's a 1st-level. 2nd-level, but I'm fine.

00:10:55.286 --> 00:10:56.736
TALIESIN: Back to the alcove, then?

00:10:56.736 --> 00:11:02.035
MATT: You guys all dart off into the alley under
the cover of the shadows of the storm and the

00:11:02.035 --> 00:11:05.004
rainfall, to head towards the alcove, and we'll go
ahead and take a quick break.

00:11:05.004 --> 00:11:06.535
(cheering)

00:11:06.535 --> 00:11:08.982
MATT: A quick break, I know I always say that, I'm
not going to say five minutes, but.

00:11:08.982 --> 00:11:10.218
SAM: This one's a real quick break.

00:11:10.218 --> 00:11:11.745
MATT: We'll take it real quick because we want to
try and get through as much of the story before we

00:11:11.745 --> 00:11:13.293
get to Critmas.

00:11:13.293 --> 00:11:14.215
LAURA: Critmas!

00:11:14.215 --> 00:11:15.245
LIAM: Critmas! Crimmas.

00:11:15.245 --> 00:11:16.246
TALIESIN: Oh dear god.

00:11:16.246 --> 00:11:17.116
TRAVIS: It's going to be a thing.

00:11:17.116 --> 00:11:18.293
MATT: Which is going to, which is going to take
some time tonight. Be back here in a few minutes

00:11:18.293 --> 00:11:19.275
guys, we'll see you in a sec.

00:11:19.275 --> 00:11:20.046
TRAVIS: Pizza!

00:11:20.046 --> 00:25:30.878
[break]

00:25:30.926 --> 00:25:36.732
MATT: Welcome back. So. Jumping back into the
chaos, the party has scattered back into the

00:25:36.732 --> 00:25:42.191
rainstorm. I would like everyone to make a stealth
check.

00:25:42.191 --> 00:25:43.853
LAURA: Oh, right. Plus ten for everybody.

00:25:43.853 --> 00:25:45.340
MATT: Plus ten.

00:25:45.340 --> 00:25:48.657
LIAM: I did all right.

00:25:48.657 --> 00:25:52.547
TALIESIN: I rolled my disadvantage.

00:25:52.547 --> 00:25:54.819
TRAVIS: Does it matter on a one?

00:25:54.819 --> 00:25:57.180
MATT: All right.

00:25:57.180 --> 00:25:59.554
TRAVIS: Ten?

00:25:59.554 --> 00:26:00.950
MATT: Total ten?

00:26:00.950 --> 00:26:02.946
TRAVIS: Total ten. 11.

00:26:02.946 --> 00:26:04.596
LAURA: 11, technically.

00:26:04.596 --> 00:26:05.841
MATT: Okay.

00:26:05.841 --> 00:26:07.120
LAURA: 29.

00:26:07.120 --> 00:26:08.378
LIAM: 43.

00:26:08.378 --> 00:26:10.542
SAM: I'm not there.

00:26:10.542 --> 00:26:12.252
TRAVIS: 43?

00:26:12.252 --> 00:26:18.001
MATT: Well, you're making your own stealth,
though. You're invisible, so just roll twice.

00:26:18.001 --> 00:26:19.271
SAM: Natural 20.

00:26:19.271 --> 00:26:20.772
MARISHA: 28.

00:26:20.772 --> 00:26:22.102
TALIESIN: 30.

00:26:22.102 --> 00:26:28.743
MATT: Okay. So making up for the bounding chaos
that is Grog throughout the city, you manage to

00:26:28.743 --> 00:26:34.893
still make your way largely as a group stealthed
to-- are you heading to the alcove, you said?

00:26:34.964 --> 00:26:38.620
TALIESIN: That's where we had our little
crash-base set up, right?

00:26:38.620 --> 00:26:46.901
MATT: Correct. All right. You make your way to the
alcove. As you're darting through, you can see in

00:26:46.901 --> 00:26:54.472
the distance small pocketed sounds of yells and
the occasional sound of some sort of large-scale

00:26:54.472 --> 00:27:00.493
crumbling or crashing of wood and stone.
Occasionally, darting past the streets, you see

00:27:00.493 --> 00:27:10.872
militant occupants of Whitestone: armored, rushing
through, shouting orders to each other, some

00:27:10.872 --> 00:27:17.013
coming back wounded and helping their friends
back. The midday rebellion has definitely started,

00:27:17.013 --> 00:27:22.583
and you get the sense that the initial surprise
has been effective, but the longer this runs, the

00:27:22.583 --> 00:27:28.558
longer this wears on, the more and more of a body
count this will be.

00:27:28.558 --> 00:27:33.766
TRAVIS: Seeing the chaos, can I get the Dust of
Tracelessness and start trying to sprinkle it

00:27:33.766 --> 00:27:34.674
behind us?

00:27:34.674 --> 00:27:35.943
MATT: Yeah.

00:27:35.943 --> 00:27:37.669
MARISHA: Guys, we should do something.

00:27:37.669 --> 00:27:39.034
LAURA: I know, we really should.

00:27:39.034 --> 00:27:40.703
SAM: Am I with these guys yet?

00:27:40.703 --> 00:27:47.106
MATT: You have not, but you all meet up back at
the alcove, communicating over your earpieces. You

00:27:47.106 --> 00:27:50.947
make your way to the front of the building. The
doors are closed and locked.

00:27:50.947 --> 00:27:53.642
LIAM: The alcove?

00:27:53.642 --> 00:27:55.822
TRAVIS: Closed and locked?

00:27:55.822 --> 00:27:59.311
LIAM: I'll see about that. I'm going to check the
door.

00:27:59.311 --> 00:28:00.884
MATT: Go for it.

00:28:00.884 --> 00:28:05.204
LIAM: That is ten. 23.

00:28:05.204 --> 00:28:07.924
MATT: Okay. Seems to be a fairly simple lock.

00:28:07.924 --> 00:28:09.029
LIAM: All right.

00:28:09.029 --> 00:28:10.948
TRAVIS: Look for an ambush around. Can we look
around?

00:28:10.948 --> 00:28:12.288
LAURA: Yeah, perceive it?

00:28:12.288 --> 00:28:13.988
TRAVIS: Rooftops? Sides of the building?

00:28:13.988 --> 00:28:15.553
MATT: Make a perception check, guys.

00:28:15.553 --> 00:28:16.804
MARISHA: All of us?

00:28:16.804 --> 00:28:19.352
SAM: Me too?

00:28:19.352 --> 00:28:21.658
MATT: Not you, you haven't gotten there yet.

00:28:21.658 --> 00:28:23.427
LIAM: 20.

00:28:23.427 --> 00:28:24.853
TRAVIS: I actually rolled a 17.

00:28:24.853 --> 00:28:25.873
MARISHA: 12.

00:28:25.873 --> 00:28:26.874
TALIESIN: 24.

00:28:26.874 --> 00:28:27.781
LAURA: 26.

00:28:27.781 --> 00:28:34.803
MATT: Okay. Looking about, there doesn't appear to
be any set ambush or anybody else here. You do

00:28:34.803 --> 00:28:39.405
hear the soft sound of pacing footsteps in the
interior.

00:28:39.405 --> 00:28:43.606
LAURA: Should we knock on the door?

00:28:43.606 --> 00:28:45.014
TRAVIS: Canvass the building.

00:28:45.014 --> 00:28:51.179
LIAM: I can get in there and see who that is. I
can go in, yeah.

00:28:51.287 --> 00:28:53.735
LAURA: They're right on the inside.

00:28:53.735 --> 00:28:56.827
LIAM: I thought it was upstairs, or you said right
on the other side of the door?

00:28:56.827 --> 00:28:58.538
LAURA: Right on the other side of the door.

00:28:58.538 --> 00:29:05.194
MARISHA: Oh, for crying out loud. I push past
them I just go, Jordana! Jordana, it's us!

00:29:05.294 --> 00:29:10.074
MATT: Okay, there's a pause and a voice goes,
"Who's us?"

00:29:10.074 --> 00:29:12.640
LAURA: Oh. Crazy grandma!

00:29:12.640 --> 00:29:16.724
MARISHA: And Vox Machina. (quietly) Does she know
we're called that?

00:29:16.724 --> 00:29:20.487
LAURA: No. I don't know. (louder) Crazy grandma
was staying with you. Crazy peasants.

00:29:20.487 --> 00:29:21.888
MARISHA: Allies.

00:29:21.888 --> 00:29:23.615
MATT: Make a persuasion check.

00:29:23.615 --> 00:29:28.179
MARISHA: Son of a-- nine?

00:29:28.179 --> 00:29:29.832
LAURA: Can I help?

00:29:29.832 --> 00:29:31.986
LAURA AND MARISHA: Crazy grandma!

00:29:31.986 --> 00:29:33.774
MARISHA: Crazy grandma can help!

00:29:33.774 --> 00:29:37.073
MATT: I'll say since you're backing her failure
up, go ahead and make it with disadvantage.

00:29:37.073 --> 00:29:41.781
MARISHA: Hey, you don't have to call it-- that
sounds so sad when you say it like that.

00:29:41.781 --> 00:29:45.006
LAURA: 18.

00:29:45.006 --> 00:29:54.434
MATT: 18. There's a pause. "Crazy grandma? Come
in." You hear the sound of a locking sound and the

00:29:54.434 --> 00:30:00.482
door opens up ever-so-slightly. A very, very dimly
lit interior, there's a small lantern, a hooded

00:30:00.482 --> 00:30:03.790
lantern across the room. Other than that, you see
the shadow of Jordana as she ushers you all in out

00:30:03.843 --> 00:30:05.065
of the rain.

00:30:05.065 --> 00:30:08.785
LAURA: So, hey guess what? It's started.

00:30:08.785 --> 00:30:15.211
MATT: "Yeah, apparently." She closes the door
behind you, looks out the window that has the

00:30:15.211 --> 00:30:22.975
curtains closed and goes, "Okay. So. It's
underway. It's not safe to be here right now."

00:30:22.975 --> 00:30:24.105
LAURA: No.

00:30:24.105 --> 00:30:26.164
MATT: "Did anyone see you come in?"

00:30:26.164 --> 00:30:27.669
LAURA: No, no.

00:30:27.669 --> 00:30:32.872
MATT: "Good. Who are you?"

00:30:32.872 --> 00:30:39.973
LAURA: "Oh. Well." How about Seeming? This whole
time, have we looked like

00:30:40.060 --> 00:30:41.492
crazy peasants during the battle?

00:30:41.492 --> 00:30:42.388
MATT and TRAVIS: No.

00:30:42.388 --> 00:30:43.290
TRAVIS: We dropped it.

00:30:43.290 --> 00:30:44.142
LAURA: We dropped it?

00:30:44.142 --> 00:30:45.260
MATT: You dropped Seeming before all of this.

00:30:45.260 --> 00:30:47.658
LAURA: Okay, just making sure Trinket wasn't a
donkey that killed the--

00:30:47.658 --> 00:30:48.488
MATT: No.

00:30:48.488 --> 00:30:50.057
TALIESIN: That would've been intense and awesome.

00:30:50.057 --> 00:30:52.176
MATT: That would've been amazing. Donkey eating a
vampire head? Aw, man.

00:30:52.176 --> 00:30:57.824
LIAM: This is hard to believe, but this is crazy
grandma.

00:30:57.824 --> 00:31:02.586
LAURA: "I'm crazy grandma." I do a crazy eye thing
just to show her.

00:31:02.586 --> 00:31:05.620
SAM: Am I there, Matt?

00:31:05.620 --> 00:31:09.586
MATT: You've just now gotten to that point, you
see the door closing as you get there.

00:31:09.586 --> 00:31:13.895
SAM: Hello. Hi. How'd it go?

00:31:13.895 --> 00:31:18.890
MARISHA: Good work, by the way! That was awesome!
I mean, I saw the fire, I don't know what you did.

00:31:18.890 --> 00:31:20.978
LAURA: So it went well?

00:31:21.034 --> 00:31:27.345
SAM: I set fire to the place, some shit went down,
dinosaurs were harmed, but I know you got the

00:31:27.345 --> 00:31:29.623
smoke signal and used that to attack.

00:31:29.623 --> 00:31:31.527
MARISHA: The de Rolos have dinosaurs?

00:31:31.527 --> 00:31:35.840
SAM: No, it was me. It's all good, though. I
caused a ruckus, that's all I was supposed to do.

00:31:35.840 --> 00:31:37.028
TRAVIS: That's it, yeah.

00:31:37.028 --> 00:31:38.478
MATT: "What is going on?"

00:31:38.478 --> 00:31:39.577
TRAVIS: Right.

00:31:39.577 --> 00:31:43.568
TALIESIN: We may have just started a revolution.

00:31:43.598 --> 00:31:46.278
MARISHA: Does he look familiar to you?

00:31:46.278 --> 00:31:51.949
LIAM: You don't recognize us, it's not safe to
walk these streets for outsiders, so we were using

00:31:51.949 --> 00:31:58.779
a little bit of trickery. This is us. We're the
same people you were dealing with before.

00:31:58.779 --> 00:32:00.360
TRAVIS: Vox Machina.

00:32:00.360 --> 00:32:02.088
LAURA: We just need to rest.

00:32:02.088 --> 00:32:07.559
MATT: "Okay. You can rest here, but how long?"

00:32:07.559 --> 00:32:09.610
LAURA: Until we're healed, and then we'll go.

00:32:09.610 --> 00:32:11.012
LIAM: Overnight.

00:32:11.012 --> 00:32:13.148
MATT: "All right."

00:32:13.148 --> 00:32:16.250
LAURA: I feel like we should get word out to
somebody, though, because--

00:32:16.250 --> 00:32:18.649
SAM: To what? To hold the revolution?

00:32:18.649 --> 00:32:21.477
LAURA: I feel like everybody's going to die before
we even get to the castle!

00:32:21.477 --> 00:32:24.448
MARISHA: That's the thing. I don't know if this is
the time to rest.

00:32:24.448 --> 00:32:26.459
LAURA: But we don't have any spells.

00:32:26.459 --> 00:32:31.627
MARISHA: I'm okay. We can maybe make do.

00:32:31.627 --> 00:32:34.794
LAURA: I can't make do.

00:32:34.794 --> 00:32:38.019
TRAVIS: You might be cool, but we're fucked.

00:32:38.019 --> 00:32:43.918
TALIESIN: How about we stay here until 4:00, 5:00
in the morning--

00:32:43.918 --> 00:32:45.440
MARISHA: What time is it now?

00:32:45.440 --> 00:32:49.470
MATT: Right now, I'd say you're close to three in
the afternoon.

00:32:49.528 --> 00:32:53.469
LAURA: How do we tell the people to like hold
off?

00:32:53.469 --> 00:32:55.232
SAM: We need to briefly quell the rebellion?

00:32:55.232 --> 00:32:58.841
MARISHA: We started something. We can't stop it
now.

00:32:58.841 --> 00:33:05.282
TALIESIN: We're going to be indoors. It doesn't
matter what time we go to attack the castle.

00:33:05.282 --> 00:33:10.252
SAM: Let's spread word. We can spread word. Let's
find a few--

00:33:10.252 --> 00:33:13.007
LAURA: Can we send off a message?

00:33:13.007 --> 00:33:23.632
MARISHA: We sparked a hope in people. We now have
innocent peasants, people who are not fighters--

00:33:23.632 --> 00:33:28.549
SAM: Can you Skywrite something like "attack
tomorrow" or "hold"?

00:33:28.549 --> 00:33:32.052
LAURA: What if we all take off in separate
directions and we tell all the peasants we find

00:33:32.092 --> 00:33:35.275
that are fighting the time that we're going to
attack?

00:33:35.275 --> 00:33:39.522
TRAVIS: Aren't there a bunch of zombie stone
giants walking around?

00:33:39.522 --> 00:33:43.760
LAURA: Well yeah, we'll have to be sneaky about
it, but we'll spread the rumors around. I look at

00:33:43.840 --> 00:33:45.904
Jordana. Joanna?

00:33:45.904 --> 00:33:47.072
MATT: Jordana.

00:33:47.072 --> 00:33:53.628
LAURA: Jordana. And I say, can you get word out
to people?

00:33:53.628 --> 00:34:01.643
MATT: "To a few, maybe. I don't want to go outside
right now."

00:34:01.643 --> 00:34:03.471
LAURA: I don't blame you, dear.

00:34:03.471 --> 00:34:09.125
TALIESIN: Let's let her stay. I say we just rest
up and we attack tonight.

00:34:09.125 --> 00:34:11.712
TRAVIS: Tonight?

00:34:11.712 --> 00:34:14.474
MARISHA: What if there isn't a town to defend
tonight?

00:34:14.474 --> 00:34:17.943
TRAVIS: Aren't they stronger then?

00:34:17.943 --> 00:34:21.417
TALIESIN: It's going to be indoors, anyway.

00:34:21.417 --> 00:34:26.043
SAM: First of all, it's raining outside. It's
daytime. There's no vampires out there right now,

00:34:26.043 --> 00:34:27.905
right? They don't like water, do they?

00:34:27.905 --> 00:34:30.752
LAURA: No, they don't like running water, in fact
they hate running water!

00:34:30.752 --> 00:34:32.477
I didn't think about that.

00:34:32.477 --> 00:34:35.504
MARISHA: It's a lot of running water, though. I
think they're all right with rain.

00:34:35.504 --> 00:34:37.973
TRAVIS: Yeah, they said a river is what the...
right?

00:34:37.973 --> 00:34:45.710
SAM: I'm sure they don't like it. In any case, the only
thing that our rebels are rebelling against right

00:34:45.745 --> 00:34:51.594
now are six zombie giants, one of whom I'm pretty
sure they killed already. Did I see them?

00:34:51.594 --> 00:34:55.837
MATT: Best you could see, that group was doing
pretty well and was hacking it down. Lost a few of

00:34:55.837 --> 00:34:57.193
their number in the process.

00:34:57.193 --> 00:34:59.272
MARISHA: Did we ever get a count of how many
zombie giants there were?

00:34:59.272 --> 00:35:00.245
SAM: There were six.

00:35:00.245 --> 00:35:03.247
MATT: There were six that you saw while you were
doing your overall flight.

00:35:03.247 --> 00:35:04.967
LAURA: What, so we go out and fight zombie
giants?

00:35:04.967 --> 00:35:07.375
SAM: No, but maybe we could--

00:35:07.375 --> 00:35:14.140
MARISHA: Why not? We are the most capable people
in this town right now.

00:35:14.140 --> 00:35:19.203
LAURA: Well. We could go fight zombie giants and
then tell everybody to wait.

00:35:19.203 --> 00:35:23.154
TRAVIS: Nah, it's going to fuck us. We've got to
rest.

00:35:23.154 --> 00:35:30.546
MARISHA: Why don't we take a short rest, heal up a
bit, get back out there, take down some giants.

00:35:30.546 --> 00:35:32.576
What do you guys say?

00:35:32.576 --> 00:35:36.751
SAM: I admire this fire in your eyes, but it's so
stupid.

00:35:36.751 --> 00:35:39.585
LAURA: What if we run out and tell people to stop
fucking fighting and wait until tomorrow?

00:35:39.585 --> 00:35:44.736
LIAM: They won't. The giants are going to keep
smashing them.

00:35:44.736 --> 00:35:46.889
SAM: What time did he say it was?

00:35:46.889 --> 00:35:51.416
TALIESIN: It's about three. We could just do a
round of the front courtyard and see what's going on.

00:35:51.416 --> 00:35:53.450
LAURA: Fuck! Fine.

00:35:53.450 --> 00:35:55.715
TALIESIN: Try and sleep through the night.

00:35:55.715 --> 00:35:58.143
LAURA: All right. We fight until we absolutely
can't fight anymore.

00:35:58.143 --> 00:36:01.736
TRAVIS: What about the people who absolutely need a
short rest at the minimum stay.

00:36:01.773 --> 00:36:02.986
LIAM: We stay for an hour.

00:36:02.986 --> 00:36:04.798
TALIESIN: We're short-resting right now.

00:36:04.798 --> 00:36:06.125
LIAM: Rest for an hour.

00:36:06.125 --> 00:36:10.005
MARISHA: This is going to go on for a while, but
the longer we wait indoors, the more people are

00:36:10.005 --> 00:36:17.981
going to die, and if we're killing people to try
and save the masses-- which is how I'm justifying

00:36:17.981 --> 00:36:23.276
this whole thing, by the way-- I feel like we
can't leave the masses to their own devices.

00:36:23.276 --> 00:36:28.786
SAM: Wait a second, what about that, what about
that cleric, the religious man that you've talked

00:36:28.786 --> 00:36:32.423
to. Could he get a message out to everybody?
What's his name?

00:36:32.423 --> 00:36:34.016
LAURA: At this point, though, it's chaos.

00:36:34.016 --> 00:36:35.007
TRAVIS: Yeah.

00:36:35.007 --> 00:36:39.063
MARISHA: We literally lit the fire and we can't
stop it now.

00:36:39.063 --> 00:36:40.500
SAM: Archibald? Is that his name?

00:36:40.500 --> 00:36:41.979
TRAVIS: Yeah, they're standing up for themselves.

00:36:41.979 --> 00:36:47.075
TALIESIN: We also, somebody-- there's the point
that somebody is informing on us.

00:36:47.075 --> 00:36:49.016
MARISHA: Someone &lt;i&gt;is&lt;/i&gt; informing on us.

00:36:49.016 --> 00:36:50.447
SAM: What are you talking about, why?

00:36:50.447 --> 00:36:51.956
TALIESIN: They were ready for us. They knew we
were coming.

00:36:51.956 --> 00:36:53.447
SAM: Of course they knew we were coming, we killed
one of their--

00:36:53.447 --> 00:36:56.825
LAURA: They said there was an informant. They said
that there was an informant when we were there.

00:36:56.825 --> 00:36:57.738
TRAVIS: Who did?

00:36:57.738 --> 00:37:03.112
LAURA: That guard. He said our contacts were
right. Our informant was correct. Somebody is

00:37:03.112 --> 00:37:05.931
informing on us. It could be you.

00:37:05.931 --> 00:37:07.676
LIAM: I insight-check this woman.

00:37:07.676 --> 00:37:09.812
MATT: Go ahead and roll insight.

00:37:09.812 --> 00:37:13.152
LIAM: 14.

00:37:13.152 --> 00:37:16.968
LAURA: Can I say it? Because I just said, "It
could be you." Can I do the same thing?

00:37:16.968 --> 00:37:18.927
MATT: Sure, go ahead.

00:37:18.927 --> 00:37:24.306
LAURA: All right. That's terrible. Okay. So.

00:37:24.306 --> 00:37:25.750
SAM: What do you want to know?

00:37:25.750 --> 00:37:30.385
MATT: Best that you can tell, she just looks
genuinely scared and is uncomfortable with your

00:37:30.385 --> 00:37:34.589
presence right now but is letting it happen. She's
still getting over the fact that you guys look

00:37:34.589 --> 00:37:37.869
entirely different than when you first talked to
her about staying here.

00:37:37.869 --> 00:37:41.258
LAURA: Well, short rest and then we head out? We
do some attacks and--

00:37:41.258 --> 00:37:43.787
LIAM: I've never fought a zombie giant before.

00:37:43.787 --> 00:37:46.819
LAURA: No, but everybody else is doing it. Those
peasants are doing it.

00:37:46.819 --> 00:37:50.827
LIAM: That's what I'm saying. Let's see what we're
up against. Let's take a breather and let's go

00:37:50.827 --> 00:37:52.083
pick one off.

00:37:52.083 --> 00:37:58.487
MARISHA: Jordana, do you have any books here on
zombie giants?

00:37:58.487 --> 00:38:09.088
MATT: "For the most part, necromancy is not
studied in this town. At least, we never had to

00:38:09.088 --> 00:38:15.447
"deal with it until recently, and we haven't had
the opportunity to really study since."

00:38:15.447 --> 00:38:22.074
MARISHA: Well, I mean, zombie combined with
giants. We've fought zombies and we've fought

00:38:22.074 --> 00:38:25.939
giants, so I'm assuming it with a vague--

00:38:25.939 --> 00:38:28.080
TRAVIS: What?

00:38:28.080 --> 00:38:29.522
LAURA: We keep our distance.

00:38:29.522 --> 00:38:32.128
TALIESIN: How long does it take to recharge Hex,
by the way?

00:38:32.128 --> 00:38:34.248
MATT: You need a long rest.

00:38:34.248 --> 00:38:37.566
TRAVIS: How many Sunbeam hadoukens do you have
left, Keyleth?

00:38:37.566 --> 00:38:42.109
MARISHA: How many hadoukens? As in Sunbeams? I'm
done on Sunbeams.

00:38:42.109 --> 00:38:43.944
SAM: We need to rest.

00:38:43.944 --> 00:38:45.339
TRAVIS: If we get a short rest, how many do you
get?

00:38:45.339 --> 00:38:46.552
MARISHA: I'm done. None.

00:38:46.552 --> 00:38:47.940
LAURA: We need a long rest to get spells.

00:38:47.940 --> 00:38:52.627
MARISHA: However, if I short rest, I actually
haven't burnt any of my animal forms here recently

00:38:52.627 --> 00:38:59.260
and I can water elemental up, which would also
permanently kill them. So I have other defenses

00:38:59.260 --> 00:39:04.472
that could still take down vampires if we
encounter another one. I'm more concerned about

00:39:04.472 --> 00:39:06.181
these giants right now.

00:39:06.181 --> 00:39:07.990
TRAVIS: That's what I'm talking about. They're
vampires.

00:39:07.990 --> 00:39:10.311
MARISHA: No, they're zombies. They're undead.

00:39:10.311 --> 00:39:11.293
LAURA: They're zombies.

00:39:11.293 --> 00:39:12.305
LIAM: They're undead.

00:39:12.305 --> 00:39:13.860
TRAVIS: Those are two different things, huh?

00:39:13.860 --> 00:39:15.327
MATT: They are two very different things.

00:39:15.327 --> 00:39:16.519
TRAVIS: Grog learns.

00:39:16.519 --> 00:39:18.797
(laughter)

00:39:18.797 --> 00:39:22.613
MATT: All right. So what's the plan?

00:39:22.613 --> 00:39:24.937
LAURA: We short rest and get back out.

00:39:24.937 --> 00:39:27.665
LIAM: We take a short rest and then exterminate.

00:39:27.665 --> 00:39:32.436
SAM: Wait, join the rebellion or ride around town
telling everyone, "quell?"

00:39:32.436 --> 00:39:37.380
MARISHA: We're taking down these damn giants.
These giants are killing people left and right; we

00:39:37.380 --> 00:39:39.858
watched them crush people on our way here.

00:39:39.858 --> 00:39:42.428
TALIESIN: We tell them that they take cover during
the night.

00:39:42.428 --> 00:39:44.292
TRAVIS: I'm going to roll four hit dice.

00:39:44.292 --> 00:39:47.212
MATT: Yeah, you guys go ahead, use your hit dice to
heal up while you're taking your short rest

00:39:47.291 --> 00:39:48.710
for those who've taken damage.

00:39:48.710 --> 00:39:51.122
LAURA: Oh, Trinket. Can you heal Trinket?

00:39:51.202 --> 00:39:52.395
MARISHA: I can.

00:39:52.395 --> 00:39:59.662
LAURA: Heal him so much. Does Trinket get... oh,
he does get hit dice.

00:39:59.662 --> 00:40:05.729
MATT: Trinket technically does not. Trinket
requires--

00:40:05.729 --> 00:40:08.071
LAURA: It says he does. It's written down.

00:40:08.071 --> 00:40:09.031
MATT: Hit dice?

00:40:09.031 --> 00:40:09.788
LAURA: Yeah.

00:40:09.788 --> 00:40:10.728
MATT: Okay.

00:40:10.728 --> 00:40:17.882
TALIESIN: Also, another strange question: what
creates initiative? Initiative is your dexterity

00:40:17.882 --> 00:40:18.870
modifier?

00:40:18.870 --> 00:40:19.911
MATT: Correct.

00:40:19.911 --> 00:40:22.264
TALIESIN: So with me, it's my dexterity modifier.
Plus two.

00:40:22.264 --> 00:40:23.334
MATT: Correct.

00:40:23.334 --> 00:40:26.185
TALIESIN: I'm also currently wearing a Headband of
Initiative, which I'd forgotten about.

00:40:26.185 --> 00:40:27.250
MATT: Which...?

00:40:27.250 --> 00:40:29.025
TALIESIN: Gives me plus two to my initiative.

00:40:29.025 --> 00:40:29.797
MATT: Correct.

00:40:29.797 --> 00:40:31.590
TALIESIN: Oh, dear god almighty. Okay. Thank you.

00:40:31.590 --> 00:40:34.741
MATT: Percy, Percy, Percy.

00:40:34.741 --> 00:40:37.040
TALIESIN: I don't mean to be doing this.

00:40:37.040 --> 00:40:42.500
MATT: No, it's great. Just glad you didn't take the
Alertness feat. Then things would have gotten

00:40:42.555 --> 00:40:43.733
stupid.

00:40:43.733 --> 00:40:45.442
LAURA: Are you healing Trinket?

00:40:45.442 --> 00:40:46.940
MARISHA: How much more does he need?

00:40:46.940 --> 00:40:51.621
LAURA: He's at 36. He needs 24 more.

00:40:51.621 --> 00:40:56.413
TALIESIN: Actually, I'm going to be using the Hat
of Disguise just because it's probably safe. Does

00:40:56.413 --> 00:40:58.838
anybody want a Headband of Initiative?

00:40:58.838 --> 00:41:02.552
LAURA: Yeah. Do you not need it?

00:41:02.552 --> 00:41:05.022
TALIESIN: I can't wear two things on my head.

00:41:05.022 --> 00:41:07.086
LAURA: I don't have anything on my head.

00:41:07.086 --> 00:41:10.702
TALIESIN: So you've got plus two to your
initiative, and I'm losing plus two to my

00:41:10.702 --> 00:41:14.317
initiative. It's called a Headband of Initiative.

00:41:14.317 --> 00:41:16.050
MARISHA: You already have an eight to your
initiative.

00:41:16.050 --> 00:41:17.711
LIAM: It's very mystical.

00:41:17.711 --> 00:41:22.625
TRAVIS: How much time do we have before the sun
that is being blocked by the rainclouds goes

00:41:22.625 --> 00:41:23.512
down?

00:41:23.512 --> 00:41:28.139
MATT: Well, you guys are taking a short rest,
about 30 minutes to an hour, so you have about two

00:41:28.139 --> 00:41:30.080
and a half, three hours before it goes down
entirely.

00:41:30.080 --> 00:41:33.861
TALIESIN: That should give us enough time to do a
quick tour. We already know their walking route,

00:41:33.861 --> 00:41:36.073
and I'm sure that the people are putting up a
fight.

00:41:36.073 --> 00:41:38.073
MARISHA: I'm going to give him a level two Cure
Wounds.

00:41:38.172 --> 00:41:38.953
LAURA: Okay.

00:41:38.953 --> 00:41:40.707
MARISHA: So do 2d8 plus ten.

00:41:40.707 --> 00:41:41.668
LAURA: Me?

00:41:41.668 --> 00:41:44.984
MARISHA: Sure. Me or you. Whoever feels more
comfortable.

00:41:44.984 --> 00:41:46.482
LAURA: I'll do it. It was good.

00:41:46.482 --> 00:41:52.686
MATT: During this rest, if you wanted to
spend some time with that cape--

00:41:52.782 --> 00:41:58.561
LIAM: I do. I'm going to sniff it and shake it
out.

00:41:58.634 --> 00:42:01.591
MATT: For the most part, it doesn't appear to be
enchanted.

00:42:01.641 --> 00:42:05.107
SAM: No, I can sing a Song of Rest for all of us.

00:42:05.107 --> 00:42:07.027
MARISHA and LAURA: Oh, yeah. Do that.

00:42:07.027 --> 00:42:10.632
SAM: It gives us all 1d6. That's pretty weak.

00:42:10.632 --> 00:42:12.873
MARISHA: No, but that's...

00:42:12.873 --> 00:42:15.442
LAURA: No, it's fine. He's got extra hit points;
don't worry about it.

00:42:15.442 --> 00:42:21.442
MARISHA: Well, Song of Rest just happens, right?
Do you get that for free? You might as well, if

00:42:21.442 --> 00:42:22.916
you don't burn anything.

00:42:22.916 --> 00:42:32.401
SAM: Okay. (sings) Health! We need some now.
Health! Not just anybody. Health! You know you

00:42:32.401 --> 00:42:33.552
need someone.

00:42:33.552 --> 00:42:35.239
ALL: (sings) Health!

00:42:35.239 --> 00:42:47.522
MATT: That's not trademarked at all. I love it.
All right, so you guys have rested up. Through the

00:42:47.522 --> 00:42:53.651
rest, you occasionally hear voices run by,
yelling. As you guys get toward the end of your

00:42:53.651 --> 00:43:03.799
rest, you hear the (stomping) large heavy
footfalls heading nearby. (groaning, crash) A

00:43:03.799 --> 00:43:07.577
loud, heavy impact, and you hear some short cheers
outside.

00:43:07.577 --> 00:43:08.640
TRAVIS: Yes!

00:43:08.640 --> 00:43:09.683
LAURA: Yay!

00:43:09.683 --> 00:43:11.964
SAM: Oh, he died. That's two down. Splash two.

00:43:11.964 --> 00:43:17.314
TRAVIS: Right out front, we hear it?

00:43:17.314 --> 00:43:21.517
MATT: Out front, a little ways off. Not
immediately.

00:43:21.517 --> 00:43:23.515
SAM: Do we have horses? We don't have any horses,
do we?

00:43:23.515 --> 00:43:24.249
LAURA: No.

00:43:24.249 --> 00:43:25.142
LIAM: They died.

00:43:25.142 --> 00:43:26.972
MATT: Yeah, they got eaten by harpies.

00:43:26.972 --> 00:43:28.841
TRAVIS: Should we go outside and see how they're
doing?

00:43:28.841 --> 00:43:30.466
TALIESIN: Yeah, let's check it out.

00:43:30.466 --> 00:43:31.904
TRAVIS: We go out front.

00:43:31.904 --> 00:43:33.812
LIAM: Time to kill some giant undead.

00:43:33.812 --> 00:43:35.599
MATT: Okay. Jordana lets you guys out, locks
behind her.

00:43:35.599 --> 00:43:36.793
MARISHA: Do we want to split up?

00:43:36.793 --> 00:43:38.242
TALIESIN: No, let's keep together.

00:43:38.242 --> 00:43:41.045
LAURA: Actually, before we go, I ask, do you have
any holy symbols at all in here?

00:43:41.100 --> 00:43:42.574
MATT: "I'm sorry, no."

00:43:42.574 --> 00:43:43.723
LAURA: Nothing?

00:43:43.723 --> 00:43:49.264
MATT: "No. All those were kept in either of the
two temples here."

00:43:49.264 --> 00:43:51.743
LAURA: Do you have anything magic that could help
me?

00:43:51.743 --> 00:43:53.574
MATT: "I already gave you everything of magic that
I had here."

00:43:53.574 --> 00:43:55.474
LAURA: Oh, right. I forgot we took it.

00:43:55.474 --> 00:43:56.550
MATT: "Sorry."

00:43:56.550 --> 00:43:58.177
LAURA: Shit. All right, thank you.

00:43:58.275 --> 00:44:00.071
TRAVIS: Once we're outside, how far away is that
giant that was felled?

00:44:00.071 --> 00:44:04.999
MATT: As you step outside and look, it's about 60
feet off, near one of the big crossroads near this

00:44:04.999 --> 00:44:09.887
area. And a zombie giant has been completely
felled down, and there are three people now that

00:44:09.887 --> 00:44:13.855
are currently in the process of hacking its head
off just to make sure. It's a group of about seven

00:44:13.855 --> 00:44:18.253
people that live here. They're all looking pretty
messed up, but they're all eager and

00:44:18.253 --> 00:44:24.347
adrenaline-driven, they're all hacking away, then
stopping and taking a breath (breathes heavily).

00:44:24.347 --> 00:44:28.746
You hear in the distance, (thunder crack) bolt of
lightning coming down from the storm, and as it

00:44:28.746 --> 00:44:35.222
echoes, everyone shakes for a second, look at each
other, (cheers) give a cheer of victory. They all

00:44:35.222 --> 00:44:40.725
hop off the body of the zombie giant and begin
darting further in towards the center of the city.

00:44:40.725 --> 00:44:43.935
MARISHA: I look up. Is my de Rolo symbol still in
the sky?

00:44:43.935 --> 00:44:48.244
MATT: It's there. It's dissipating slowly, but
it's still there. It's moved a little bit off-axis

00:44:48.244 --> 00:44:49.786
with the storm.

00:44:49.786 --> 00:44:54.334
TRAVIS: So that's it for the big houses, right?
Just the castle.

00:44:54.334 --> 00:44:55.444
TALIESIN: Just the castle.

00:44:55.444 --> 00:44:59.554
SAM: Except we haven't killed the members of one
of the houses. By the way, my Song of Rest is a d8.

00:44:59.623 --> 00:45:00.725
LAURA: Awesome.

00:45:00.725 --> 00:45:05.847
SAM: But we haven't killed the last one. Now, the
one that you guys killed. What's his name again,

00:45:05.847 --> 00:45:06.714
Tylieri?

00:45:06.714 --> 00:45:07.605
MATT: Tylieri.

00:45:07.605 --> 00:45:08.766
SAM: He was a vampire.

00:45:08.766 --> 00:45:09.806
ALL: Yes.

00:45:09.806 --> 00:45:15.905
SAM: Because Sylas killed him. Right?

00:45:15.905 --> 00:45:17.077
TALIESIN: Yes.

00:45:17.077 --> 00:45:19.415
SAM: And then made him a vampire.

00:45:19.415 --> 00:45:20.524
TALIESIN: One would assume.

00:45:20.524 --> 00:45:22.715
SAM: Didn't he hang him on the Sun Tree?

00:45:22.715 --> 00:45:25.732
LAURA: What? No. What? What are you talking
about?

00:45:25.732 --> 00:45:28.287
SAM: I don't know. Didn't that guy that we
meet...

00:45:28.287 --> 00:45:36.155
MATT: You do recall, actually, when you were
interrogating the driver of the Briarwoods.

00:45:36.155 --> 00:45:46.267
Tylieri was the master of the driver Desmond, who
beat him and subjugated him to various forms of

00:45:46.267 --> 00:45:53.941
torture and abuse before Lord Briarwood took
Desmond and, to try and show extension of faith,

00:45:53.941 --> 00:45:58.468
revealed to Desmond Tylieri hanging from the Sun
Tree. That was true.

00:45:58.468 --> 00:45:59.987
TRAVIS: Wow.

00:46:00.038 --> 00:46:04.369
SAM: And then he became a vampire. Is that where
they're spawning?

00:46:04.369 --> 00:46:10.417
LAURA: No. Maybe he was already a vampire and he
hung him from the tree just to show--

00:46:10.417 --> 00:46:13.438
SAM: That doesn't seem right.

00:46:13.438 --> 00:46:16.580
TALIESIN: Let's head to the Sun Tree, why don't
we?

00:46:16.580 --> 00:46:18.947
LAURA: Let's head that direction.

00:46:18.947 --> 00:46:20.286
TRAVIS: Let's go.

00:46:20.286 --> 00:46:25.396
MARISHA: Something to us about how when people die
in this town. The guy you talked to at the bar?

00:46:25.396 --> 00:46:29.341
SAM: Yes, we talked to a guy at the bar. What
about him?

00:46:29.341 --> 00:46:32.829
MARISHA: He said when people die here they don't
die.

00:46:32.829 --> 00:46:34.648
SAM: Well, yes, we know that, yes.

00:46:34.648 --> 00:46:35.881
LAURA: They come back.

00:46:35.881 --> 00:46:38.995
LIAM: They could be-- yes, that could apply, too.

00:46:38.995 --> 00:46:44.087
MARISHA: I think this whole damn town-- I think
the whole land is cursed. Is what I think.

00:46:44.087 --> 00:46:45.281
TRAVIS: I think that's--

00:46:45.281 --> 00:46:46.687
LAURA: Probably pretty fair.

00:46:46.687 --> 00:46:48.517
TRAVIS: Should we go to the tree?

00:46:48.517 --> 00:46:49.517
LAURA: Sure.

00:46:49.517 --> 00:46:51.022
MARISHA: Why?

00:46:51.022 --> 00:46:53.751
TALIESIN: Just to see--

00:46:53.751 --> 00:46:56.748
LAURA: We'll make our way through the town and
look for giants as we make our way to the tree.

00:46:56.748 --> 00:46:58.919
MARISHA: Let's look for giants. Let's go
giant-hunting.

00:46:58.919 --> 00:47:04.355
MATT: Okay. All right, so from the Alcove, you guys
head in a southwestern motion, keeping off the

00:47:04.423 --> 00:47:11.711
main paths best you can. The main chaos seems to
have died down a little bit in this area of the

00:47:11.711 --> 00:47:19.193
town. You come across another body of a zombie
giant, surrounded by what looks like eight bodies

00:47:19.193 --> 00:47:21.352
of civilians of the town.

00:47:21.352 --> 00:47:23.208
LAURA: Are they all dead, or are they injured?

00:47:23.208 --> 00:47:28.259
MATT: No, they are all very dead. Two of which are
torn in half and just tossed to different sides,

00:47:28.259 --> 00:47:34.881
one appears to be half-eaten, and the rest are
just smashed. But whatever troop was with

00:47:34.881 --> 00:47:38.661
them managed to take the zombie giant down.
Eventually, you make your way to the center of the

00:47:38.721 --> 00:47:46.781
town square where the Sun Tree is and there is,
across the way on the opposite side, what appears

00:47:46.781 --> 00:47:54.526
to be, in mid-struggle, one zombie giant that has
a series of spears or javelins sticking out of its

00:47:54.526 --> 00:47:59.067
torso. It's currently swatting at a group of
individuals that have torches in the rain, still

00:47:59.067 --> 00:48:04.249
trying to get up towards it and push it backward.
The Sun Tree, at a glance-- roll a perception

00:48:04.249 --> 00:48:05.650
check.

00:48:05.650 --> 00:48:06.506
MARISHA: All of us?

00:48:06.506 --> 00:48:07.929
MATT: Yes.

00:48:07.929 --> 00:48:12.480
TALIESIN: One. There's a tree!

00:48:12.480 --> 00:48:13.829
SAM: Four.

00:48:13.829 --> 00:48:15.319
MARISHA: I rolled a 19, so 29?

00:48:15.319 --> 00:48:16.350
MATT: Okay.

00:48:16.350 --> 00:48:17.310
LIAM: 23.

00:48:17.310 --> 00:48:19.139
LAURA: If my passive perception's higher than my
roll--

00:48:19.139 --> 00:48:22.765
MATT: Active perception and passive perception--
passive is more something to keep track when

00:48:22.765 --> 00:48:26.517
you're not actively perceiving. So. Grog?

00:48:26.517 --> 00:48:27.674
TRAVIS: Seven.

00:48:27.674 --> 00:48:33.225
MATT: Okay. Keyleth, you pick this out in the
rain, and it's hard to see, but from this angle,

00:48:33.225 --> 00:48:41.881
you see what looks to be eight ropes, currently,
just dangling free from the Sun Tree.

00:48:41.881 --> 00:48:43.390
TALIESIN: Damn it.

00:48:43.390 --> 00:48:44.590
LAURA: Shit.

00:48:44.590 --> 00:48:46.425
SAM: The tree is the spawning spot.

00:48:46.425 --> 00:48:48.120
LAURA: Really?

00:48:48.120 --> 00:48:50.330
SAM: Or maybe one of them.

00:48:50.330 --> 00:48:52.400
TRAVIS: Or maybe they cut them down.

00:48:52.400 --> 00:48:55.196
SAM: We've got to cut down this tree.

00:48:55.196 --> 00:48:58.201
LAURA: Does it look like the ropes have been cut?

00:48:58.201 --> 00:49:00.111
MATT: You can go closer to inspect it if you
want.

00:49:00.111 --> 00:49:01.190
MARISHA: Yeah.

00:49:01.190 --> 00:49:05.600
MATT: You're hearing in the distance the (roars)
the battle's still raging about 65, 70 feet from

00:49:05.600 --> 00:49:10.837
you. You get up behind the tree and you take the
ropes and inspect it. All the ropes are very

00:49:10.837 --> 00:49:11.909
finely cut.

00:49:11.909 --> 00:49:14.291
LAURA: Oh. They were cut. They cut them down.

00:49:14.291 --> 00:49:15.998
TRAVIS: They cut their dead down.

00:49:15.998 --> 00:49:17.839
MARISHA: Okay, so the nooses are gone.

00:49:17.839 --> 00:49:24.038
MATT: Yeah. And you do see, there are a number.
This close, you can see there are loops of rope

00:49:24.038 --> 00:49:29.337
all over the tree: some very old and weathered and
aged, some of them are torn, some of them are cut,

00:49:29.337 --> 00:49:34.991
but the fresh ones that are the longest currently
and that are placed closest to where the bodies

00:49:34.991 --> 00:49:37.430
were originally there are all very cleanly cut.

00:49:37.430 --> 00:49:41.402
LAURA: Can we spin around and look and see if
there's anything around that looks like-- or look

00:49:41.402 --> 00:49:45.371
at tracking and see if it looks like somebody cut
them down or if they fell on their own?

00:49:45.371 --> 00:49:52.455
MATT: You glance around real fast and you can see
to the south there is still the battle raging

00:49:52.455 --> 00:49:55.965
between the zombie giant and the crew of
individuals, but you look back where you guys were

00:49:55.965 --> 00:50:01.813
from, and you see a large series of shapes
stepping through the rain, coming from the

00:50:01.813 --> 00:50:03.281
direction you guys were.

00:50:03.281 --> 00:50:07.132
LIAM: I think they cut them down just like
Tylieri. I think that this is where they hang them

00:50:07.132 --> 00:50:11.132
to ripen, and then when they're ready they pluck
them off the tree and set them on their way.

00:50:11.132 --> 00:50:16.193
MATT: As you're having this conversation, you,
keeping your eyes forward as he's saying this in

00:50:16.193 --> 00:50:23.182
your ear, you can see, as the light of the town is
slowly beginning to vanish into a sunset--

00:50:23.182 --> 00:50:24.584
MARISHA: Is it still raining?

00:50:24.584 --> 00:50:31.852
MATT: It is still raining. You see ahead of you,
coming from the central roadway into the square of

00:50:31.852 --> 00:50:40.585
the town, what you can only surmise to be anywhere
from 30 to 50 armored skeletal entities that are

00:50:40.585 --> 00:50:42.783
pouring from the north.

00:50:42.783 --> 00:50:44.644
MARISHA: Okay. I climb the Sun Tree.

00:50:44.644 --> 00:50:46.343
SAM: Wait, what? We've got to get out of here!

00:50:46.343 --> 00:50:47.626
MARISHA: I'm climbing the Sun Tree.

00:50:47.626 --> 00:50:51.103
MATT: Climbing the Sun Tree. All right. You guys
see Keyleth scurry up the Sun Tree.

00:50:51.103 --> 00:50:56.808
SAM: I blow my Horn of Fog to create a
smokescreen. I don't know what the fuck she's

00:50:56.808 --> 00:50:57.873
doing.

00:50:57.873 --> 00:51:03.153
MATT: Okay. (foghorn sound) The slow horn-blow
comes out, and this fog begins to fill the area

00:51:03.153 --> 00:51:08.845
between this marching skeletal army and the Sun
Tree where you guys currently are. Looking over

00:51:08.845 --> 00:51:13.324
your shoulder, you can see the zombie giant
finishes smashing the last individual in that

00:51:13.324 --> 00:51:18.074
crew, picks it up and jams it into its jagged
giant teeth.

00:51:18.074 --> 00:51:20.644
MARISHA: So there's a big army coming down,
filtering down a street.

00:51:20.644 --> 00:51:21.991
MATT: Down the street towards you.

00:51:21.991 --> 00:51:23.022
MARISHA: How far away?

00:51:23.022 --> 00:51:24.999
MATT: You can't tell now. There's just fog along
the way.

00:51:24.999 --> 00:51:26.613
MARISHA: I can't tell how far away they are right
now?

00:51:26.613 --> 00:51:27.714
MATT: No, you can't see them.

00:51:27.714 --> 00:51:29.253
MARISHA: I can't see them?

00:51:29.253 --> 00:51:33.588
MATT: No, because Scanlan just created a whole
bunch of fog between the two of you. The moment

00:51:33.588 --> 00:51:37.755
you saw, they may be about a hundred or so feet
from you.

00:51:37.755 --> 00:51:41.215
LIAM: Keyleth, tell us what you're thinking,
because the rest of us are taking this time to go.

00:51:41.215 --> 00:51:44.846
TRAVIS: You engage, they'll follow, we go, we
fight another day, we sleep in the rafters and

00:51:44.846 --> 00:51:46.486
wait until daybreak.

00:51:46.486 --> 00:51:48.103
LIAM: Who are you?

00:51:48.103 --> 00:51:53.391
MARISHA: I might be able to do something.

00:51:53.391 --> 00:51:55.474
LAURA: What is it? Say it!

00:51:55.474 --> 00:52:01.962
MARISHA: I can do a big ice storm or do something
to take all these fuckers out at once.

00:52:01.962 --> 00:52:04.714
TRAVIS: All 30 to 50 of them? Kill them all?

00:52:04.714 --> 00:52:06.330
MARISHA: It's a big range.

00:52:06.330 --> 00:52:08.645
LIAM: No. Keyleth, we've got to go.

00:52:08.645 --> 00:52:15.015
TALIESIN: I say we let her hit them, and we run.

00:52:15.015 --> 00:52:20.145
MARISHA: Scanlan, can you drop the fog just a
bit?

00:52:20.145 --> 00:52:21.727
SAM: Nope, not by magic.

00:52:21.727 --> 00:52:22.975
MATT: He can't control it.

00:52:22.975 --> 00:52:27.115
LAURA: It's on the ground. You can probably see
above it. Fog is low.

00:52:27.115 --> 00:52:32.755
MATT: Well, the fog this creates is a magical fog
that obscures an entire area. If you climbed to

00:52:32.755 --> 00:52:35.695
the very top of the tree, you might be able to get
a little bit of a visual.

00:52:35.695 --> 00:52:38.664
MARISHA: All right, I'm going to climb as high as
I can.

00:52:38.664 --> 00:52:40.525
MATT: Okay, make an athletics check.

00:52:40.525 --> 00:52:42.111
LAURA: I'm going to climb up after her.

00:52:42.111 --> 00:52:43.529
SAM: Oh my god.

00:52:43.529 --> 00:52:49.947
MARISHA: 11. Acrobatics or athletics?

00:52:49.947 --> 00:52:51.023
MATT: Athletics.

00:52:51.023 --> 00:52:53.329
MARISHA: Oh, that's better. 15.

00:52:53.423 --> 00:52:59.948
MATT: 15. Okay. You make your way up to the very
precarious top of the branches. You can feel the

00:52:59.948 --> 00:53:04.565
brittleness of it as the tree itself, its life
force is withered over time and some of it cracks

00:53:04.565 --> 00:53:10.754
and some of the actual bark of the tree twists off
in your grip as you get to the very top. You can look

00:53:10.786 --> 00:53:15.893
just over the bank of fog that Scanlan has created
and you can see beyond that. The number of undead

00:53:15.893 --> 00:53:20.933
from this angle, what was initially like 30
probably pushes closer to about a hundred.

00:53:20.933 --> 00:53:24.957
MARISHA: Okay. And they're like a hundred feet
away?

00:53:24.957 --> 00:53:27.615
MATT: Starting about a hundred feet away, slowly
marching towards you.

00:53:27.701 --> 00:53:33.597
MARISHA: Right where they are, I'm going to start
a little ahead of where they originate, I'm going

00:53:33.645 --> 00:53:39.878
to start making an ice storm. I'm pushing all the
way back to where-- just right down these

00:53:39.878 --> 00:53:40.717
fuckers.

00:53:40.717 --> 00:53:43.616
LIAM: I'm also just trying to stay underneath her
as best I can.

00:53:43.616 --> 00:53:46.564
LAURA: Stop looking up her skirt, brother.

00:53:46.564 --> 00:53:48.397
LIAM: Is she in a skirt?

00:53:48.397 --> 00:53:50.738
SAM: She's been wearing a dress this whole time?

00:53:50.738 --> 00:53:52.376
LIAM: I thought she was covered in leaves.

00:53:52.376 --> 00:53:55.114
TALIESIN: Stop looking up her fig leaf.

00:53:55.114 --> 00:54:00.547
MATT: All right. What's the damage on that? Is it
2d8 bludgeoning and 2d8--

00:54:00.547 --> 00:54:04.138
MARISHA: They take 2d8 bludgeoning damage and 4d6
cold damage.

00:54:04.138 --> 00:54:09.147
MATT: Okay, go ahead and roll for both. And it's a
save for half, right?

00:54:09.147 --> 00:54:10.639
TALIESIN: Inspiration?

00:54:10.639 --> 00:54:13.008
SAM: Oh. Well. I didn't do it.

00:54:13.008 --> 00:54:28.408
MARISHA: 2d8 bludgeoning, that's seven
bludgeoning... 4d6. Not great at all. Four, five,

00:54:28.408 --> 00:54:29.908
six, seven, eight.

00:54:29.908 --> 00:54:34.186
MATT: Total of eight. Eight plus... what was the
other one?

00:54:34.186 --> 00:54:35.418
MARISHA: Seven.

00:54:35.418 --> 00:54:37.030
MATT: Seven, okay.

00:54:37.030 --> 00:54:38.828
MARISHA: And it's difficult terrain.

00:54:38.828 --> 00:54:46.364
MATT: Okay. So the first area. Suddenly you see
some of the clouds above you begin to funnel

00:54:46.364 --> 00:54:52.791
downward, and a few bolts of electricity (crackle)
through it. As the funnel hits, it grows dark, and

00:54:52.791 --> 00:54:58.888
then all of a sudden this cold wind begins to
swirl around it. And with that, the cloud almost

00:54:58.888 --> 00:55:04.790
seems to tear open within itself and a sheet of
jagged ice and sleet begins to pour downward into

00:55:04.790 --> 00:55:12.179
the center of this undead horde. As it does, you
can see probably a good 25, 30 of these are just

00:55:12.179 --> 00:55:19.319
blown apart, bone shards scattered around and you
can see bits of rusted metal weapons and armor

00:55:19.319 --> 00:55:25.259
thrown left and right. The ice then coalesces over
the floor of this area and some of the skeletons

00:55:25.259 --> 00:55:31.540
just slip, but they keep marching forward. It
definitely took a chunk, but as it continues

00:55:31.540 --> 00:55:32.971
pushing forward--

00:55:32.971 --> 00:55:36.949
MARISHA: Now we can run.

00:55:36.949 --> 00:55:41.140
LAURA: Good job. I grab the back of her 
shirt and yank her towards me.

00:55:41.180 --> 00:55:47.263
MATT: You guys make your way down the tree.
As you get to the bottom of the tree, the zombie

00:55:47.341 --> 00:55:55.578
giant has taken notice of the sudden flashing of
light and the movement in the tree and is bounding

00:55:55.578 --> 00:55:57.688
towards the tree after you guys.

00:55:57.688 --> 00:55:59.633
LAURA: Are we running?

00:55:59.633 --> 00:56:01.872
TRAVIS: Are we going to the Alcove or going to the
treeline?

00:56:01.932 --> 00:56:05.240
TALIESIN: I say we go to the treeline, and I say
that you take a couple shots as we're heading--

00:56:05.240 --> 00:56:10.455
LAURA: I'm definitely doing that, yes. I'm going
to shoot at the giant as we're running. Hunter's

00:56:10.455 --> 00:56:11.442
Mark him.

00:56:11.442 --> 00:56:13.512
MATT: Okay, you Hunter's Mark, turning around,
looking at the giant.

00:56:13.512 --> 00:56:17.565
MARISHA: As she says that, I'm going to go ahead
and start casting my Call Lightning spell.

00:56:17.565 --> 00:56:22.649
MATT: Okay. So you land and you cast Call
Lightning. The fog that you created, Scanlan?

00:56:22.649 --> 00:56:23.652
SAM: Yes.

00:56:23.652 --> 00:56:28.794
MATT: Has formed up. You start seeing shapes;
these terrifying skeletal faces begin to appear

00:56:28.794 --> 00:56:35.641
through the fog as the rest of the army begins to
push through. The clouds coalescing above Keyleth

00:56:35.641 --> 00:56:39.611
as you get your Call Lightning ready, you marking
the zombie giant, you guys begin bolting out of

00:56:39.611 --> 00:56:43.841
the way. Trinket comes running up behind you, Vex,
and picks you up onto his back, and you guys begin

00:56:43.841 --> 00:56:46.272
rushing off toward the treeline-- to the west or
the east?

00:56:46.272 --> 00:56:47.560
LAURA: Can I shoot him?

00:56:47.560 --> 00:56:49.812
MARISHA: Yeah, as I turn around, I Call Lightning
on the giant.

00:56:49.812 --> 00:56:52.604
MATT: Okay. Go ahead and roll damage on that.

00:56:52.647 --> 00:56:56.113
MARISHA: And it's cloudy, so I get how much more?

00:56:56.113 --> 00:57:00.287
MATT: I don't know, how much do you get more on
that? Call Lightning would be...

00:57:00.331 --> 00:57:03.201
SAM: While you decide, which way are we going,
Percy? West or east?

00:57:03.201 --> 00:57:08.022
MATT: 3d10. It does an additional d10. It does
4d10.

00:57:08.022 --> 00:57:12.502
LAURA: And I'm going to shoot him through my
Longbow of the Sky Sentinel as we're going away, too.

00:57:12.502 --> 00:57:13.963
MATT: Okay.

00:57:13.963 --> 00:57:21.742
TALIESIN: So the passage to the castle I'm aware
of is to the west, and then the one that Stonefell

00:57:21.742 --> 00:57:24.512
mentioned is to the east?

00:57:24.512 --> 00:57:25.984
TRAVIS: Do we go to the treeline by the castle?

00:57:25.984 --> 00:57:27.463
MATT: No, the one Stonefell mentioned was the
same.

00:57:27.463 --> 00:57:28.313
TALIESIN: Was the same?

00:57:28.313 --> 00:57:30.082
MATT: It wasn't Stonefell, it was Vouk.

00:57:30.082 --> 00:57:31.283
TALIESIN: Yeah, thank you.

00:57:31.283 --> 00:57:33.022
MATT: But yeah. He was referring to the same one.

00:57:33.022 --> 00:57:34.913
TALIESIN: Treeline to the west so that we can
attack first thing.

00:57:34.913 --> 00:57:37.262
LAURA: 22. Twice.

00:57:37.262 --> 00:57:38.462
MATT: 22 hits.

00:57:38.462 --> 00:57:40.062
LAURA: And then three on the last one.

00:57:40.062 --> 00:57:41.202
MATT: Okay, yeah.

00:57:41.202 --> 00:57:43.402
LAURA: Well, it's technically 14 on the last one.

00:57:43.402 --> 00:57:46.324
MATT: For him? Still hits.

00:57:46.324 --> 00:57:47.323
LAURA: Oh, sweet!

00:57:47.323 --> 00:57:50.362
MATT: It's a big target. Big target, lot of hit
points.

00:57:50.362 --> 00:57:55.472
MARISHA: And as she's brewing up her bow, I'm
behind her and just bring down the bolt for 32

00:57:55.472 --> 00:57:56.510
damage.

00:57:56.510 --> 00:58:00.474
MATT: Damn. (lightning sound) You can see the bolt
strikes the front of the zombie giant right as it

00:58:00.474 --> 00:58:05.892
starts swinging after you guys. The bolt hits its
shoulder and blasts a chunk of its shoulder blade

00:58:05.892 --> 00:58:10.773
off. You see bone shards fire behind, and there's
a giant piece of its torso now missing where the

00:58:10.773 --> 00:58:15.212
bolt hit. (groans) Stumbles back onto its back
foot and catches itself, almost toppling over.

00:58:15.212 --> 00:58:17.733
MARISHA: Just start backing up. "Vex?"

00:58:17.733 --> 00:58:22.184
MATT: It starts lumbering forward again as Vex
releases her arrow, which splits into three.

00:58:22.184 --> 00:58:23.476
MARISHA: Vex?

00:58:23.476 --> 00:58:25.823
LAURA: 54 points of damage.

00:58:25.823 --> 00:58:26.775
MARISHA: Kill it!

00:58:26.775 --> 00:58:35.050
MATT: Nice! (impact sounds) All the arrows
blasting into its body, you can see they sink in

00:58:35.050 --> 00:58:40.235
and burst on the inside. There's a little, a dull
glow as this burst of electrical energy hits from

00:58:40.235 --> 00:58:45.944
underneath its sickly zombified flesh. At which
point, there's a slight delay before it (explosion

00:58:45.944 --> 00:58:50.733
sound) bubbles forth and a bit of its internal
liquid just spews out like a boil. You can see

00:58:50.733 --> 00:58:57.260
it's definitely taking damage, and it keeps
pushing forward. Yeah, it's still moving towards

00:58:57.260 --> 00:58:58.284
you guys.

00:58:58.284 --> 00:58:59.565
LIAM: How far away is it?

00:58:59.565 --> 00:59:00.796
TALIESIN: For gods' sakes!

00:59:00.796 --> 00:59:02.758
MATT: It's about ten feet from you guys right
now.

00:59:02.758 --> 00:59:10.764
TALIESIN: I pull out Bad News. I'm shooting it
with Bad News, and I'm going for an aimed shot to

00:59:10.764 --> 00:59:12.405
the legs.

00:59:12.405 --> 00:59:18.204
MATT: Okay. The moment it would take for you to
stop and pull out Bad News, by the way, the moment

00:59:18.204 --> 00:59:21.534
you guys are turning around to attack it, it has
gotten within range to hit, so this is all

00:59:21.534 --> 00:59:25.815
happening simultaneously, so it's going to get two
strikes as you guys get your attacks, as well.

00:59:25.815 --> 00:59:27.226
MARISHA: What are you doing?

00:59:27.226 --> 00:59:29.013
MATT: So. Go ahead and roll your attack.

00:59:29.013 --> 00:59:29.874
LIAM: I did.

00:59:29.874 --> 00:59:30.705
MATT: What did you get?

00:59:30.705 --> 00:59:31.524
LIAM: 27 and an 18.

00:59:31.524 --> 00:59:32.535
MATT: Both hit.

00:59:32.535 --> 00:59:34.775
TALIESIN: I got 28.

00:59:34.775 --> 00:59:41.674
MATT: Okay. And against Percy, that is a 17 and a
20.

00:59:41.674 --> 00:59:44.234
TALIESIN: 17 misses. The 20 hits.

00:59:44.234 --> 00:59:55.573
MATT: Okay. You take 16 points of bludgeoning
damage as its fist comes down and (whack) slams

00:59:55.610 --> 01:00:00.205
into your side just as Bad News fires off and your
daggers go (dagger sounds) towards it.

01:00:00.205 --> 01:00:02.522
LIAM: Keen Dagger, Flametongue, combined 20 hit
points.

01:00:02.594 --> 01:00:05.121
MATT: Okay. Good to know.

01:00:05.121 --> 01:00:09.711
MARISHA: And as soon as I'm able, I'm backing up
and bringing down another lightning bolt.

01:00:09.711 --> 01:00:11.894
LAURA: Well, I've got another attack. That was
just one attack that I did.

01:00:11.894 --> 01:00:13.750
MARISHA: Oh yeah.

01:00:13.750 --> 01:00:16.591
SAM: You need your spells. We need to hide. We
need to run.

01:00:16.591 --> 01:00:21.871
MARISHA: It's okay, this is a concentration spell.
I can keep doing it. I'm not blowing spells on it.

01:00:21.871 --> 01:00:25.490
TALIESIN: 22 points of damage, plus he's knocked
prone.

01:00:25.490 --> 01:00:28.120
MATT: Okay. Easy enough. Through the daggers--

01:00:28.120 --> 01:00:30.054
TALIESIN: Oh, he can make a con saving throw,
though.

01:00:30.054 --> 01:00:36.252
MATT: It doesn't matter. It still manages to keep
its zombie form, though it seems like every single

01:00:36.252 --> 01:00:40.301
hit you're taking chunks off its body, but it
continues to push through the damage until

01:00:40.301 --> 01:00:45.170
eventually it swings at you with the hit, Bad News
goes off as it blasts through the center of its

01:00:45.170 --> 01:00:49.440
torso and takes out the back of its spine. It
can't keep its physical form together, and as its

01:00:49.440 --> 01:00:53.351
body lunges forward, you throw both of your
daggers, which go (thoonk thoonk) into each of its

01:00:53.351 --> 01:00:59.032
eyes. It falls forward. The torso seems to roll on
impact and come after you like a slow-moving

01:00:59.032 --> 01:01:03.133
boulder for a few feet, but since you're all
moving forward, you manage to outrun it, just

01:01:03.133 --> 01:01:07.096
barely keeping out of the way. The legs
walk on their own for two more steps before it

01:01:07.193 --> 01:01:14.255
just falls forward into the mud, relieving all its
intestines into the rain-soaked ground.

01:01:14.255 --> 01:01:15.777
SAM: Let's get out of here!

01:01:15.777 --> 01:01:16.981
MARISHA: Go, go, go. Run!

01:01:16.981 --> 01:01:18.482
LAURA: Pass Without a Trace!

01:01:18.482 --> 01:01:20.112
TRAVIS: Aggressive flower girl.

01:01:20.112 --> 01:01:23.372
MARISHA: Do I see any other-- as we're running
through--

01:01:23.372 --> 01:01:24.755
LAURA: Just run, Keyleth!

01:01:24.755 --> 01:01:26.814
LIAM: I grab Keyleth by the arm and I just pull
and run.

01:01:26.814 --> 01:01:29.752
MATT: You guys go running back and as you're
looking over your shoulder you can see the

01:01:29.752 --> 01:01:36.302
skeletal army swarming the center of the square
and pouring into the streets. It seems that the

01:01:36.302 --> 01:01:42.472
Briarwoods had their own reserve anti-riot
campaign at the ready.

01:01:42.472 --> 01:01:44.643
LAURA: Oh, are they going to take out everybody?

01:01:44.643 --> 01:01:46.232
MARISHA: We can't go, we can't go!

01:01:46.232 --> 01:01:49.168
SAM: We have to go. We have nothing left.

01:01:49.168 --> 01:01:51.650
MATT: And with that, we're going to conclude
tonight's session.

01:01:51.650 --> 01:01:53.313
(groaning)

01:01:53.313 --> 01:01:58.132
MATT: We'll be returning next week on that note.

01:01:58.132 --> 01:02:02.723
TRAVIS: (laughs) You son of a bitch, I love it.

01:02:02.723 --> 01:02:08.531
MATT: All right, so we're going to take a little break
here while we set up for Critmas. Quick one, very

01:02:08.560 --> 01:02:13.101
quick, we'll be back here in just a few minutes,
for those who want to hang in and watch how

01:02:13.101 --> 01:02:15.152
ridiculously amazing this community is.

01:02:15.152 --> 01:02:17.744
LAURA: Oh my gosh. There's like, there's a lot.

01:02:17.744 --> 01:02:19.402
MARISHA: Yeah, you guys are crazy.

01:02:19.402 --> 01:02:21.374
LIAM: Buckle up!

01:02:21.374 --> 01:02:24.043
MATT: All right, quick break. See you in a
second.
