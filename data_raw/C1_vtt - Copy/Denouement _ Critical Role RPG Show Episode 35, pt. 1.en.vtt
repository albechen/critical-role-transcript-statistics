00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.312
MATT: Hello and welcome to Critical Role, the game
where a bunch of us nerdy-ass voice actors sit

00:00:04.312 --> 00:00:10.425
around and play Dungeons and Dragons. Tonight we
have an interesting continuation of the story;

00:00:10.425 --> 00:00:14.286
we'll be picking up here shortly. First and
foremost, we're going to get ourselves through

00:00:14.286 --> 00:00:19.651
a few announcements and some cool things you guys
should know. So, first and foremost for returning

00:00:19.683 --> 00:00:25.095
fans and people watching the show, thank you, and
if this your first time live or your first time

00:00:25.095 --> 00:00:32.084
seeing the show, hopefully you're not too confused
and welcome as well. First and foremost, for those

00:00:32.084 --> 00:00:36.255
who haven't seen it yet we've been doing Spotify
playlists for each of the players and the

00:00:36.255 --> 00:00:41.268
characters; we just finished that whole sequence
with mine that went up today, so if you haven't

00:00:41.268 --> 00:00:45.517
had a chance to check it out you can go ahead and
check it out. I did a playlist based around many

00:00:45.517 --> 00:00:51.581
of the NPCs in the world of Exandria that Vox
Machina have come across and just a couple little

00:00:51.581 --> 00:00:56.882
tidbits about their characters and their
backgrounds and one song per NPC that rounds out

00:00:56.882 --> 00:01:01.973
their personalities, so check it out if you're
interested. Hopefully you like it and you also get

00:01:01.973 --> 00:01:04.052
an eye into my taste in music, too.

00:01:04.052 --> 00:01:08.316
SAM: A lot of classic rock!

00:01:08.316 --> 00:01:11.885
MATT: We had a new comic come up this week, didn't
we?

00:01:11.885 --> 00:01:12.830
TALIESIN: We have a new comic!

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:13.760
MARISHA: New comic!

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:16.384
LIAM: Drink!

00:01:16.384 --> 00:01:22.104
MARISHA: Yes, based off of real events that
happened in real life and in game.

00:01:22.104 --> 00:01:23.777
SAM: That's true.

00:01:23.777 --> 00:01:26.256
TALIESIN: Who won that drinking contest in real
life?

00:01:26.256 --> 00:01:27.253
LAURA: Ashley.

00:01:27.253 --> 00:01:28.278
TALIESIN: I was trying to remember.

00:01:28.278 --> 00:01:29.325
MARISHA: I think Ashley.

00:01:29.325 --> 00:01:30.628
TALIESIN: Who lost that drinking contest, if I
recall?

00:01:30.628 --> 00:01:31.725
MATT: Laura.

00:01:31.725 --> 00:01:33.058
(laughter)

00:01:33.058 --> 00:01:34.512
LAURA: I lost so hard.

00:01:34.512 --> 00:01:39.723
MARISHA: But the pitchers is actually how you have
to do it, so, but we just didn't post-- it's like

00:01:39.762 --> 00:01:45.950
the rules are for alcohol commercials. As long as
you're not actually physically drinking it,

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:46.940
it's fine.

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:49.925
MATT: I will say, Laura, you plop down drunkenly
very adorably.

00:01:49.925 --> 00:01:50.973
LAURA: Shush, you.

00:01:50.973 --> 00:01:53.384
(laughter)

00:01:53.384 --> 00:01:55.387
LAURA: I don't know what you're talking about.

00:01:55.387 --> 00:02:03.106
MATT: All right, cool, so go check out the comic,
drawn by our wonderful artist Wendy, and this is

00:02:03.106 --> 00:02:08.099
all leading into a retelling of the Winter's Crest
festival, the first one that Vox Machina had in

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:16.119
the city of Westrun, so go check it out and see.
Other updates: my class update also went up

00:02:16.119 --> 00:02:22.159
yesterday and it was actually just updated before
the show tonight with a couple of fixes to some of

00:02:22.159 --> 00:02:25.435
the text and stuff, so if you've already
downloaded, go to the website and download the

00:02:25.435 --> 00:02:30.226
newest one, it's 1.2. It's called the Bloodhunter;
it's a retool of the Witchhunter, taking it away

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:36.037
from the promotional aspect that it was tied to
back in October. I was able to retool it and make

00:02:36.037 --> 00:02:40.176
it something a little more wholly my own and my
own unique design as opposed to being tied to the

00:02:40.176 --> 00:02:45.060
preexisting IP. So it's got some cool abilities. I
hope you like it. If you feel like running it in

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:46.824
your game or allowing your players to do so, have
fun.

00:02:46.824 --> 00:02:49.051
MARISHA: And it's got the seal of approval.

00:02:49.051 --> 00:02:55.098
MATT: Not the seal of approval, I would say. I did
manage to have some wonderful feedback from Mike

00:02:55.098 --> 00:02:58.560
Mearls from Dungeons and Dragons at Wizards of the
Coast. He was very very sweet enough to give me

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:03.657
notes and ideas when I was going through the
redesign process so thank you tremendously Mike

00:03:03.657 --> 00:03:08.515
for that. It's still my real first homebrew class
that I've ever designed, so it's far from perfect

00:03:08.515 --> 00:03:13.450
and there'll be adjustments as time goes on and
play tests and balance things come through, so be

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:22.306
gentle. But it should at least be fun. Let's see.
Marisha! You wanted to talk about Super Power Beat

00:03:22.306 --> 00:03:23.427
Down real fast.

00:03:23.427 --> 00:03:27.877
MARISHA: Yeah, there was a new Super Power Beat
Down that came out today where we are challenging

00:03:27.877 --> 00:03:31.575
Darth Maul versus Spider-man. Because, why not?

00:03:31.575 --> 00:03:33.382
TALIESIN: Because it's Christmas.

00:03:33.382 --> 00:03:35.552
MATT: (laughing) Because it's Christmas?

00:03:35.552 --> 00:03:42.939
MARISHA: Why not. But you should check it out
because we have a very fun cameo by someone who I

00:03:42.939 --> 00:03:44.108
don't want to spoil.

00:03:44.108 --> 00:03:45.587
SAM: (laughs) It's not me!

00:03:45.587 --> 00:03:46.960
MARISHA: It's not Sam.

00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:48.243
SAM: No, it's really not.

00:03:48.243 --> 00:03:57.038
MARISHA: No, it's really not. But his name might
rhyme with Pan Me.

00:03:57.038 --> 00:04:02.109
SAM: Bahn mi, the Vietnamese sandwich that you can
get in many places?

00:04:02.109 --> 00:04:07.165
MARISHA: Yes. It rhymes with bahn me. No, it
doesn't, actually.

00:04:07.165 --> 00:04:09.667
LIAM: You got Ang Lee to be in your short?!

00:04:09.667 --> 00:04:10.829
SAM: Ang Lee!

00:04:10.829 --> 00:04:12.035
MATT: That's crazy!

00:04:12.035 --> 00:04:14.846
TALIESIN: I'm really lost right now. I'm genuinely
lost.

00:04:14.846 --> 00:04:16.873
MARISHA: The chat room gets it, don't you?

00:04:16.873 --> 00:04:18.114
TRAVIS: Pan Me?

00:04:18.114 --> 00:04:19.241
LAURA: That's major!

00:04:19.241 --> 00:04:21.367
MARISHA: His name... yeah! There's a cameo in
there.

00:04:21.367 --> 00:04:24.917
LIAM: He directed The Hulk! And The Ice Storm!

00:04:24.917 --> 00:04:26.249
MATT: The not-good one!

00:04:26.249 --> 00:04:29.435
ALL: Oh...

00:04:29.435 --> 00:04:31.136
TALIESIN: And now that cameo's being edited out.

00:04:31.136 --> 00:04:32.155
MATT: Just saying.

00:04:32.155 --> 00:04:36.924
LAURA: You'll never work on broken... what is it?
Mountain? Brokeback Mountain II? That was a

00:04:36.924 --> 00:04:38.416
horrible joke. Just forget I said that.

00:04:38.416 --> 00:04:40.037
(laughter)

00:04:40.037 --> 00:04:44.332
MATT: No. If the internet's been watching--

00:04:44.332 --> 00:04:45.844
ASHLEY: I thought it was funny.

00:04:45.844 --> 00:04:48.482
MATT: If the internet's been paying attention,
they'll know that I've practically already been in

00:04:48.482 --> 00:04:49.828
Brokeback Mountain II.

00:04:49.828 --> 00:04:51.522
TALIESIN: Speaking of which, you're in a thing
this week.

00:04:51.522 --> 00:04:52.745
MATT: Oh yeah.

00:04:52.745 --> 00:04:54.089
LIAM: Get it, girl!

00:04:54.089 --> 00:05:01.795
MATT: So, on Hulu, there's the new Rocket Jump
series that went up, and our dear friend Ashly

00:05:01.795 --> 00:05:07.701
Burch, a very talented girl, wrote and directed a
very awesome, really hilarious sketch that is a

00:05:07.801 --> 00:05:14.376
loving parody of fanfiction on the internet and
fan cultures colliding. And I had the pleasure of

00:05:14.376 --> 00:05:20.944
briefly having a cameo as Loki in it, and I'm
not going to spoil the ending, because it's a

00:05:20.944 --> 00:05:22.206
whopper.

00:05:22.206 --> 00:05:24.415
(laughter)

00:05:24.415 --> 00:05:26.819
LIAM: It's a happy ending.

00:05:26.819 --> 00:05:34.510
MATT: It's a very happy ending with multiple happy
endings. All over. So, you can go check that out.

00:05:34.510 --> 00:05:36.239
And I'm sorry.

00:05:36.239 --> 00:05:38.518
MARISHA: "And I'm sorry."

00:05:38.518 --> 00:05:39.642
MATT: And I'm sorry.

00:05:39.642 --> 00:05:40.929
LIAM: You're welcome.

00:05:40.929 --> 00:05:44.813
MATT: (laughs) Depending on who I'm talking to.
Another quick awesome announcement, this is huge:

00:05:44.813 --> 00:05:47.901
Ashley, can you please wear headphones, a slight
echo is coming through?

00:05:47.901 --> 00:05:49.446
ASHLEY: Yeah.

00:05:49.446 --> 00:05:58.112
MATT: Thank you. So, if you guys could all help
her do that, that would be great. Next week is our

00:05:58.112 --> 00:06:00.354
last episode before the holiday break.

00:06:00.354 --> 00:06:01.540
LAURA: Ever.

00:06:01.540 --> 00:06:05.118
MATT: No, don't even say that! We've already had
that rumor go around apparently, like, "Oh my god,

00:06:05.118 --> 00:06:07.519
is the show going to end forever?" I'm like, no!

00:06:07.519 --> 00:06:10.283
LIAM: As long as they'll let us do this, we're
going to do it.

00:06:10.283 --> 00:06:11.170
MATT: Yeah.

00:06:11.170 --> 00:06:12.864
SAM: Or as long as Matt doesn't kill us all.

00:06:12.864 --> 00:06:23.765
MATT: Oh, we'll just reroll characters. Yeah, and
we'll all play Rifts. It'll be good. No. So, next

00:06:23.765 --> 00:06:28.552
week will be our last episode before the break.
We'll be returning on January 7th. But in the

00:06:28.552 --> 00:06:33.135
meantime, everyone will be enjoying time with
their families and such. Enjoy your two week break

00:06:33.135 --> 00:06:40.139
off. I know we will. Also, once again just a
reminder, we have our Critmas sweaters available.

00:06:40.139 --> 00:06:43.722
SAM: I'm modeling one right now!

00:06:43.722 --> 00:06:46.723
LAURA: Also available in green.

00:06:46.723 --> 00:06:55.620
SAM: It's lovely. The fabric is soft. It fits
snugly and warmly... but not too warm. I think...

00:06:55.620 --> 00:06:58.093
I would pay 50 dollars for a sweater like this.

00:06:58.093 --> 00:07:00.487
TALIESIN: You look like you're snugly in there, I
must say.

00:07:00.487 --> 00:07:02.575
LIAM: It's got your poops right on it.

00:07:02.575 --> 00:07:05.380
SAM: It keeps my poops nice and snug.

00:07:05.380 --> 00:07:06.851
LAURA: Poop through a cone.

00:07:06.851 --> 00:07:08.752
SAM: It's got two pockets for two poops.

00:07:08.752 --> 00:07:18.510
MATT: You can't beat promotion like this, folks.
Check out the Geek and Sundry website. They have

00:07:18.510 --> 00:07:21.674
all of the awesome stuff up there so you can get
those last-minute presents for your friends and

00:07:21.674 --> 00:07:26.464
family who hopefully haven't seen the show so
they're really confused what you get them.

00:07:26.506 --> 00:07:29.132
MARISHA: Yeah, like, "Dude! I got you something I
like!"

00:07:29.132 --> 00:07:33.875
MATT: Yeah, hey, works out well. It's the season
of the Homer bowling ball. Marisha, you want to

00:07:33.875 --> 00:07:35.996
talk about the Boonzy Arts candles?

00:07:35.996 --> 00:07:43.211
MARISHA: Oh, yes, the Boonzy Arts candles. I meant
to grab those. The D&amp;amp;D-related candles that I

00:07:43.211 --> 00:07:50.930
plugged back when we were doing the Slayer's Take
episodes forever ago. They had a Kickstarter. They

00:07:50.930 --> 00:07:57.594
are out now and you can buy them on their website
at BoonzyArts.com. Yes, and we have a set that we

00:07:57.594 --> 00:08:04.263
were going to be doing in a giveaway as well that
she delivered that I'll find during break.

00:08:04.263 --> 00:08:10.271
MATT: There you have it. Also as a reminder, we
have Wyrmwood Gaming that does the really awesome

00:08:10.271 --> 00:08:13.740
high-quality gamer stuff.

00:08:13.740 --> 00:08:21.388
LIAM: An excellent Christmas gift, or Critmas
gift, a Wyrmwood Gaming box would be. If you use

00:08:21.422 --> 00:08:28.592
the code CritRole, you'll get free shipping. And
they are lovely and fancy and they will make a

00:08:28.592 --> 00:08:30.175
nice, handsome Christmas present.

00:08:30.175 --> 00:08:31.911
TRAVIS: And they will poop in your box for the
delivery.

00:08:31.911 --> 00:08:33.736
MATT: You have to request that.

00:08:33.736 --> 00:08:35.687
TALIESIN: That was only you.

00:08:35.687 --> 00:08:36.870
LIAM: Sam will do that.

00:08:36.870 --> 00:08:39.626
SAM: I will do that if you request.

00:08:39.626 --> 00:08:42.505
ASHLEY: Oh man, I can't wait to get mine!

00:08:42.505 --> 00:08:44.157
(laughter)

00:08:44.157 --> 00:08:45.955
ASHLEY: Including the poo.

00:08:45.955 --> 00:08:53.516
SAM: Ashley, we can see the sparkle on your eyes
is messing with the cameras. Can you also wear

00:08:53.516 --> 00:08:57.366
something over your eyes? So, headphones and also
cover your eyes.

00:08:57.366 --> 00:09:02.518
ASHLEY: (laughs) I don't know.

00:09:02.518 --> 00:09:04.953
TRAVIS: No promises, you guys.

00:09:04.953 --> 00:09:06.898
ASHLEY: I didn't have a comeback for that one.

00:09:06.898 --> 00:09:14.756
MATT: Couple of last things. The Critter's
Guide to Critmas is going up tomorrow, isn't it?

00:09:14.756 --> 00:09:16.304
MARISHA: Tomorrow. At 6AM.

00:09:16.304 --> 00:09:17.342
MATT: 6AM.

00:09:17.342 --> 00:09:18.974
SAM: You're going to wake up for that?

00:09:18.974 --> 00:09:30.465
MARISHA: Like the Macy's Day Parade. No. But it'll
be up that early. Now that we've had an awesome

00:09:30.465 --> 00:09:38.283
year of amazing Critmases, we've had a few ideas
that the Critters actually gave us to focus the

00:09:38.283 --> 00:09:41.365
idea of Critmas a little bit.

00:09:41.365 --> 00:09:44.001
TALIESIN: The spirit of Critmas.

00:09:44.001 --> 00:09:46.786
SAM: On what it originally was, Jesus Crit.

00:09:46.786 --> 00:09:49.023
(laughter)

00:09:49.023 --> 00:09:50.922
SAM: That's what the holiday was always about.

00:09:50.922 --> 00:09:52.050
TRAVIS: No.

00:09:52.050 --> 00:09:53.835
SAM: And now we're getting it back to Jesus Crit.

00:09:53.835 --> 00:09:57.682
(laughter)

00:09:57.682 --> 00:09:59.211
SAM: No?

00:09:59.211 --> 00:10:01.281
MARISHA: Yep. We'll leave it at that.

00:10:01.281 --> 00:10:03.929
TRAVIS: You can't do any better that.

00:10:03.929 --> 00:10:12.739
MATT: So, tomorrow you'll be able to read this
really inaccurate description by Sam Riegel-- the

00:10:12.782 --> 00:10:17.171
Critter's Guide to Critmas. And last but not
least, if anybody has any other announcements or

00:10:17.171 --> 00:10:22.116
projects coming up that they'd like to mention.
There's a Wii U game that just came out called

00:10:22.116 --> 00:10:25.281
Xenoblade Chronicles X where I voice a character
named Lao, that just came out recently, so if

00:10:25.281 --> 00:10:32.072
you're a fan of those awesome RPGs, I will be
really subdued and arrogant in your face.

00:10:32.072 --> 00:10:34.989
TRAVIS: Subdued and arrogant.

00:10:34.989 --> 00:10:36.421
TALIESIN: We get that for free.

00:10:36.421 --> 00:10:39.921
MATT: Exactly. Every week. Anything else, guys? We
good?

00:10:39.921 --> 00:10:41.182
TALIESIN: Yeah.

00:10:41.182 --> 00:10:43.643
MATT: All righty. Now let's get down to the nitty
gritty.

00:10:43.643 --> 00:10:46.829
(sound effect noises)

00:10:46.829 --> 00:10:48.810
TRAVIS: Was that "Who Wants to be a Millionaire?"

00:10:48.810 --> 00:10:51.084
SAM: Yeah. Of course. It's got to be, right?

00:10:51.084 --> 00:10:59.910
MATT: The lights swish. All right. So, to get you
guys up to speed as fast as I can-- this is a

00:10:59.910 --> 00:11:05.823
really long arc. The Briarwoods, being a family
that five years ago took over the city of

00:11:05.823 --> 00:11:11.983
Whitestone, where Percy hails from, murdered his
family, and he barely escaped with his life, years

00:11:11.983 --> 00:11:20.709
later, came back into the folds of Vox Machina's
existence, and it was decided to go ahead and hunt

00:11:20.709 --> 00:11:25.554
them down and save the city of Whitestone. Upon
arriving, they began to stir rebellion in the town

00:11:25.554 --> 00:11:32.087
against this horrible undead menace controlled by
Lady Briarwood herself. After this rebellion was

00:11:32.087 --> 00:11:37.558
incited, fires were burning, individuals were
killed that were responsible for keeping the

00:11:37.558 --> 00:11:42.316
people down and just generally bad people all
around were being slaughtered by our intrepid

00:11:42.316 --> 00:11:49.376
adventurers. They made their way into Whitestone
Castle, where they had uncovered some information

00:11:49.376 --> 00:11:53.458
about the ziggurat, a project in which the
Briarwoods had been developing something beneath

00:11:53.458 --> 00:11:58.015
the city of Whitestone, and discovered that
Percy's sister Cassandra, who was thought to be

00:11:58.015 --> 00:12:02.811
dead long ago, actually still survived and was
being kept in the castle. She joined the party as

00:12:02.811 --> 00:12:08.978
you guys fought your way down underneath the city
of Whitestone through a series of tunnels, finding

00:12:08.978 --> 00:12:16.112
yourselves unintentionally locked within a trap, a
retooled version of what was previously an acid

00:12:16.112 --> 00:12:20.106
distillery for the whitestone that's actually
mined from the surrounding mountains, and thought

00:12:20.106 --> 00:12:25.376
left for dead by the Briarwoods themselves. In
which Vax was charmed and taken along with them,

00:12:25.376 --> 00:12:26.998
and Cassandra showed herself--

00:12:26.998 --> 00:12:30.165
LAURA: You were the one who got us into the acid
in the first place. Thank you for that.

00:12:30.165 --> 00:12:31.858
LIAM: You don't think they would have done that?

00:12:31.858 --> 00:12:33.469
LAURA: I don't know.

00:12:33.541 --> 00:12:34.535
TRAVIS: We'll never know.

00:12:34.535 --> 00:12:35.908
LAURA: We'll never know.

00:12:35.908 --> 00:12:41.876
MARISHA: Acid sucks. I never want to encounter
acid again. Every time we do, it's bad. It's

00:12:41.876 --> 00:12:43.788
always bad.

00:12:43.788 --> 00:12:48.737
MATT: Well, acid's bad in general, you know, it's
not like, "Oh, this acid's fine."

00:12:48.797 --> 00:12:50.422
LIAM: Citric acid is pretty good.

00:12:50.479 --> 00:12:52.261
LAURA: Pretty delicious.

00:12:52.261 --> 00:12:53.520
MARISHA: Preserves apples.

00:12:53.520 --> 00:12:54.709
MATT: I stand corrected.

00:12:54.709 --> 00:12:57.605
LIAM: Could it be a citric acid trap?

00:12:57.605 --> 00:12:59.632
MATT: No. It's probably not going to happen.

00:12:59.632 --> 00:13:04.004
TRAVIS: Damn it, we should have done that 
check last time.

00:13:04.058 --> 00:13:07.281
"Can we check for citric acid?" 
"You can certainly try."

00:13:07.281 --> 00:13:09.422
(laughter)

00:13:09.422 --> 00:13:12.259
MATT: It's not acid resistance on your armor, it's
citric acid resistance.

00:13:12.259 --> 00:13:15.475
SAM: You don't get scurvy?

00:13:15.475 --> 00:13:24.628
MATT: Very possible. Anyway, back to the story.
Upon facing the danger of this trap, and seeing

00:13:24.628 --> 00:13:30.387
Cassandra turn redcoat to them with the
Briarwoods, the party managed to think their way

00:13:30.387 --> 00:13:34.379
out of the trap before too much damage was taken,
and following the Briarwoods to the final chamber

00:13:34.379 --> 00:13:39.717
where the ziggurat was constructed, where apparently
there is some sort of ritual underway to some

00:13:39.717 --> 00:13:44.368
entity they worship or work with that they refer
to as "The Whispered One." Upon following, the

00:13:44.368 --> 00:13:48.596
party dividing up and following up the sides of
the ziggurat, they managed to catch an encounter

00:13:48.660 --> 00:13:53.868
with the Briarwoods, a charmed Vax, and Cassandra
before they could enter the actual ritual

00:13:53.868 --> 00:13:54.967
chamber.

00:13:54.967 --> 00:14:01.487
A battle commenced where, thanks to proper
preparation, did not go all so poorly, and in the

00:14:01.487 --> 00:14:08.207
process Sylas Briarwood was destroyed through a
combination of Sunbeam via Keyleth and some Pike

00:14:08.207 --> 00:14:16.148
shield deflection-- a very "Avengers" moment with
a hint of phallic imagery. Sylas's destruction

00:14:16.148 --> 00:14:22.417
sent Delilah into a mournful wail and she decided
to try and complete the ritual herself, although

00:14:22.417 --> 00:14:27.531
it may or may not have been too soon to do so.
Dimension Doored her way into the ritual room,

00:14:27.531 --> 00:14:32.799
which you guys followed over the wall. She seemed
to complete the ritual, creating this small

00:14:32.799 --> 00:14:41.127
vacuous spinning black sphere that is locked in
place. Vex was nearly felled by a spell as she

00:14:41.127 --> 00:14:49.223
attempted to fly in and stop it. The party then
rushed in to aid Vex. Percy took a shot that

00:14:49.223 --> 00:14:55.895
intentionally did not finish Lady Briarwood, just
taking off her right arm as she fell unconscious,

00:14:55.895 --> 00:14:57.211
bleeding out.

00:14:57.211 --> 00:15:01.791
Vex, unconscious from the fall and also on the
cusp of dying, the party rushed in to help her and

00:15:01.791 --> 00:15:09.656
realized seemingly the vicinity around this orb
had cut all magic. So thus, they were snatched up

00:15:09.656 --> 00:15:16.429
and escorted off the side of the ziggurat, and
that was where we left the last game. To pick up

00:15:16.429 --> 00:15:20.860
where we were, who had Vex in their arms last
time? Was that you?

00:15:20.860 --> 00:15:21.811
LIAM: Grog.

00:15:21.811 --> 00:15:28.093
MATT: Grog, you have Vex in your arms. Who has
Delilah? And who has Cassandra?

00:15:28.140 --> 00:15:29.569
LIAM: Grog has both.

00:15:29.569 --> 00:15:32.443
LAURA: He has both of us. I'm piled on top of
Delilah.

00:15:32.443 --> 00:15:39.717
MATT: Okay. So, you have Delilah and and Vex. Who
has Cassandra?

00:15:39.717 --> 00:15:41.325
TALIESIN: I think I have Cassandra.

00:15:41.325 --> 00:15:49.879
MATT: Okay. So, as you guys are rushing down the
steps of the ziggurat itself, the green glass-like

00:15:49.914 --> 00:15:55.588
jade material slowly fading into the whitestone as
you rush towards the base with what little bit of

00:15:55.689 --> 00:15:59.248
light was available to you from the small bits of
torches placed at the bottom of the ziggurat and

00:15:59.248 --> 00:16:03.104
what light sources you brought with you. You find
yourselves at the very bottom of the dirt, looking

00:16:03.104 --> 00:16:09.602
around. There's the exit where you guys originally
entered this chamber. You do also see a number of

00:16:09.602 --> 00:16:17.557
small metallic carts, some turned on their sides;
you can see crumpled bits of whitestone and

00:16:17.557 --> 00:16:24.396
shards of that green glass residuum material left
out. You can see there's piles of leftover

00:16:24.435 --> 00:16:28.310
building materials that are scattered about the
floor of this area.

00:16:28.310 --> 00:16:33.462
LIAM: Are you saying that Keyleth and I are caught
up, at this point? Because I know that people

00:16:33.462 --> 00:16:39.260
started going out of the temple, Keyleth ran in, I
handed Vex to Grog, I ran after.

00:16:39.260 --> 00:16:41.792
MATT: So you guys are still a little bit behind
the rest of the group. You're on your way now,

00:16:41.792 --> 00:16:44.545
you're just now rushing down the stairs of the
ziggurat while the rest of you have reached the

00:16:44.545 --> 00:16:45.879
bottom.

00:16:45.879 --> 00:16:49.335
TRAVIS: She rolled that natural 20 that kept her
from probably getting sucked into Uranus.

00:16:49.335 --> 00:16:53.211
MARISHA: Yep. Probably.

00:16:53.211 --> 00:16:54.973
MATT: Save versus Uranus.

00:16:54.973 --> 00:17:00.799
MARISHA: That would have been bad. Save versus
Uranus? Is that what you said?

00:17:00.799 --> 00:17:01.908
MATT: That is what I said.

00:17:01.908 --> 00:17:03.160
LIAM: Put it in the handbook.

00:17:03.160 --> 00:17:04.748
TALIESIN: It's like we're 12.

00:17:04.748 --> 00:17:08.050
MATT: The next errata document.

00:17:08.050 --> 00:17:09.841
TRAVIS: And Lady Briarwood is manacled.

00:17:09.841 --> 00:17:14.737
MATT: She's manacled behind you. And Cassandra is
tied up. As the rest of you rush down to the

00:17:14.737 --> 00:17:20.193
bottom, minus Vax and Keyleth, do you wish to wait
for them, or push on to the tunnel where you

00:17:20.193 --> 00:17:20.961
entered?

00:17:20.961 --> 00:17:24.036
TRAVIS: Fuck them. We keep running. We're trying
to get out of the area, right?

00:17:24.036 --> 00:17:26.071
LAURA: I'm barely conscious right now, right?

00:17:26.071 --> 00:17:30.350
MARISHA: I was yelling in the earpiece, fuck it,
run!

00:17:30.350 --> 00:17:32.271
MATT: So you know that they're following you.

00:17:32.271 --> 00:17:33.354
LAURA: Grog.

00:17:33.354 --> 00:17:34.646
TRAVIS: Yes?

00:17:34.646 --> 00:17:38.766
LAURA: Get this bitch off of me.

00:17:38.766 --> 00:17:43.532
TRAVIS: Oh, sorry. Yeah, fuck it. It's like
carrying coats. Hold on. So I put one in each

00:17:43.532 --> 00:17:44.630
arm. There you go.

00:17:44.630 --> 00:17:45.613
LAURA: Are we leaving?

00:17:45.613 --> 00:17:48.352
TRAVIS: Yeah, we're trying to get out of here as
fast as we can. How are you feeling?

00:17:48.352 --> 00:17:53.121
LAURA: Grog. And I reach up and grab onto his
beard. This is a beautiful beard.

00:17:53.121 --> 00:17:55.322
Watch out for traps.

00:17:55.322 --> 00:17:58.359
MATT: So at this point, as you're having this
discussion, you guys are rushing down, and you

00:17:58.359 --> 00:18:02.968
guys see this as you're rushing down the ziggurat,
the radiant energy that is currently the form of

00:18:02.968 --> 00:18:08.969
Pike seems to have slowly dwindled and she looks
over her shoulder with a look of immediate fear as

00:18:08.969 --> 00:18:11.292
it blinks out.

00:18:11.292 --> 00:18:13.795
MARISHA: What? Why the-- why?

00:18:13.795 --> 00:18:18.372
SAM: Because of technology, and also the
story.

00:18:18.372 --> 00:18:22.005
TRAVIS: (laughs) I didn't even know she was gone!

00:18:22.062 --> 00:18:23.397
MARISHA: I didn't, either!

00:18:23.397 --> 00:18:25.391
SAM: Pike, no! No, Pike!

00:18:25.391 --> 00:18:32.674
MATT: It seems as if whatever anti-magical aura
has slowly pushed the divine connection that keeps

00:18:32.674 --> 00:18:35.929
her present from the current vicinity.

00:18:35.929 --> 00:18:37.626
MARISHA: Did your computer die?

00:18:37.626 --> 00:18:40.184
SAM: Also, the battery died on the computer.

00:18:40.184 --> 00:18:43.031
LIAM: It's that black orb!

00:18:43.031 --> 00:18:47.400
LAURA: I didn't know. Where can we plug it in at?

00:18:47.400 --> 00:18:54.604
MATT: So, you guys push on, making your way to the
cavern and heading back towards the undercroft

00:18:54.604 --> 00:18:56.600
vicinity of Whitestone.

00:18:56.644 --> 00:19:01.613
TRAVIS: Yeah. Let me know when we leave that
big-ass room that the ziggurat is in. We're still

00:19:01.613 --> 00:19:02.558
in it, right?

00:19:02.558 --> 00:19:06.292
MATT: You guys have just now made your way towards
the exit tunnel, so you're just now leaving.

00:19:06.292 --> 00:19:09.850
TRAVIS: I remember the tunnels sucking
booby-trap-wise.

00:19:09.850 --> 00:19:16.022
TALIESIN: Not until we're past the gold room. The
glass room.

00:19:16.022 --> 00:19:17.368
LIAM: I marked all the traps.

00:19:17.368 --> 00:19:18.809
TALIESIN: All the traps are marked.

00:19:18.809 --> 00:19:20.967
SAM: All the traps that we found.

00:19:20.967 --> 00:19:24.907
LAURA: No, remember? There was one, the poison
dust one which we're immune to still.

00:19:24.907 --> 00:19:26.628
TALIESIN: But that already got set off.

00:19:26.628 --> 00:19:30.863
TRAVIS: Can I check for traps as I go?

00:19:30.863 --> 00:19:33.587
MATT: Sure. Well, you push and make your way
into--

00:19:33.587 --> 00:19:35.119
SAM: You're checking for traps?

00:19:35.119 --> 00:19:36.070
TRAVIS: Yeah.

00:19:36.070 --> 00:19:37.567
SAM: You're holding two ladies.

00:19:37.567 --> 00:19:39.943
MATT: As you guys rush behind.

00:19:39.943 --> 00:19:41.726
TRAVIS: Normal Saturday night, my friend.

00:19:41.771 --> 00:19:42.762
SAM: Oh boy.

00:19:42.762 --> 00:19:47.037
MATT: You head back into the tunnel having to
lower your head a little bit as you're carrying

00:19:47.037 --> 00:19:50.697
this payload, you're lumbering through, giant
goliath body just stomping through--

00:19:50.697 --> 00:19:54.009
MARISHA: A payload? He called you a payload.

00:19:54.009 --> 00:20:01.283
MATT: Yeah. You come to where there is the
partially-dissolved stone door, and you rush

00:20:01.283 --> 00:20:04.318
underneath and using all of your back muscle--
make a strength check.

00:20:04.318 --> 00:20:11.402
TRAVIS: Okay. That's good. 24.

00:20:11.402 --> 00:20:15.371
MATT: (grunts) Tensing the entirety of your muscle
structure--

00:20:15.371 --> 00:20:16.585
LAURA: I'm not that heavy.

00:20:16.585 --> 00:20:20.018
MATT: Oh, it's not about you being heavy. It's
about the door itself not being quite large enough

00:20:20.018 --> 00:20:25.335
for him to come through carrying that large of
people. You (grunts) lift it, and you hear the

00:20:25.335 --> 00:20:31.598
stone (scraping noise) shift as it's forcefully
pushed up. You hear snaps of things breaking or

00:20:31.598 --> 00:20:36.473
supports that were keeping it in place as you,
essentially, break the door and jam it upward,

00:20:36.473 --> 00:20:38.612
giving you enough space to pull through the rest
of the party.

00:20:38.612 --> 00:20:41.782
TRAVIS: I fucking hate doors. Don't we all?

00:20:41.782 --> 00:20:42.898
SAM: We do.

00:20:42.898 --> 00:20:45.110
MATT: Indeed. Greatest nemesis of Vox Machina.

00:20:45.110 --> 00:20:47.118
TALIESIN: Is Cassandra awake or is she
unconscious?

00:20:47.118 --> 00:20:48.084
MATT: She's unconscious now.

00:20:48.084 --> 00:20:49.054
TALIESIN: Damn it.

00:20:49.054 --> 00:20:57.377
MATT: You make your way into the top level of the
distillery room, down the pathway into the upward

00:20:57.377 --> 00:21:01.242
ramp to the opposite side, the door open, and you
are now outside of the distillery trap.

00:21:01.242 --> 00:21:04.316
TRAVIS: It's the danger area.

00:21:04.316 --> 00:21:05.825
LAURA: Oh no.

00:21:05.825 --> 00:21:06.978
TRAVIS: You're out.

00:21:06.978 --> 00:21:09.399
SAM: Wait, so who's at zero health?

00:21:09.399 --> 00:21:10.572
TRAVIS: One point.

00:21:10.572 --> 00:21:11.929
LAURA: I'm at one point of health.

00:21:11.929 --> 00:21:13.447
SAM: We have potions, now. We're out of the
magic--

00:21:13.447 --> 00:21:14.759
TRAVIS: Can't you heal some people?

00:21:14.759 --> 00:21:15.824
TALIESIN: We can try a--

00:21:15.824 --> 00:21:17.544
TRAVIS: I have potions, too, but--

00:21:17.544 --> 00:21:18.944
MARISHA: Are we out of the room?

00:21:18.944 --> 00:21:20.085
LAURA: We're out of the room.

00:21:20.085 --> 00:21:21.146
TRAVIS: Yeah, we're out of the room.

00:21:21.146 --> 00:21:24.246
MATT: You're not currently with them, though.
You're behind with Vax, trying to catch up.

00:21:24.246 --> 00:21:29.252
TRAVIS: I have a common. Can I try giving Vex a
common healing potion?

00:21:29.252 --> 00:21:32.269
MATT: Yeah. You want to stop for a second and pull
it out?

00:21:32.269 --> 00:21:35.733
TRAVIS: I fucking drop Lady Briarwood on her face,
hard.

00:21:35.733 --> 00:21:36.861
SAM: Oh no, she might die.

00:21:36.861 --> 00:21:38.085
LAURA: Oh no, she could &lt;i&gt;die&lt;/i&gt;, die.

00:21:38.085 --> 00:21:43.297
MATT: Okay. She (thudding noise) rolls, bounces a
little bit from the sheer force of the throw.

00:21:43.297 --> 00:21:47.481
You're not even paying attention as to whether or
not she's still breathing. You reach in your pouch

00:21:47.481 --> 00:21:50.007
and bring out your potion. Set Vex down and hand
it to her.

00:21:50.007 --> 00:21:51.448
TRAVIS: Please work.

00:21:51.448 --> 00:21:55.918
MATT: You go ahead and heal 2d4 plus two hit
points.

00:21:55.918 --> 00:21:57.677
LAURA: Oh! Really?!

00:21:57.677 --> 00:21:58.786
MATT: Yeah.

00:21:58.786 --> 00:22:07.253
LAURA: Okay. Where's my d4? Plus two. Oh, that's
good. That's a whole eight points.

00:22:07.253 --> 00:22:10.007
MATT: There you go. That's actually a pretty good
roll.

00:22:10.007 --> 00:22:11.102
TRAVIS: And it stays? It works?

00:22:11.102 --> 00:22:15.579
MATT: At this point, as you guys have pushed
outside of that room, it appears to be functioning

00:22:15.579 --> 00:22:16.408
again.

00:22:16.408 --> 00:22:17.438
LAURA: Yay!

00:22:17.438 --> 00:22:25.882
TRAVIS: Oh, good. That took. Can you heal people?
It's a yes or no question.

00:22:25.882 --> 00:22:27.068
LAURA: I'm awake enough.

00:22:27.068 --> 00:22:28.179
TALIESIN: I can try.

00:22:28.179 --> 00:22:31.692
LAURA: I'm awake enough. I wake up and I cast
Cure Wounds on myself.

00:22:31.692 --> 00:22:33.942
MATT: Okay. Go for it. Roll for that.

00:22:33.942 --> 00:22:35.049
TALIESIN: I can't do that.

00:22:35.049 --> 00:22:38.176
LAURA: I'm like, "Ooh, I love me so much. Cure
me."

00:22:38.176 --> 00:22:40.589
MATT: At 1st level?

00:22:40.589 --> 00:22:47.467
LAURA: I think 2nd level. I have enough.

00:22:47.467 --> 00:22:54.371
MATT: So 2d8 plus your spellcasting modifier.
Whatever your wisdom modifier is.

00:22:54.371 --> 00:23:04.766
LAURA: That was not even as good as the common
potion. Oh. Well, sort of. 14.

00:23:04.766 --> 00:23:06.354
MATT: Okay.

00:23:06.354 --> 00:23:08.350
TRAVIS: Still pretty low.

00:23:08.350 --> 00:23:10.125
LAURA: So, basically full hit points at this
point.

00:23:10.125 --> 00:23:15.321
TRAVIS: I feel like we should heal you up just a
touch more. What are you at?

00:23:15.321 --> 00:23:16.495
LAURA: 23 points.

00:23:16.495 --> 00:23:18.076
TRAVIS: That's pretty fucking low.

00:23:18.076 --> 00:23:20.349
SAM: All right. I'll give you my greater heal.

00:23:20.349 --> 00:23:21.947
TRAVIS: I have one. She can have mine.

00:23:21.947 --> 00:23:23.015
LAURA: Really?

00:23:23.015 --> 00:23:23.970
TRAVIS: Yeah, I'm a giant.

00:23:23.970 --> 00:23:30.372
SAM: No, I'll take this one. I want you to have my
greater healing potion. It would mean so much to

00:23:30.372 --> 00:23:34.395
me if you would take it, drink.

00:23:34.395 --> 00:23:35.542
LAURA: Thanks, Scanlan.

00:23:35.542 --> 00:23:39.445
SAM: No problem. If Pike were here, I'd give it to
her, but...

00:23:39.445 --> 00:23:40.934
LAURA: Understandable.

00:23:40.934 --> 00:23:44.085
SAM: She's not, so. You're pretty cool, too.

00:23:44.085 --> 00:23:48.082
LAURA: Okay. Thanks, buddy. What do I roll for
that?

00:23:48.082 --> 00:23:49.606
SAM: 4d4 plus four.

00:23:49.606 --> 00:23:53.304
LAURA: Whoa. I feel so strong now.

00:23:53.304 --> 00:23:56.046
TRAVIS: You'd better roll strong.

00:23:56.046 --> 00:24:03.569
LAURA: 11. So I'm at 34 points.

00:24:03.569 --> 00:24:06.416
SAM: Hey, as a thank you for that.

00:24:06.416 --> 00:24:07.656
LAURA: What?

00:24:07.656 --> 00:24:09.229
SAM: What about that gun?

00:24:09.229 --> 00:24:10.379
LAURA: Scanlan!

00:24:10.379 --> 00:24:11.537
SAM: Just let me hold it!

00:24:11.537 --> 00:24:13.646
TRAVIS: Oh, he did just give you a potion.

00:24:13.646 --> 00:24:17.614
LAURA: I'm just letting you know, you're not
skilled with ranged attacks.

00:24:17.614 --> 00:24:19.657
TALIESIN: There's nothing he can do with it,
anyway. I have all the ammunition.

00:24:19.657 --> 00:24:20.666
LAURA: I know.

00:24:20.666 --> 00:24:25.269
SAM: That's what you think. My pickpocket fingers
are faster than you could ever imagine.

00:24:25.269 --> 00:24:28.807
TALIESIN: I really don't think they are.

00:24:28.807 --> 00:24:32.942
TRAVIS: Sounds like a challenge!

00:24:32.942 --> 00:24:36.590
MATT: At this point, Keyleth and Vax catch up to
the rest of you guys.

00:24:36.590 --> 00:24:39.624
SAM: I'll take that.

00:24:39.624 --> 00:24:43.517
TRAVIS: How did it go? Did you kill the little
black thing of death?

00:24:43.517 --> 00:24:47.204
MARISHA: (slowly) No, I didn't.

00:24:47.204 --> 00:24:54.403
TRAVIS: Vex gave Scanlan a gun. I don't think it's
loaded.

00:24:54.403 --> 00:24:57.293
MARISHA: Oh, god. Be careful.

00:24:57.326 --> 00:24:58.649
SAM: Does it look cool?

00:24:58.649 --> 00:24:59.724
TALIESIN: No.

00:24:59.724 --> 00:25:01.642
LAURA: We need to take care of that orb.

00:25:01.642 --> 00:25:10.933
MARISHA: No, I tried to jam a piece of the magic
glass. The jammy magic glass into it and-- I'm

00:25:10.933 --> 00:25:20.418
probably lucky that I was able to pull away as
quickly as I did, because I think it eats

00:25:20.418 --> 00:25:22.263
everything around it.

00:25:22.263 --> 00:25:23.839
LAURA: So wait, it's still there?

00:25:23.839 --> 00:25:26.069
MARISHA: Still there, yeah.

00:25:26.069 --> 00:25:27.607
TRAVIS: Is it moving at all?

00:25:27.607 --> 00:25:29.937
MARISHA: It's doing its really fast spinny thing.

00:25:29.937 --> 00:25:34.337
TRAVIS: What about all the bodies in the room? Are
they still like, (moans)?

00:25:34.337 --> 00:25:37.932
MARISHA: I thought I could maybe go into my
wildshape and bring down the building, I

00:25:37.958 --> 00:25:43.527
thought maybe if I collapsed the building, maybe
it was drawing some sort of energy from the net of

00:25:43.527 --> 00:25:49.959
intertwined bodies, but I couldn't, because it was
blocking all magic capabilities.

00:25:49.959 --> 00:25:54.301
LAURA: Can I look over at Lady Briarwood and do a
check on her to see if she looks stable?

00:25:54.301 --> 00:25:59.501
MATT: Sure. Which, at this point, just a note, in
all the chaos and all the intent, trying to get

00:25:59.501 --> 00:26:04.610
things out of there, you're just now starting to
realize that the Seeming spell that you placed on

00:26:04.610 --> 00:26:10.156
the whole party has also been canceled as part of
whatever this trigger anti-field was. So you all

00:26:10.156 --> 00:26:13.898
look around and realize, oh, we aren't a bunch of
Percys and Cassandras.

00:26:13.898 --> 00:26:15.195
TRAVIS: I'm beautiful again!

00:26:15.195 --> 00:26:16.298
TALIESIN: Thank you?

00:26:16.298 --> 00:26:18.673
LAURA: That's good, because I noticed your beard.

00:26:18.673 --> 00:26:19.652
TRAVIS: That's right.

00:26:19.652 --> 00:26:20.703
LAURA: That's right.

00:26:20.703 --> 00:26:22.693
TALIESIN: Are you checking on Lady Briarwood?

00:26:22.693 --> 00:26:23.540
LAURA: I am.

00:26:23.540 --> 00:26:24.874
MATT: Trinket's nuzzling the body.

00:26:24.874 --> 00:26:26.076
TALIESIN: Keep her unconscious.

00:26:26.076 --> 00:26:27.144
LAURA: Trinket, careful.

00:26:27.144 --> 00:26:29.215
TALIESIN: I'm going to try and wake Cassandra up.

00:26:29.215 --> 00:26:30.548
MATT: Okay.

00:26:30.548 --> 00:26:32.348
(Skype sounds)

00:26:32.348 --> 00:26:33.802
SAM: It's the magic.

00:26:33.802 --> 00:26:35.023
LAURA: That's magic.

00:26:35.023 --> 00:26:43.142
MATT: All right, so. You go ahead and check on
her. Go ahead and make--actually this is pretty

00:26:43.142 --> 00:26:46.894
easy, you just go ahead and take a moment, you
just feel her for a pulse. She is currently still

00:26:46.894 --> 00:26:56.318
alive. And with a flash of divine energy just past
the outskirts of this anti-magic field, you can

00:26:56.318 --> 00:27:01.941
see Pike's radiant ethereal form all of a sudden
reconstruct itself.

00:27:01.941 --> 00:27:03.778
LAURA and MARISHA: Pike!

00:27:03.778 --> 00:27:05.578
ASHLEY: I'm back!

00:27:05.578 --> 00:27:07.351
SAM: Oh, thank god.

00:27:07.398 --> 00:27:09.810
ASHLEY: We were killing Lady Briarwood?

00:27:09.810 --> 00:27:13.684
SAM: No, we're okay. Everything's okay. Thank
Sarenrae you're back.

00:27:13.684 --> 00:27:17.682
ASHLEY: Okay. Can I heal somebody?

00:27:17.682 --> 00:27:20.948
SAM: We did that a bit while you were gone, but
yes.

00:27:20.948 --> 00:27:25.819
LAURA: But I'm still pretty low! If you feel like
it, I would take it and I would be grateful.

00:27:25.819 --> 00:27:27.278
ASHLEY: How's everybody else?

00:27:27.278 --> 00:27:28.750
TRAVIS: Can you heal a couple of people?

00:27:28.750 --> 00:27:29.740
ASHLEY: Yeah!

00:27:29.740 --> 00:27:32.240
MARISHA: I'm a little shaky.

00:27:32.240 --> 00:27:33.487
TALIESIN: I'm a little shaky, as well.

00:27:33.487 --> 00:27:34.859
LAURA: Pike, heal us all. We love you.

00:27:34.859 --> 00:27:38.556
ASHLEY: Okay. Let me do a Mass Cure Wounds. I have
that.

00:27:38.556 --> 00:27:40.651
LIAM: Gather together, everyone, gather together.

00:27:40.651 --> 00:27:41.883
MARISHA: Group hug!

00:27:41.883 --> 00:27:45.973
LAURA: Oh wait, but wait! Don't let Lady Briarwood
in the circle of healing.

00:27:45.973 --> 00:27:47.347
SAM: Wait, is she alive? Did you check her?

00:27:47.347 --> 00:27:54.645
MATT: She is currently alive. She's unconscious.
And she's, thankfully from the blast and the sheer

00:27:54.645 --> 00:28:02.243
force of it, part of the wound was cauterized, but
she has been bleeding quite a bit on the run down

00:28:02.243 --> 00:28:04.260
here, and she would probably need some sort of--

00:28:04.260 --> 00:28:05.327
MARISHA: Should I stabilize her?

00:28:05.327 --> 00:28:07.251
TRAVIS: Yeah, wait, stabilize her first.

00:28:07.251 --> 00:28:11.188
LAURA: We're away from the fucking sacrifice area.
Maybe we should just kill her.

00:28:11.188 --> 00:28:16.110
TALIESIN: I want to quickly check my gun. Is Lord
Briarwood's name still on it?

00:28:16.110 --> 00:28:23.502
MATT: You go and inspect the barrel. No. Sylas
Briarwood is currently erased from the barrel.

00:28:23.502 --> 00:28:27.437
TALIESIN: Let's hold off just a bit before we kill
her.

00:28:27.437 --> 00:28:32.240
TRAVIS: I have some really dirty rags. Could I do
a medicine check and try and stabilize her

00:28:32.240 --> 00:28:33.220
bleeding?

00:28:33.220 --> 00:28:34.342
MATT: If you want to.

00:28:34.342 --> 00:28:35.465
SAM: Dirty rags?

00:28:35.465 --> 00:28:36.560
TRAVIS: 18!

00:28:36.560 --> 00:28:39.581
SAM: Do you have medicine skills?

00:28:39.581 --> 00:28:40.478
TRAVIS: Zero!

00:28:40.478 --> 00:28:44.526
MATT: So yeah, as you guys are having this
conversation, Grog comes over and pulls out a

00:28:44.526 --> 00:28:51.573
mottled mass of really filthy rags from the Bag of
Holding, probably used in various nose-wiping

00:28:51.573 --> 00:28:52.516
circumstances.

00:28:52.516 --> 00:28:53.698
TRAVIS: Or other things.

00:28:53.698 --> 00:29:03.004
MATT: But somehow it manages to stop the bleeding
and keep her relatively stable

00:29:03.004 --> 00:29:04.342
for the moment, yeah.

00:29:04.342 --> 00:29:11.267
TRAVIS: Okay, and then I take her by the foot and
I drag her on her face away from the group. Very

00:29:11.267 --> 00:29:12.992
gently, but still by her foot.

00:29:12.992 --> 00:29:13.794
MATT: Okay.

00:29:13.794 --> 00:29:15.609
TALIESIN: Double-check. Perhaps gag her, as well.

00:29:15.609 --> 00:29:18.508
TRAVIS: Oh right, yeah, she talks that shit,
doesn't she?

00:29:18.508 --> 00:29:22.720
TALIESIN: We don't want her speaking, and she only
has one arm, so magic's going to be tricky.

00:29:22.720 --> 00:29:25.085
LIAM: She can't do this kind of thing, but she can
still talk.

00:29:25.085 --> 00:29:27.572
MATT: Pike, did you say you wanted to cast Mass
Cure Wounds, you said?

00:29:27.572 --> 00:29:28.712
ASHLEY: Yes.

00:29:28.712 --> 00:29:31.806
MATT: Okay, you can choose up to six creatures in
a 30-foot radius, so it's your choice who you want

00:29:31.806 --> 00:29:32.787
to heal.

00:29:32.787 --> 00:29:36.110
TALIESIN: She can't see us. Why are we holding our
hands up?

00:29:36.110 --> 00:29:37.205
LAURA: I don't know.

00:29:37.205 --> 00:29:38.908
TALIESIN: Actually, you can see us on the screen.
Never mind.

00:29:38.908 --> 00:29:41.840
ASHLEY: I know, I have you guys on my iPad down
here, but you're delayed.

00:29:41.840 --> 00:29:43.654
LIAM: There's six including all of us.

00:29:43.654 --> 00:29:48.199
ASHLEY: Okay, so I'll cure all the six people in
my family.

00:29:48.199 --> 00:29:52.424
MATT: All right, so that's 3d8 plus five for you.

00:29:52.424 --> 00:29:53.617
LAURA: Wow!

00:29:53.617 --> 00:29:55.078
LIAM: Pour one out for your homies.

00:29:55.078 --> 00:29:56.734
MARISHA: Roll high!

00:29:56.734 --> 00:29:59.179
MATT: Oh, to have a cleric in the group again.

00:29:59.179 --> 00:30:01.656
TRAVIS: I know, right? Shit! Life!

00:30:01.656 --> 00:30:04.983
LAURA and MARISHA: She's rolling.

00:30:04.983 --> 00:30:10.058
ASHLEY: 26!

00:30:10.058 --> 00:30:12.168
ALL: Ooh!

00:30:12.168 --> 00:30:15.439
(laughter)

00:30:15.439 --> 00:30:20.162
MATT: Oh. Let this be a lesson to all the people
out there who think clerics are lame and nobody

00:30:20.162 --> 00:30:21.464
loves them.

00:30:21.464 --> 00:30:29.029
TRAVIS: We love them! Can I tear a piece of fabric
off of one of the three remaining fancy robes and

00:30:29.029 --> 00:30:35.838
I tie it around Lady Briarwood's mouth? But like--
(muffled) in, and you know like (muffled) in the

00:30:35.838 --> 00:30:37.962
teeth all-- she can't really enunciate.

00:30:37.962 --> 00:30:41.699
MATT: Okay, so you pull it and you gag her around
the side of her mouth and as you end up

00:30:41.699 --> 00:30:45.595
tying it, you see one of her eyes lulls open and
she kind of, (coughs, sputters).

00:30:45.633 --> 00:30:47.308
TRAVIS: (yelps) Shit, she's awake!

00:30:47.308 --> 00:30:49.668
SAM and LAURA: Punch her in the face!

00:30:49.668 --> 00:30:51.639
SAM: No wait, don't. You'll kill her.

00:30:51.639 --> 00:30:53.795
MATT: Up to you. What do you want to do?

00:30:53.795 --> 00:30:54.822
SAM: Blindfold her!

00:30:54.822 --> 00:30:55.912
TRAVIS: I slap her.

00:30:55.912 --> 00:30:58.649
MATT: (laughing) Roll a strength check.

00:30:58.649 --> 00:30:59.617
SAM: Shit!

00:30:59.617 --> 00:31:01.152
(laughter)

00:31:01.152 --> 00:31:03.321
SAM: He's going to kill her with a slap.

00:31:03.321 --> 00:31:06.452
LAURA: She'll be knocked unconscious and she'll
have to save three times again.

00:31:06.452 --> 00:31:07.636
TRAVIS: 21.

00:31:07.636 --> 00:31:08.633
SAM: Oh that's good!

00:31:08.633 --> 00:31:14.027
MATT: (whack) Right across her face. You hear a
resounding crack sound as it appears some part of

00:31:14.027 --> 00:31:17.521
her cheek bone probably is going to be fairly
bruised tomorrow. But she is straight to

00:31:17.579 --> 00:31:18.712
unconsciousness again.

00:31:18.712 --> 00:31:20.237
(cheering)

00:31:20.237 --> 00:31:22.238
TRAVIS: If you're curious, she's still alive.

00:31:22.238 --> 00:31:23.268
TALIESIN: I can tell.

00:31:23.268 --> 00:31:24.613
LAURA: She almost killed me.

00:31:24.613 --> 00:31:26.455
MARISHA: Is she just unconscious?

00:31:26.455 --> 00:31:28.228
MATT: She's still breathing.

00:31:28.228 --> 00:31:30.470
TALIESIN: I'm going to try and wake up Cassandra.

00:31:30.470 --> 00:31:31.728
MATT: Okay.

00:31:31.728 --> 00:31:33.470
TRAVIS: I did bandages on her real good.

00:31:33.504 --> 00:31:38.142
MATT: As you're standing in the tunnel, they're
off to one side. You go over to where Cassandra

00:31:38.142 --> 00:31:43.921
is. You briefly set her down to have this
conversation. She's still bound on her arms and

00:31:43.977 --> 00:31:48.987
legs-- she was nearly hogtied by Grog when you
guys finished up at the top of the temple. She's

00:31:48.987 --> 00:31:55.630
breathing. You can see, the dirt from being tossed
to the ground is caked in on where the tear marks

00:31:55.630 --> 00:32:01.338
are down her face. You shake her gently and eventually
she comes to consciousness and her eyes

00:32:01.382 --> 00:32:07.200
roll around for a moment, she glances over at you.
"Percy?"

00:32:07.200 --> 00:32:13.172
TALIESIN: We will have a discussion later. In the
meantime, do you know what that thing in there is

00:32:13.172 --> 00:32:14.781
and how do we stop it?

00:32:14.781 --> 00:32:19.625
MATT: "I don't... what? What's going on?"

00:32:19.625 --> 00:32:21.239
LAURA: The spinning orb of death.

00:32:21.239 --> 00:32:24.713
MATT: She starts moving around, looking around the
tunnel real fast at everyone. "What happened?

00:32:24.713 --> 00:32:26.298
"What's going on?"

00:32:26.298 --> 00:32:28.244
TRAVIS: You betrayed some bitches, that's what you
did.

00:32:28.244 --> 00:32:33.974
MATT: And as you say this, you see she reacts as
almost someone had just punched her in the chest

00:32:33.974 --> 00:32:40.117
and the tears begin to flow down her face again,
and she, "I'm sorry."

00:32:40.117 --> 00:32:42.421
TALIESIN: I'm going to slap her in the face.

00:32:42.421 --> 00:32:46.203
MATT: Okay. (slap) Go ahead and roll a strength
check.

00:32:46.203 --> 00:32:47.663
SAM: That's your sister, Percy!

00:32:47.663 --> 00:32:49.836
LAURA: She might be unconscious too!

00:32:49.878 --> 00:32:51.648
TALIESIN: Not with my strength!

00:32:51.648 --> 00:32:53.251
TRAVIS: (jokingly) Natural 20.

00:32:53.251 --> 00:32:55.149
(laughter)

00:32:55.149 --> 00:33:03.362
TALIESIN: 16. Well, actually my strength is still
thin because I still have a--

00:33:03.362 --> 00:33:05.867
SAM: Oh! Negative two strength, right.

00:33:05.867 --> 00:33:06.930
TALIESIN: So, 15.

00:33:06.930 --> 00:33:15.677
MATT: 15, yeah okay. You smack her to get her
attention in this circumstance. She stops for a

00:33:15.677 --> 00:33:20.192
second and gathers herself. Her breathing slows
and she stares off into space for a moment.

00:33:20.192 --> 00:33:27.803
TALIESIN: I need my sister back. Are you awake?
Are you a terrible person? Do I want to strangle

00:33:27.803 --> 00:33:29.004
you right now?

00:33:29.004 --> 00:33:30.115
MATT: "Probably."

00:33:30.115 --> 00:33:35.654
TALIESIN: Good. Then we can work with this. They
were building something down here. The Briarwoods

00:33:35.654 --> 00:33:41.088
are no longer a problem. They were building
something-- what do you know about it? It maybe

00:33:41.088 --> 00:33:46.218
started, it seems to be affecting magic. I think.

00:33:46.218 --> 00:33:50.982
MATT: "I don't know. They wouldn't let me near
it."

00:33:50.982 --> 00:33:53.162
LAURA: Don't lie to us anymore!

00:33:53.162 --> 00:33:58.219
MATT: "I'm not lying! Do I have a reason to lie
right now?" And she looks over at you with an

00:33:58.219 --> 00:34:10.583
intensity to her gaze that catches you not as
desperation, but as passionate self-loathing.

00:34:10.583 --> 00:34:16.352
LIAM: You seem to really believe your words, but
you know your word is worth fuck all right now.

00:34:16.352 --> 00:34:18.388
Fuck all.

00:34:18.388 --> 00:34:33.529
MATT: "I know. I know." She leans her head down on
the side of this cavern wall and stares off into

00:34:33.572 --> 00:34:47.017
space. "All that I know about this is that they've
been building it under the guidance of some other

00:34:47.017 --> 00:35:00.429
"person or entity. They referred to him many times
as the Whispered One. They're very secretive about

00:35:00.429 --> 00:35:06.915
"it. The only reason I knew was because I overheard
a few conversations and questioned them about it. To

00:35:06.955 --> 00:35:18.494
"which there was punishment. But they mainly kept
me to try and keep the people at bay. My job was

00:35:18.494 --> 00:35:27.752
"to keep in contact with anyone who would attempt
to rise against them, and inform them. I would

00:35:27.752 --> 00:35:33.153
"prevent any surprises, although apparently
(chuckles) and thankfully, I didn't do a very good job."

00:35:33.153 --> 00:35:36.568
And she looks around the room at the rest of
you.

00:35:36.568 --> 00:35:47.489
SAM: Can I check my history memory banks to see if
I know anything about the Whispered One or if that

00:35:47.489 --> 00:35:48.588
jogs any memory?

00:35:48.588 --> 00:35:50.032
MATT: Roll a religion check, Mr. Bard.

00:35:50.032 --> 00:35:54.414
SAM: Religion check? Well, that's not good. 20.

00:35:54.414 --> 00:35:56.022
LAURA: What?! Natural 20?

00:35:56.022 --> 00:35:56.820
SAM: No.

00:35:56.820 --> 00:35:59.709
LAURA: Damn it! I had a really strong reaction to
that.

00:35:59.709 --> 00:36:01.679
SAM: Oh.

00:36:01.679 --> 00:36:03.799
TRAVIS: Yes, the whispers!

00:36:03.799 --> 00:36:07.058
MARISHA: He's whispering about the Whispered One!

00:36:07.058 --> 00:36:08.280
SAM: He's gone! Where is he?

00:36:08.280 --> 00:36:09.560
TRAVIS: This is the pre-show days!

00:36:09.560 --> 00:36:11.189
LIAM: It's not new, it's just been a while.

00:36:11.189 --> 00:36:12.367
TRAVIS: It's been a long time.

00:36:12.367 --> 00:36:13.826
LAURA: Yeah, but he's on this side of the table.

00:36:13.826 --> 00:36:15.348
TALIESIN: None of us have rolled this well in so
long.

00:36:15.348 --> 00:36:17.182
TRAVIS: We used to play-- don't over-listen to
it!

00:36:17.182 --> 00:36:25.356
TALIESIN: (starts singing In the Hall of the
Mountain King)

00:36:25.356 --> 00:36:27.250
LIAM: He is licking the inside of Sam's ear.

00:36:27.250 --> 00:36:28.655
LAURA: Look at his eyes!

00:36:28.655 --> 00:36:36.649
LIAM: Matthew is the Whispered One.

00:36:36.649 --> 00:36:43.184
LAURA: He is the Whispered One! This is normally
the time when Sam would--

00:36:43.184 --> 00:36:45.746
SAM: It was all tongue in my ear the whole time!

00:36:45.746 --> 00:36:46.992
(laughter)

00:36:46.992 --> 00:36:48.591
SAM: It was so dirty.

00:36:48.591 --> 00:36:59.036
The Whispered One! I have a memory! I don't
know where I learned of this knowledge-- I am very

00:36:59.095 --> 00:37:09.589
old-- but I did, at some point in my travels, I
remember reading about something. A lich king?

00:37:09.589 --> 00:37:12.317
MATT: A lich entity, yeah.

00:37:12.317 --> 00:37:19.727
SAM: Who wanted to be a god. And his name was
Vecna, and they called him the Whispered One.

00:37:19.727 --> 00:37:25.717
That's all I remember, he tried to achieve great
power, and I don't know if he was successful or

00:37:25.717 --> 00:37:26.694
not.

00:37:26.694 --> 00:37:28.066
MARISHA: Oh boy.

00:37:28.066 --> 00:37:30.789
LAURA: Cassandra, does any of that sound
familiar?

00:37:30.789 --> 00:37:37.047
MATT: Cassandra shakes her head and says,
"Honestly, I didn't know anything beyond the name.

00:37:37.047 --> 00:37:41.506
"I just knew they were very close with this
individual."

00:37:41.506 --> 00:37:48.879
LAURA: When you betrayed us, you said you were
serving a higher purpose. Did they plan to

00:37:48.879 --> 00:37:50.674
sacrifice you to him?

00:37:50.674 --> 00:38:02.025
MATT: "I know there was a blood ritual involved. I
did not know more than that. There was to be a

00:38:02.076 --> 00:38:10.479
"gift of power should I give an element of my life
to this ritual." She shakes her head for a second.

00:38:10.479 --> 00:38:23.047
She blinks her eyes, and she says, "I don't feel
like I was right in my head. I look back on so

00:38:23.047 --> 00:38:34.488
"many decisions I've made, and all the people that
I've--" The tears just start flowing again.

00:38:34.488 --> 00:38:40.956
LIAM: Insight check. (rolls) I'll take that. 14.

00:38:40.956 --> 00:38:54.389
MATT: 14. Best that you can read off her is
there is a deep look of regret and sorrow in her

00:38:54.444 --> 00:39:00.310
face. And you do notice that, through most of this
conversation, as much as she's been able to talk

00:39:00.367 --> 00:39:04.657
to all of you, she has been unable to make eye
contact with Percy.

00:39:04.657 --> 00:39:15.755
LIAM: I'm going to walk over and plop down in
front of her and say, you've backed a losing

00:39:15.755 --> 00:39:24.457
team. And that's not surprising, you having been
through what you've been through. That's all gone

00:39:24.457 --> 00:39:36.284
now. Sylas is gone, Delilah is on death's door.
Whitestone needs to be tended to and protected. Do

00:39:36.284 --> 00:39:44.576
you know anything that can help us save your
birthright here and now?

00:39:44.576 --> 00:39:55.308
MATT: "I mean, you've already done half the job."
Her eyes look over at the unconscious Delilah in

00:39:55.308 --> 00:39:57.788
the hallway.

00:39:57.788 --> 00:40:05.550
MARISHA: Cassandra, is there any reason why they'd
want to sacrifice you in particular?

00:40:05.550 --> 00:40:20.976
MATT: She thinks hard for a second, her eyes
squinting. "I don't. They spoke very little--

00:40:20.976 --> 00:40:30.650
"intentionally, I think-- of what they wanted to
do. To be honest, I think there was an element

00:40:30.650 --> 00:40:39.203
"that even they didn't know quite what they were
doing. I was a tool. I was to be used. I had my

00:40:39.203 --> 00:40:47.554
"purposes. I did my best to fulfill them."

00:40:47.554 --> 00:40:54.289
TRAVIS: I've got a question. Do you care if I
smash the shit out of Lady Briarwood's head now?

00:40:54.289 --> 00:41:01.436
MATT: She glances over at her, and with a stern
look on her face she goes, "Someone needs to

00:41:01.436 --> 00:41:08.543
"avenge my family." And for the first time she
looks over and makes eye contact with you. You

00:41:08.543 --> 00:41:15.857
feel a pulse in your hand, like a heartbeat.
(thoom) The gun itself seems warmer and warmer,

00:41:15.857 --> 00:41:23.524
and you guys all notice as a bit of smoke begins
to billow out the sides of Percy's sleeves. You

00:41:23.603 --> 00:41:31.663
hear a familiar voice creep up in the back of your
head. "Percival."

00:41:31.663 --> 00:41:34.207
TALIESIN: I walk up to Lady Briarwood.

00:41:34.207 --> 00:41:36.810
MATT: "Here at your mercy."

00:41:36.810 --> 00:41:39.439
TALIESIN: I put my gun to Lady Briarwood's
head.

00:41:39.477 --> 00:41:41.614
SAM: Wait, Percy, you're going to shoot an unarmed
woman?

00:41:41.614 --> 00:41:42.720
TRAVIS: Hush!

00:41:42.720 --> 00:41:44.378
SAM: Don't shoot an unarmed woman.

00:41:44.378 --> 00:41:46.618
TRAVIS: Unarmed? She tried to kill us.

00:41:46.618 --> 00:41:52.796
TALIESIN: You changed the deal. Take her name off
the gun.

00:41:52.796 --> 00:41:58.988
MATT: "The deal was never changed."

00:41:58.988 --> 00:42:00.412
TRAVIS: Who's he talking to?

00:42:00.412 --> 00:42:02.368
MATT: "The deal was made."

00:42:02.368 --> 00:42:09.700
TALIESIN: I pull the gun away. Things have
changed. We need to talk.

00:42:09.700 --> 00:42:11.038
TRAVIS: All right?

00:42:11.038 --> 00:42:14.130
SAM: Who's he talking to?

00:42:14.130 --> 00:42:18.200
LIAM: I hold up my hand and shush the group with my
hand.

00:42:18.242 --> 00:42:24.434
MATT: "You made a great sacrifice for my gifts,
Percival. Do not let it be in vain."

00:42:24.434 --> 00:42:40.975
TALIESIN: (sighs) Did I even want revenge before
I talked to you? Did I? I don't remember anymore.

00:42:40.975 --> 00:42:57.245
What does she die for? What do I even need? I want
my country. I want my sister! I've killed two of

00:42:57.245 --> 00:43:06.319
those who have wronged me and nothing is better.
Nothing feels better, nothing is avenged. What is

00:43:06.319 --> 00:43:09.331
this worth to you? And I put the gun back at her
head.

00:43:09.331 --> 00:43:14.778
MATT: "Pull the trigger."

00:43:14.778 --> 00:43:17.013
TRAVIS: I take out my hammer...

00:43:17.013 --> 00:43:20.182
TALIESIN: Pull it back, put it to her, put it
back. "Maybe I will."

00:43:20.182 --> 00:43:23.608
MATT: You're placing the gun against your own
head?

00:43:23.608 --> 00:43:25.287
TALIESIN: And back to hers.

00:43:25.287 --> 00:43:27.555
LAURA: Percival, don't!

00:43:27.555 --> 00:43:29.005
MATT: "Percy, no!"

00:43:29.005 --> 00:43:38.951
"Percival, don't do this. We made a deal."

00:43:38.951 --> 00:43:50.576
TALIESIN: I put the gun to the side-- no, I'm
holding the gun on Briarwood. That deal was a

00:43:50.576 --> 00:43:55.421
soft deal. It was a dream. It was a vision.

00:43:55.421 --> 00:44:05.568
MATT: "What are visions if not a window into the
future? You understand so little, Percival. Do not

00:44:05.568 --> 00:44:09.141
"make me regret sharing this with you."

00:44:09.141 --> 00:44:15.912
TALIESIN: I need more from you if you want
anything from me. I don't trust you anymore.

00:44:15.912 --> 00:44:25.786
Besides. I put the gun to the hand of Lady
Briarwood and pull the trigger. The gun's broken

00:44:25.786 --> 00:44:39.426
anyway. I drop it. I'm not satisfied. I want my
money back.

00:44:39.426 --> 00:44:45.915
MATT: (chuckles) The smoke still billows out from
you at this point.

00:44:45.915 --> 00:44:48.789
TALIESIN: It's actually also still around her, it
occurs to me.

00:44:48.789 --> 00:44:54.071
MATT: Go ahead and make a wisdom saving throw.

00:44:54.071 --> 00:44:55.581
TALIESIN: Yep.

00:44:55.581 --> 00:44:57.565
MARISHA: (mumbles) You have advantage.

00:44:57.565 --> 00:44:59.452
TALIESIN: I have advantage! Thank you!

00:44:59.452 --> 00:45:00.769
MATT: You do.

00:45:00.769 --> 00:45:05.881
LIAM: I'm not doing anything, but I'm holding a
dagger and just watching Percy, and aiming at

00:45:05.881 --> 00:45:07.058
Percy.

00:45:07.058 --> 00:45:08.254
TALIESIN: Yay! 20.

00:45:08.254 --> 00:45:18.359
MATT: 20. You feel that warm pulse that was in your
hand earlier that was coming from the gun? It

00:45:18.391 --> 00:45:24.420
pulses like a heartbeat in the hand that was
holding it, and for a second you feel like

00:45:24.420 --> 00:45:31.422
something grabbed your wrist and slapped it away
towards your back, reaching for

00:45:31.422 --> 00:45:33.146
where Bad News is.

00:45:33.146 --> 00:45:34.295
TALIESIN: Which does work.

00:45:34.295 --> 00:45:38.119
MATT: And then you (grunts) rip control of your
hand once again.

00:45:38.119 --> 00:45:48.943
TALIESIN: Delilah. You are going to die tonight.
Whether or not it is a merciful, quick death or a

00:45:48.943 --> 00:45:55.642
slow and agonizing one, controlled by something
darker than I know, is entirely up to you. How do

00:45:55.642 --> 00:45:58.355
we stop that thing?!

00:45:58.355 --> 00:46:02.979
MATT: Delilah, whose eyes are still rolling after
all the shouting that's been going on as she comes

00:46:02.979 --> 00:46:11.260
into consciousness with a gag around her mouth and
goes (breathes heavily, struggling) And her eyes

00:46:11.260 --> 00:46:17.393
dart around in fear. You can see that her makeup
has run down her cheeks from her own lamenting

00:46:17.393 --> 00:46:22.470
over Sylas's loss and the confusion over the
ritual. And the fear all of a sudden turns to

00:46:22.516 --> 00:46:27.257
seething, burning hatred as they dart around. And
then (struggles again). She can't talk.

00:46:27.257 --> 00:46:30.262
SAM: I will Mage Hand to remove the gag from her.

00:46:30.262 --> 00:46:32.447
LAURA: Oh god! I pull an arrow and aim it right at
her head.

00:46:32.447 --> 00:46:35.583
MARISHA: Yeah, I prep my fire hands.

00:46:35.583 --> 00:46:41.360
TALIESIN: I know the pain you're feeling right
now. I know the rage. I know every moment of it,

00:46:41.360 --> 00:46:51.480
and I guarantee I can make it worse. I can make it
so much worse. Fix this. And join your beloved.

00:46:51.480 --> 00:47:05.862
MATT: As this is happening, the gag falls away
from her mouth from the magic hand. She's glancing

00:47:05.862 --> 00:47:09.986
at you and the smoke is now billowing up stronger
to the point where you can barely see Percy's

00:47:09.986 --> 00:47:15.833
torso. You can see his head now, and what little
bit of a view you have, his eyes have gone

00:47:15.833 --> 00:47:21.565
completely dark. There is just pitch black,
completely encasing the entirety of his visible

00:47:21.565 --> 00:47:26.143
eye. You can see his feet still dangling beneath
the smoke, and his feet are digging and tensed

00:47:26.143 --> 00:47:27.424
into the ground.

00:47:27.424 --> 00:47:29.542
TALIESIN: Delilah, don't make me hurt you.

00:47:29.542 --> 00:47:37.903
MARISHA: I reach over and I grab Vex's hand. And I
look at her and I say, what do we do?

00:47:37.903 --> 00:47:39.897
TALIESIN: Grog, be ready to restrain me.

00:47:39.897 --> 00:47:41.212
TRAVIS: I'm ready!

00:47:41.212 --> 00:47:48.428
LAURA: Percival Frederickstein von Musel
Klossowski de Rolo III, you will fight this

00:47:48.428 --> 00:47:50.198
monster inside of you!

00:47:50.198 --> 00:47:56.354
MATT: Delilah is looking at you right now and the
anger and fury in her eyes clarified, she just

00:47:56.354 --> 00:48:00.179
looks up and, "You've already taken everything
from me."

00:48:00.179 --> 00:48:06.970
TALIESIN: I really haven't. You still have your
sanity and your life. I will take your life

00:48:06.970 --> 00:48:08.885
tonight, but I can leave you your sanity.

00:48:08.885 --> 00:48:16.616
MATT: "Interesting. You seem to be struggling,
Percy."

00:48:16.616 --> 00:48:25.947
TALIESIN: Okay, I'm going to be an asshole. Fine.
Fine. Casting Minor Illusion.

00:48:25.947 --> 00:48:26.983
MATT: Okay.

00:48:26.983 --> 00:48:33.288
TALIESIN: I'm changing my form into the screaming,
writhing, slowly-melting visage of Lord

00:48:33.288 --> 00:48:34.451
Briarwood.

00:48:34.451 --> 00:48:36.048
LAURA: Oh shit!

00:48:36.048 --> 00:48:41.075
TALIESIN: And I'm just going to scream in holy
high hell and pain.

00:48:41.075 --> 00:48:42.413
MATT: Okay.

00:48:42.413 --> 00:48:45.514
TALIESIN: Suck it, girl!

00:48:45.514 --> 00:48:49.180
MATT: So Minor Illusion, as a limitation, it
wouldn't be a full-body illusion, but you can take

00:48:49.180 --> 00:48:50.671
elements of your features.

00:48:50.671 --> 00:48:52.049
TALIESIN: I'm in smoke. I'm just taking--

00:48:52.049 --> 00:49:00.488
MATT: Yeah. Where once Percy's face existed, it
twists into this shimmering apparition of Sylas

00:49:00.488 --> 00:49:06.908
Briarwood looking down at her as his face contorts
into horrible, screaming pain. The head rises up

00:49:06.908 --> 00:49:12.688
and almost soundlessly, he screams out as the
flesh begins to melt from the bone. As it does,

00:49:12.688 --> 00:49:16.935
Percy's voice rings out in this cacophonous roar
that shakes the cavern around you.

00:49:16.935 --> 00:49:22.642
TALIESIN: That pain you're feeling, I've felt for
years. Don't think I've imagined every way to hurt

00:49:22.642 --> 00:49:36.055
you! I could spend years hurting you before you
die, in ways you cannot imagine. Now, how do we

00:49:36.055 --> 00:49:40.873
stop it?

00:49:40.873 --> 00:49:46.874
MATT: "I don't know. I don't even know if it
worked. We've been preparing for this ritual

00:49:46.874 --> 00:50:01.245
"for... five godforsaken years. All to repay a
debt. And that's all. You forced us.

00:50:01.245 --> 00:50:03.482
"It was too soon."

00:50:03.482 --> 00:50:08.475
TALIESIN: Why? Why was it too soon? What were you
waiting for?

00:50:08.475 --> 00:50:19.736
MATT: "We were waiting for a particular date.
There is a time each year in which the barriers

00:50:19.736 --> 00:50:34.429
"between realms grow and grow very weak. You recall
Erevan's attempt generations ago to blur between

00:50:34.429 --> 00:50:48.208
"the realm of ice and this one, which you call the
Winter's Crest. Well, this is too early, and you

00:50:48.208 --> 00:51:04.434
"saw our failure. He will not be happy, I imagine.
And I still owe him for what he gave me. For what

00:51:04.434 --> 00:51:06.039
"he gave us."

00:51:06.039 --> 00:51:10.810
LAURA: What did he give you?

00:51:10.810 --> 00:51:27.508
MATT: At which point, her eyes well up with tears,
and she looks over. "He gave me my Sylas back. And

00:51:27.508 --> 00:51:45.475
"you took him from me again. So do what you must
do. I know I've paid my penance, and I know that

00:51:45.475 --> 00:51:49.684
"no matter what steps you take now, it will only
drag you deeper into this dark hole you've drawn

00:51:49.684 --> 00:51:52.908
"yourselves. And you will hear me laughing."

00:51:52.908 --> 00:51:58.008
TALIESIN: No, I really won't. Knock her out
again.

00:51:58.008 --> 00:52:01.324
TRAVIS: Oh. Fine! (punching sound)

00:52:01.324 --> 00:52:02.600
MATT: Make a strength check.

00:52:02.600 --> 00:52:06.689
TRAVIS: 19.

00:52:06.689 --> 00:52:14.119
MATT: 19? (impact noise) You hear (clinking)
across some of the lower rocks as two of her teeth

00:52:14.119 --> 00:52:16.428
go scattering out the side of her mouth.

00:52:16.428 --> 00:52:17.692
TALIESIN: Collect them.

00:52:17.692 --> 00:52:21.484
TRAVIS: They're not pointy, right?

00:52:21.484 --> 00:52:22.372
MATT: No.

00:52:22.372 --> 00:52:24.282
TALIESIN: Check her person for anything.

00:52:24.282 --> 00:52:28.474
LAURA: Oh, I will gladly do that for you.

00:52:28.474 --> 00:52:30.988
TRAVIS: Hold on a second. Are you sure you don't
want to smoke this bitch?

00:52:30.988 --> 00:52:33.640
LAURA: I check her person for anything valuable.

00:52:33.640 --> 00:52:35.386
TALIESIN: I think we're just going to throw her
into the acid pits.

00:52:35.386 --> 00:52:40.750
No, I don't feel...

00:52:40.790 --> 00:52:45.237
LIAM: What's the plan here, Percy?

00:52:45.237 --> 00:52:49.852
SAM: I pick up the Pepperbox off the floor to give
it to him, and I try to sneak out a bullet.

00:52:49.852 --> 00:52:51.702
TALIESIN: They're different bullets.

00:52:51.772 --> 00:52:53.261
SAM: I don't know that!

00:52:53.261 --> 00:52:55.854
MATT: Okay. Make a sleight of hand check.

00:52:55.854 --> 00:52:57.869
SAM: Three!

00:52:57.869 --> 00:52:58.824
TRAVIS: Shit!

00:52:58.824 --> 00:53:01.370
SAM: Plus two! Plus two.

00:53:01.370 --> 00:53:02.510
MATT: So five. (giggles)

00:53:02.510 --> 00:53:07.275
TALIESIN: The three, in theory, is actually low
enough to break it further.

00:53:07.275 --> 00:53:08.508
MATT: Make a perception check.

00:53:08.508 --> 00:53:11.019
MARISHA: Plus two, it's five.

00:53:11.019 --> 00:53:12.308
TALIESIN: Fine.

00:53:12.308 --> 00:53:13.574
LIAM: Natural one.

00:53:13.574 --> 00:53:15.451
TALIESIN: Nope. That's a 16.

00:53:15.451 --> 00:53:24.688
MATT: So you watch as Scanlan looks around, grabs
it. Picks it up and (clink) the full barrel comes

00:53:24.688 --> 00:53:26.331
off of the gun.

00:53:26.331 --> 00:53:29.022
SAM: I back away from it.

00:53:29.022 --> 00:53:32.662
LAURA: You guys, he's got smoke billowing out of
him right now.

00:53:32.662 --> 00:53:36.324
SAM: Kick it off away to the corner.

00:53:36.324 --> 00:53:40.030
TALIESIN: Scanlan. Give me the other gun.

00:53:40.030 --> 00:53:43.856
SAM: Oh, it's on the floor right there.

00:53:43.856 --> 00:53:45.489
TALIESIN: The other gun.

00:53:45.489 --> 00:53:52.218
SAM: You were talking to something out there. What
was it? I was very scared. I'm a little man!

00:53:52.218 --> 00:53:54.005
TRAVIS: Just change the subject.

00:53:54.005 --> 00:53:56.213
SAM: Who were you talking to?

00:53:56.213 --> 00:53:57.551
TALIESIN: I need another gun.

00:53:57.551 --> 00:54:01.175
SAM: Are you going to kill me with it?

00:54:01.175 --> 00:54:03.921
(laughter)

00:54:03.921 --> 00:54:05.665
TALIESIN: Maybe?

00:54:05.665 --> 00:54:09.862
LIAM: I walk between them and say, Percy, what
are we doing here? That woman deserves everything

00:54:09.862 --> 00:54:15.663
that is brought upon her, but what are we doing
for Whitestone? What are we doing?

00:54:15.663 --> 00:54:20.793
MARISHA: More importantly, what was that just
now?! Who were you talking to?

00:54:20.793 --> 00:54:21.850
TALIESIN: I don't know.

00:54:21.850 --> 00:54:23.248
MARISHA: What?!

00:54:23.248 --> 00:54:24.918
TALIESIN: Things have gotten a bit weird.

00:54:24.918 --> 00:54:30.705
MARISHA: Percy, you cannot honestly tell us you
don't know anymore! We just watched you have a

00:54:30.705 --> 00:54:33.017
full-fledged conversation with yourself!

00:54:33.017 --> 00:54:35.386
TALIESIN: Did they not hear any of the voice?

00:54:35.386 --> 00:54:37.481
LIAM: Yeah, was he talking out loud?

00:54:37.481 --> 00:54:40.187
TALIESIN: Oh shit, I came off like a crazy person
just then!

00:54:40.187 --> 00:54:42.323
TRAVIS: You did! Yes, you did.

00:54:42.323 --> 00:54:44.260
SAM: Here's what I know.

00:54:44.260 --> 00:54:46.221
TRAVIS: We were trying to answer you for a little
bit.

00:54:46.221 --> 00:54:52.390
SAM: Here's what I know. Vecna is possibly, maybe
on the loose, maybe coming back. We know that this

00:54:52.390 --> 00:54:56.803
ritual has been started, and we don't know whether
killing her is going to end it or not. So I

00:54:56.803 --> 00:54:58.990
propose that we start leaving right away.

00:54:58.990 --> 00:55:01.485
LAURA: Pike, do you know anything about Vecna?

00:55:01.485 --> 00:55:03.635
MARISHA: Anything further?

00:55:03.635 --> 00:55:10.412
MATT: Pike, you go ahead and make a religion
check.

00:55:10.412 --> 00:55:12.667
SAM: Matt, fly to New York to whisper in her ear.

00:55:12.667 --> 00:55:13.871
(laughter)

00:55:13.871 --> 00:55:15.208
MATT: It's tempting.

00:55:15.208 --> 00:55:17.450
MARISHA: Yeah, just text her!

00:55:17.450 --> 00:55:19.179
LIAM: 47!

00:55:19.179 --> 00:55:20.353
ASHLEY: 17.

00:55:20.353 --> 00:55:27.009
MATT: 17, okay. Not a whole lot more information
than what Scanlan was able to ascertain from

00:55:27.042 --> 00:55:32.579
this. You just know that this entity known as
Vecna, once a very powerful arch-lich, had once

00:55:32.579 --> 00:55:40.096
attempted to ascend to godhood, and was supposedly
halted in the process, a battle that occurred on

00:55:40.096 --> 00:55:47.342
another plane, amongst heroes that only a few came
back from, but apparently stopped a very terrible

00:55:47.342 --> 00:55:52.044
thing. But that was hundreds and hundreds of years
ago.

00:55:52.044 --> 00:55:55.154
MARISHA: I wonder what Erevan has to do with
this.

00:55:55.154 --> 00:55:58.878
LAURA: And he created a vampire? He made Sylas a
vampire?

00:55:58.878 --> 00:56:01.160
MATT: You do know that-- sorry.

00:56:01.160 --> 00:56:02.171
MARISHA: Go ahead.

00:56:02.171 --> 00:56:11.560
MATT: You do know, and Pike relays this too. In
particular, Vecna is known as, for lack of a

00:56:11.596 --> 00:56:22.106
better term, the patron saint-- or lesser god to
those who worship-- as the deity of secrets. Dark

00:56:22.106 --> 00:56:30.629
secrets, things that wish to be kept out of the
knowledge of most of the world at large. And

00:56:30.629 --> 00:56:33.518
these secrets are coveted.

00:56:33.557 --> 00:56:35.237
ASHLEY: Jeez.

00:56:35.237 --> 00:56:44.554
TALIESIN: Things are complex, and I don't trust
myself to take her life. I'm in over my head.

00:56:44.554 --> 00:56:46.472
LAURA: Do you need someone else to do it for you?

00:56:46.472 --> 00:56:48.614
TALIESIN: I don't know if that will help.

00:56:48.614 --> 00:56:53.318
TRAVIS: She almost killed Vex, she didn't kill
Vax, we've got to do fucking something with her.

00:56:53.318 --> 00:56:56.821
TALIESIN: This thing wants her dead, and the only
thing I can think to do is to say no.

00:56:56.821 --> 00:56:59.988
LIAM: This thing? What thing?

00:57:00.030 --> 00:57:01.836
TALIESIN: This thing in my head--

00:57:01.874 --> 00:57:03.296
LAURA: Your thing?!

00:57:03.296 --> 00:57:05.366
LIAM: What thing is that, Percival?

00:57:05.366 --> 00:57:06.525
TALIESIN: I don't know!

00:57:06.525 --> 00:57:11.152
LIAM: Well, start fucking talking, Percival,
because we've all watched you talk to yourself for

00:57:11.152 --> 00:57:14.473
five straight minutes, and we're not going to deal
with it for much longer!

00:57:14.473 --> 00:57:16.515
MARISHA: Sorry, Percy. I'm with Vax, here.

00:57:16.515 --> 00:57:20.123
TALIESIN: I had a dream, and that was all.

00:57:20.123 --> 00:57:27.248
MARISHA: You mentioned just now that you wanted
your money back. Was this a dream? Did you pay

00:57:27.248 --> 00:57:30.785
somebody? And with what?

00:57:30.785 --> 00:57:38.873
TALIESIN: It was a dream where I was offered a
means to revenge. It was a dream!

00:57:38.873 --> 00:57:41.288
MARISHA: Well, clearly it wasn't!

00:57:41.288 --> 00:57:42.937
TALIESIN: Well, I know that now.

00:57:42.937 --> 00:57:44.144
LIAM: Percival.

00:57:44.144 --> 00:57:46.300
TALIESIN: This is as new to me as anyone.

00:57:46.300 --> 00:57:49.104
LIAM: It feels like you are lying to us.

00:57:49.104 --> 00:57:50.827
MARISHA: Can I do an insight check on him?

00:57:50.827 --> 00:57:51.878
TALIESIN: Please.

00:57:51.878 --> 00:57:54.706
LAURA: (laughs) "Let me know if I'm lying,
because--"

00:57:54.706 --> 00:57:56.864
MARISHA: Fucking fuck!

00:57:56.864 --> 00:57:59.016
TALIESIN: Why do you all keep rolling so poorly
against me?

00:57:59.016 --> 00:58:00.711
MARISHA: 16.

00:58:00.711 --> 00:58:10.054
MATT: Taliesin, tell me what your persuasion and
deception skills are.

00:58:10.054 --> 00:58:12.448
TALIESIN: Persuasion six, deception two.

00:58:12.448 --> 00:58:18.921
LAURA: 23! Ooh! Two in one!

00:58:18.921 --> 00:58:20.445
TRAVIS: You got a whisper?!

00:58:20.445 --> 00:58:23.244
MATT: Inter-party insight.

00:58:23.244 --> 00:58:26.146
MARISHA: We have to title this "Whispers!"

00:58:26.146 --> 00:58:27.518
TRAVIS: Whispers!

00:58:27.518 --> 00:58:29.900
TALIESIN: I think we've already had an episode
called "Whispers."

00:58:29.900 --> 00:58:33.799
SAM: Well, this one's called "Secrets and Lies!"

00:58:33.799 --> 00:58:35.324
LIAM: This one's called "Whisper-Sync."

00:58:35.324 --> 00:58:37.275
TALIESIN: "Ear-tonguing."

00:58:37.275 --> 00:58:39.773
SAM: This one's called just (whisper noises).

00:58:39.773 --> 00:58:43.834
TRAVIS: For the record, I like the shadow stuff.

00:58:43.834 --> 00:58:45.538
MARISHA: (squeals) I get one, too!

00:58:45.538 --> 00:58:47.611
SAM: He whispers to you all the time.

00:58:47.611 --> 00:58:53.282
(laughter)

00:58:53.282 --> 00:58:55.935
LAURA: It looks like there was more tongue with
you, though, Sam.

00:58:55.935 --> 00:58:57.806
MATT: Way to point that out.

00:58:57.806 --> 00:58:59.734
TRAVIS: Didn't get sufficient tongue in yours?

00:58:59.734 --> 00:59:09.368
TALIESIN: You don't seem very satisfied.

00:59:09.368 --> 00:59:13.506
SAM: Remember, these shirts are available online
at geekandsundry.com!

00:59:13.506 --> 00:59:16.726
LAURA: I knew you were going to do that. I almost
did it when he was whispering in your ear, just

00:59:16.726 --> 00:59:17.801
for your sake!

00:59:17.801 --> 00:59:24.985
MATT: I would also like you to make another
wisdom saving throw.

00:59:25.029 --> 00:59:28.861
SAM: Oh shit.

00:59:28.861 --> 00:59:29.982
TALIESIN: Natural 20!

00:59:29.982 --> 00:59:31.971
TRAVIS: (yelling) Shut the fuck up!

00:59:31.971 --> 00:59:34.101
TALIESIN: Breaking the game!

00:59:34.101 --> 00:59:36.850
TRAVIS: What the-- what?!

00:59:36.850 --> 00:59:46.700
MATT: At this point, you feel your hands tense up,
and once again begin to reach towards your back. You

00:59:46.740 --> 00:59:54.019
close your eyes and with all your will and might,
you just scream "No!" Instinctively, it wasn't

00:59:54.019 --> 00:59:58.849
even a conscious thought, it was just an
animalistic response to feeling your physical form

00:59:58.849 --> 01:00:03.417
being taken over, and in that moment, every muscle
in your body tenses.

01:00:03.417 --> 01:00:09.929
And you guys watch the smoke momentarily drift
from his form behind him.

01:00:09.929 --> 01:00:11.599
LAURA: Behind him?

01:00:11.599 --> 01:00:13.274
TRAVIS: Off of him.

01:00:13.274 --> 01:00:18.489
SAM: You don't need to yell at us, Percy. We're
just trying to help you.

01:00:18.489 --> 01:00:21.121
TRAVIS: The smoke dissipates or goes behind him?

01:00:21.121 --> 01:00:22.619
SAM: I don't think he's rational.

01:00:22.619 --> 01:00:23.899
MATT: Behind him.

01:00:23.899 --> 01:00:28.308
LIAM: I'm aiming at the smoke and just watching
and waiting.

01:00:28.437 --> 01:00:39.157
MATT: At this point, you can see this smoke that
was once billowing from Percy is now standing in

01:00:39.157 --> 01:00:41.345
this outer human-like shape.

01:00:41.345 --> 01:00:43.789
SAM: Unbeam-say!

01:00:43.789 --> 01:00:48.054
MARISHA: Cashed out-say.

01:00:48.054 --> 01:00:54.574
MATT: As it stands there for a moment, it begins
to swell and grow larger, filling almost the

01:00:54.574 --> 01:01:00.560
height of the ten-foot tunnel that you guys are
standing in, looming over Percy's body, still

01:01:00.560 --> 01:01:06.461
connected through his shadow through the floor of
the tunnel itself. It just looms over and as it

01:01:06.461 --> 01:01:11.223
peeks forward, you guys for the first time hear
the voice that's been poking through him this

01:01:11.223 --> 01:01:16.944
entire time just say, "Percival. Do it."

01:01:16.944 --> 01:01:18.845
LAURA: I shoot a holy arrow at it.

01:01:18.845 --> 01:01:20.241
MATT: Then let's roll some initiative.

01:01:20.241 --> 01:01:22.542
(yelling)

01:01:22.542 --> 01:01:27.262
MARISHA: We're fighting the thing that's been in
your head!

01:01:27.262 --> 01:01:29.121
TALIESIN: Therapy!

01:01:29.121 --> 01:01:30.276
MARISHA: There's so many allegories!

01:01:30.276 --> 01:01:31.329
TALIESIN: Therapy!

01:01:31.329 --> 01:01:33.797
MARISHA: We're fighting the demons in your head.

01:01:33.797 --> 01:01:37.350
MATT: (laughs) That's pretty great, actually.

01:01:37.350 --> 01:01:39.979
TALIESIN: My therapist would be so proud right
now.

01:01:39.979 --> 01:01:47.894
LAURA: Oh man, we're out of like everything,
aren't we?

01:01:47.894 --> 01:01:48.792
LIAM: Yes.

01:01:48.792 --> 01:01:50.270
TRAVIS: Oh, we're great, we're fine, we're good.

01:01:50.270 --> 01:01:51.741
SAM: We got a guy with a hammer. We're fine.

01:01:51.741 --> 01:01:57.636
LAURA: Oh jeez, okay. Well, I've still got two
3rd-level spells.

01:01:57.636 --> 01:02:00.933
TALIESIN: I need stats on Lord Briarwood's sword.

01:02:00.933 --> 01:02:04.284
MATT: You haven't taken a short rest.

01:02:04.284 --> 01:02:07.167
SAM: You know what we have? We have fucking Pike.

01:02:07.167 --> 01:02:08.262
LAURA: We have Pike!

01:02:08.262 --> 01:02:10.082
TRAVIS: Yeah, we do! We've got Pike!

01:02:10.082 --> 01:02:14.178
ASHLEY: Yeah, I'm pretty low on spells, guys, but
we're going to be okay.

01:02:14.178 --> 01:02:19.827
TALIESIN: I have been dreading this for years.

01:02:19.827 --> 01:02:21.418
LIAM: What? What have you been dreading?

01:02:21.418 --> 01:02:22.884
TALIESIN: This moment right now.

01:02:22.884 --> 01:02:26.621
LAURA: Oh my god, this has been in him for three
years, four years.

01:02:26.621 --> 01:02:29.237
MARISHA: Forever! Since the beginning.

01:02:29.237 --> 01:02:31.835
TALIESIN: Since you've met me.

01:02:31.835 --> 01:02:34.223
TRAVIS: I've been standing in front of Lady
Briarwood.

01:02:34.223 --> 01:02:35.801
MATT: Yeah. So right there with her.

01:02:35.801 --> 01:02:43.034
TALIESIN: I'm either going to be a new Percy or a
new person entirely.

01:02:43.034 --> 01:02:44.383
LAURA: No, don't say that.

01:02:44.383 --> 01:02:47.314
TALIESIN: I'm so sorry. It's so fun to torture
you.

01:02:47.314 --> 01:02:54.171
SAM: As everyone's drawing their weapons, I shout,
maybe we should check and make sure it won't kill

01:02:54.171 --> 01:02:56.253
him if we kill it.

01:02:56.253 --> 01:02:57.745
LAURA: It's too late. I shot an arrow at it!

01:02:57.745 --> 01:03:00.425
MATT: It's too late. Who's standing where? I'm
going to say Pike's probably--

01:03:00.425 --> 01:03:02.930
TALIESIN: You have a little cavern for this!

01:03:02.930 --> 01:03:04.021
LIAM: Where's Percy?

01:03:04.021 --> 01:03:10.267
MATT: Percy is currently right here. Well, more in
the center there talking to everybody.

01:03:10.318 --> 01:03:17.036
TALIESIN: Do you have a mini for the dark
specter of my soul? I love you!

01:03:17.036 --> 01:03:18.905
I love you so much!

01:03:18.905 --> 01:03:22.257
MATT: With Cassandra on the ground there.

01:03:22.257 --> 01:03:25.310
LIAM: I'm next to Vex.

01:03:25.310 --> 01:03:30.288
MATT: Right, so you guys would be probably back
here. Your daggers ready. Trinket is probably over

01:03:30.288 --> 01:03:31.366
by you, of course.

01:03:31.366 --> 01:03:32.355
LAURA: Yeah, of course he is.

01:03:32.355 --> 01:03:35.060
MATT: And Keyleth? I'd say you're probably on this
side, talking to Percy.

01:03:35.060 --> 01:03:39.212
LAURA: Oh wait, but we were holding hands at one
point, so we would be close.

01:03:39.212 --> 01:03:44.332
TALIESIN: And Grog was covering me, so Grog
would've been closer to me, because I had him--

01:03:44.332 --> 01:03:47.096
TRAVIS: Yeah, I was in front of Lady Briarwood,
though.

01:03:47.096 --> 01:03:49.273
MATT: I have you right here between him and Lady
Briarwood. Right there.

01:03:49.273 --> 01:03:50.570
LAURA: That seems good, we're good.

01:03:50.570 --> 01:03:55.842
LIAM: Do I have a clear shot, not that I'm going
to do it, but I was aiming at Percy, so I would

01:03:55.842 --> 01:03:57.759
have a clear line of sight. Is there nothing
between us?

01:03:57.759 --> 01:04:01.669
MATT: You would have a clear line of sight. The
two gnomes are between you, so you're fine.

01:04:01.669 --> 01:04:03.668
TALIESIN: I am so happy right now.

01:04:03.668 --> 01:04:05.009
LAURA: How did my holy arrow do?

01:04:05.009 --> 01:04:11.368
MATT: We're going to find out in just a second.
So, first and foremost, initiative order. We have

01:04:11.368 --> 01:04:13.661
25 to 20?

01:04:13.661 --> 01:04:14.928
LAURA: 25.

01:04:14.928 --> 01:04:18.194
MATT: Wow, okay, so we have Vex.

01:04:18.194 --> 01:04:19.099
SAM: 20.

01:04:19.099 --> 01:04:26.178
MATT: Two 20s. 19 to 15?

01:04:26.178 --> 01:04:27.453
LIAM: 19.

01:04:27.453 --> 01:04:28.428
MATT: 19.

01:04:28.428 --> 01:04:29.404
MARISHA: 16.

01:04:29.404 --> 01:04:30.629
MATT: 16, okay.

01:04:30.629 --> 01:04:32.275
MARISHA: I didn't suck it up this game.

01:04:32.275 --> 01:04:36.321
MATT: 15 to ten?

01:04:36.321 --> 01:04:37.594
TRAVIS: 17.

01:04:37.594 --> 01:04:39.336
MATT: 17. Oh, 17, all right.

01:04:39.336 --> 01:04:40.874
TRAVIS: Oh, sorry, did I miss that section?

01:04:40.874 --> 01:04:43.116
MATT: You did. That's okay. Pike, what did you
get?

01:04:43.116 --> 01:04:44.168
ASHLEY: Eight!

01:04:44.168 --> 01:04:51.557
MATT: Eight! Yeah! All right. First and foremost,
Vex, you're up with the initiative on this. You go

01:04:51.557 --> 01:04:53.469
ahead and you bring your holy arrow and you
release it.

01:04:53.469 --> 01:04:54.692
LAURA: Is it a surprise attack?

01:04:54.692 --> 01:04:59.961
MATT: Technically, no, it knew you were there, it
was very aware of everyone's position. And was

01:04:59.961 --> 01:05:03.355
essentially after being forced out of his body at
the moment preparing itself for some sort of

01:05:03.355 --> 01:05:07.218
assault, so not a surprise round, unfortunately.
So go ahead and make your attacks with your

01:05:07.218 --> 01:05:11.582
arrows, if you'd like.

01:05:11.582 --> 01:05:15.071
LAURA: Yes! 28 and 27.

01:05:15.071 --> 01:05:16.741
MATT: Both of those hit.

01:05:16.741 --> 01:05:29.710
LAURA: Awesome. Okay. These two... balls. So 15,
16, 17, plus holy damage?

01:05:29.710 --> 01:05:39.693
MATT: I'll consider that, do 1d4 radiant damage to
it. In addition to that, so 17 plus--

01:05:39.693 --> 01:05:41.702
LAURA: 17 plus four is 21.

01:05:41.702 --> 01:05:43.000
MATT: 21 for the first one.

01:05:43.000 --> 01:05:46.540
LAURA: And then ten for the second.

01:05:46.540 --> 01:05:48.021
MATT: All right. So--

01:05:48.021 --> 01:05:49.956
LAURA: And then I Hunter's Mark him.

01:05:49.956 --> 01:05:51.046
MATT: All righty.

01:05:51.046 --> 01:05:58.446
LAURA: I didn't say I Hunter's Marked him at the
beginning-- I'm explaining this to you guys,

01:05:58.446 --> 01:06:00.441
because I'd already said I shot at him.

01:06:00.441 --> 01:06:01.415
MATT: You did.

01:06:01.415 --> 01:06:05.831
LAURA: So I was being honest. I'm looking at the
chat room, because I know they're going to tell me

01:06:05.831 --> 01:06:07.248
I forgot my damn Hunter's Mark.

01:06:07.248 --> 01:06:12.631
MATT: That's okay. All right. You pull back and
release the first arrow. As it goes and hits, you

01:06:12.631 --> 01:06:16.000
can see the smoke itself is obscuring its place
and keeping it hard to hit, but you still strike

01:06:16.000 --> 01:06:20.563
true, the arrow striking into its form. And
there's a flash of radiant energy as it hits, and

01:06:20.563 --> 01:06:25.250
you see the creature takes from the impact and
stares down at its chest. As it looks up, its face

01:06:25.250 --> 01:06:31.036
turning towards you, and it is this formless
humanoid body, but the face itself does pinch into

01:06:31.036 --> 01:06:34.822
this elongated crow skull--

01:06:34.822 --> 01:06:36.763
LAURA: Ooh, I didn't do holy damage for the second
one!

01:06:36.763 --> 01:06:39.281
SAM: Did the arrows hit?

01:06:39.281 --> 01:06:41.865
LAURA: Yeah. Plus two more for the holy damage.

01:06:41.865 --> 01:06:42.971
SAM: They impacted?

01:06:42.971 --> 01:06:44.537
MATT: They impacted.

01:06:44.537 --> 01:06:46.550
SAM: Okay.

01:06:46.550 --> 01:06:56.082
MATT: All right. Takes both the hits and looks
over at you, and you can see as it turns the head,

01:06:56.082 --> 01:07:00.533
you can see better, even in this low light, the
shape of its face, and its eyes burst into this

01:07:00.533 --> 01:07:06.961
angry burning purplish energy expression and it
looks very unhappy with the current circumstance.

01:07:06.961 --> 01:07:09.190
Do you want to move you or Trinket?

01:07:09.190 --> 01:07:18.641
LAURA: Trinket moves around and in front of me to
protect me.

01:07:18.641 --> 01:07:22.766
MATT: Okay. There you go. That's it, you're just
going to keep there?

01:07:22.766 --> 01:07:23.710
LAURA: Yeah.

01:07:23.710 --> 01:07:25.795
MATT: All right. That ends your turn. Scanlan,
you're up next.

01:07:25.795 --> 01:07:27.182
SAM: How tall is the tunnel?

01:07:27.182 --> 01:07:29.796
MATT: It's about 12 feet.

01:07:29.796 --> 01:07:43.351
SAM: Okay. No? Okay. Precious little I can do. I
will Lightning Bolt it. Ooh,

01:07:43.351 --> 01:07:44.724
I'm right next to it.

01:07:44.724 --> 01:07:47.649
MATT: You are, which means you could blast towards
the wall and hit it.

01:07:47.649 --> 01:07:51.989
SAM: All right. I will turn around and I will, I
will Lightning Bolt it, yes.

01:07:51.989 --> 01:07:56.553
MATT: Okay. All right. So you, it's right there in
front of you as the smoke rises up, and you see

01:07:56.553 --> 01:07:59.883
the arrows strike it, there's the flash of holy
energy from Vex's attack, and that moment, as it's

01:07:59.883 --> 01:08:03.401
distracted, you use that to conjure a lightning
bolt and (lightning sound). For a moment, the

01:08:03.401 --> 01:08:07.846
flashing of light lights up the cavern around. The
bolt passes through it harmlessly.

01:08:07.846 --> 01:08:10.247
MARISHA: What? What did you, what was that?

01:08:10.247 --> 01:08:11.234
SAM: Lightning.

01:08:11.234 --> 01:08:15.120
LAURA: Either or magic. One of the two didn't
affect it.

01:08:15.120 --> 01:08:19.811
MATT: The lightning bolt passes through it and it
strikes the back of the wall and you can see the

01:08:19.811 --> 01:08:24.982
electrical energy discharge across the stone and
earth, arcing and spidering off until it

01:08:25.018 --> 01:08:31.024
dissipates, seeming to not have any sort of impact
or effect on the billowing smoke entity.

01:08:31.024 --> 01:08:32.757
SAM: Shit.

01:08:32.757 --> 01:08:37.302
MATT: You want to stay there or you want to move?
You are in its melee range. You are in its melee

01:08:37.302 --> 01:08:39.745
range, so if you move it will get an attack of
opportunity if it chooses to take it.

01:08:39.745 --> 01:08:55.066
SAM: (stammers) I will not move and instead I will
inspire Percy.

01:08:55.066 --> 01:08:56.241
MATT: Okay.

01:08:56.241 --> 01:09:00.881
SAM: And I'll say, you feel good in this
motherfucker! Your whole hood in this

01:09:00.881 --> 01:09:02.553
motherfucker! (laughs) That's it.

01:09:02.553 --> 01:09:04.172
(laughter)

01:09:04.172 --> 01:09:09.461
MATT: All right, take your d10. This moment of
intensity, as you turn around now at this point,

01:09:09.461 --> 01:09:13.496
seeing everyone striking, you've looked your head
over and you can see for the first time in full

01:09:13.496 --> 01:09:20.191
physical form, the creature that has haunted your
dreams for the past five years. While it is not

01:09:20.191 --> 01:09:23.606
present, you can feel it smile. It's your turn.

01:09:23.606 --> 01:09:37.768
TALIESIN: I'm going to run over to my sister.

01:09:37.768 --> 01:09:39.206
MATT: Okay.

01:09:39.206 --> 01:09:43.679
TALIESIN: And cut open her bonds.

01:09:43.679 --> 01:09:46.640
MATT: Okay, so you pull out the-- okay.

01:09:46.640 --> 01:09:54.590
TALIESIN: Take out my sword and cut open her
bonds. Get back! Run! And then, if I still have

01:09:54.590 --> 01:09:58.170
enough timing beyond that, I'd love to take a
swipe at it with my sword.

01:09:58.170 --> 01:10:03.490
MATT: Unfortunately, it's going to, to free her
entirely of her bonds and give her that, it's

01:10:03.490 --> 01:10:04.606
going to be your action.

01:10:04.606 --> 01:10:08.505
TALIESIN: Okay. We haven't had a short rest, have
we?

01:10:08.505 --> 01:10:09.683
MATT, LAURA, and MARISHA: No.

01:10:09.683 --> 01:10:11.604
MATT: I know.

01:10:11.604 --> 01:10:13.608
MARISHA: We're not looking good.

01:10:13.608 --> 01:10:19.453
MATT: All right. It is now Vax's turn.

01:10:19.453 --> 01:10:23.603
LIAM: Oh? Good. So I've got advantage because the
smoke demon hasn't gone yet, so dagger and a

01:10:23.603 --> 01:10:35.516
dagger. First one is, that's 29, and the second
one is a 24, so 29 and 24.

01:10:35.516 --> 01:10:38.839
MATT: What's giving you advantage on this? Because
he hasn't gone first in the first round? That is

01:10:38.873 --> 01:10:41.397
correct, yes. All right. So both of those hit.

01:10:41.397 --> 01:10:46.494
LIAM: The first one is eight and the second one is
eight.

01:10:46.494 --> 01:10:47.463
MATT: Okay.

01:10:47.463 --> 01:10:49.924
LIAM: Keen dagger, life-stealing.

01:10:49.924 --> 01:10:54.229
MATT: Right. Do you want to sneak attack with
this? Because in theory, it's in melee range with

01:10:54.229 --> 01:10:55.168
an ally.

01:10:55.168 --> 01:10:56.174
LIAM: Oh, with Percy.

01:10:56.174 --> 01:10:57.423
MATT: With Percy and with Scanlan.

01:10:57.423 --> 01:10:58.967
LIAM: Thanks, boss! Yeah.

01:10:58.967 --> 01:11:01.764
MATT: Don't rob yourself of what you do.

01:11:01.764 --> 01:11:05.490
TALIESIN: Matt's understanding that we are all
screwed.

01:11:05.490 --> 01:11:11.551
LIAM: Seven, eight, nine. It's hard to see over
there. 15 points of sneak attack damage. Yeah, I'm

01:11:11.551 --> 01:11:13.052
not used to the screen.

01:11:13.052 --> 01:11:18.649
MATT: We're working out the bugs. It's a process.
We're working on it. All right, cool. 15 points of

01:11:18.649 --> 01:11:23.776
sneak attack damage. So as you throw the two
daggers, plunging them both, both of them, their

01:11:23.776 --> 01:11:29.385
little aura of magical energy flashing as they
both impact the smoke form, seeming to sink slowly

01:11:29.385 --> 01:11:35.448
as they hit and then finding the edge of their
blades sunken into its torso. As it rears back.

01:11:35.448 --> 01:11:40.547
LIAM: Eight and eight and 15.

01:11:40.547 --> 01:11:41.648
MATT: Correct, all right.

01:11:41.648 --> 01:11:46.381
MARISHA: So the daggers did it.

01:11:46.381 --> 01:11:51.381
MATT: Cool. That, are you going to stay where you
are, Vax?

01:11:51.381 --> 01:11:53.234
LIAM: Yeah, I am.

01:11:53.234 --> 01:12:02.591
MATT: All right. Now it is the entity's turn. As
it rears and the daggers both vanish from its

01:12:02.591 --> 01:12:08.400
torso, returning to your belt side, it is glaring
down at you to its side, and it says, "Percival.

01:12:08.400 --> 01:12:15.120
"Don't make Orthax regret working with you."

01:12:15.120 --> 01:12:16.683
SAM: Orthax?

01:12:16.683 --> 01:12:18.128
MARISHA and TALIESIN: Orthax.

01:12:18.128 --> 01:12:21.645
SAM: I hired them to get rid of some termites in
my house, once.

01:12:21.645 --> 01:12:26.378
TALIESIN: Well that was really your mistake,
then.

01:12:26.378 --> 01:12:35.251
MATT: Shifting this way twice. Percy, you will get
an attack of opportunity with

01:12:35.251 --> 01:12:36.522
your rapier if you'd like.

01:12:36.522 --> 01:12:37.366
TALIESIN: I'll take it.

01:12:37.366 --> 01:12:38.400
MATT: All right.

01:12:38.400 --> 01:12:40.041
TRAVIS: You're using Briarwood's rapier?

01:12:40.041 --> 01:12:42.105
TALIESIN: No, I haven't. No short rest.

01:12:42.105 --> 01:12:42.987
TRAVIS: Right.

01:12:42.987 --> 01:12:48.119
TALIESIN: 25.

01:12:48.119 --> 01:12:50.153
MATT: 25 hits. Go ahead and roll damage.

01:12:50.153 --> 01:12:58.553
TALIESIN: Nine points.

01:12:58.553 --> 01:13:03.143
MATT: Nine points of damage. All right. Good to
know.

01:13:03.143 --> 01:13:04.916
TALIESIN: All right. Yeah.

01:13:04.916 --> 01:13:12.552
MATT: Now, on the rest of its turn. As it shifts
up, it doesn't walk or move, its form drifts along

01:13:12.552 --> 01:13:16.827
and the shadows meet it there, the smoke almost
appears at the spot where it intends to go and

01:13:16.827 --> 01:13:21.324
then it meets it in that moment. As it does, it
now stands between a bunch of you. Its eyes flare

01:13:21.324 --> 01:13:27.760
with dark purple, and you just hear this scream,
this screeching (scream) echo out from it, and as

01:13:27.760 --> 01:13:32.689
it does, all of you hold your ears for a second. I
need everyone to make a wisdom saving throw. You

01:13:32.689 --> 01:13:33.603
have advantage.

01:13:33.603 --> 01:13:35.835
LAURA: We have advantage?

01:13:35.835 --> 01:13:42.513
TALIESIN: 21.

01:13:42.513 --> 01:13:46.841
MARISHA: With the ten, 23.

01:13:46.841 --> 01:13:50.862
SAM: Natural 20. On the first roll.

01:13:50.862 --> 01:13:51.949
LIAM: 16.

01:13:51.949 --> 01:13:52.955
LAURA: 22.

01:13:52.955 --> 01:13:54.050
TRAVIS: 16.

01:13:54.050 --> 01:13:55.471
LAURA: 18 for Pike.

01:13:55.471 --> 01:14:05.878
MATT: Okay. So. All of you guys hold your ears for
a second, and everyone that rolled higher than a

01:14:05.878 --> 01:14:10.856
17 takes six points of psychic damage.

01:14:10.856 --> 01:14:12.953
MARISHA: Psychic damage?

01:14:12.953 --> 01:14:18.551
MATT: Correct. You guys both take 13 points of
psychic damage.

01:14:18.551 --> 01:14:21.351
TALIESIN: 13 because he's evil.

01:14:21.351 --> 01:14:31.332
MATT: Both of you feel all of a sudden like your
brain fill with this urge to strike something,

01:14:31.332 --> 01:14:42.018
this overwhelming need to slash out at whatever's
near you. Both of you get a brief move. Grog,

01:14:42.018 --> 01:14:47.838
that's going to pull you this way, and Vax, it's
going to pull you this way.

01:14:47.838 --> 01:14:48.891
LIAM: Right at each other.

01:14:48.891 --> 01:14:55.359
MATT: I need both of you guys to roll an attack
roll. As you rush up with your hammer, flames, and

01:14:55.359 --> 01:14:57.241
you swing it down towards Scanlan.

01:14:57.241 --> 01:14:58.871
LAURA: Scanlan!

01:14:58.871 --> 01:15:00.554
TRAVIS: Don't dap me for hitting Scanlan!

01:15:00.554 --> 01:15:04.869
SAM: I'm going to use Cutting Words to try to
dodge out of the way.

01:15:04.869 --> 01:15:06.055
MATT: Okay, roll the attack.

01:15:06.055 --> 01:15:11.348
TRAVIS: Oh shit. 19?

01:15:11.348 --> 01:15:13.211
MATT: Okay, so 19.

01:15:13.211 --> 01:15:18.455
SAM: I'm going to say, you gonna fail that
attack, so you better sit your ass on back,

01:15:18.482 --> 01:15:22.827
because I ain't no hollaback gnome, I ain't no
hollaback gnome.

01:15:22.827 --> 01:15:24.449
MATT: All right, roll a d10.

01:15:24.449 --> 01:15:31.896
SAM: d10. Three? So that, what does that do?

01:15:31.896 --> 01:15:33.868
MATT: All right, so Cutting Words, if I recall--

01:15:33.868 --> 01:15:36.030
SAM: It lowers his attack by three.

01:15:36.030 --> 01:15:38.257
MATT: Right, so that brings it from 19 to 16.
What's your armor class?

01:15:38.257 --> 01:15:40.174
SAM: It's 17.

01:15:40.174 --> 01:15:46.855
MATT: With that, the bard's words ring true to
your mind, and for a second, you feel this new,

01:15:46.855 --> 01:15:51.541
this not Grog-based rage, this outside forceful
rage that it confuses you, and as he says that,

01:15:51.541 --> 01:15:53.985
you're right! He is no hollaback gnome.

01:15:53.985 --> 01:15:56.126
(laughter)

01:15:56.126 --> 01:16:00.024
MATT: And you resist with the hammer, giving him
just enough time to step out of the way, and it

01:16:00.024 --> 01:16:03.209
slams into the ground harmlessly, cracking the
stone at the base.

01:16:03.209 --> 01:16:05.872
TRAVIS: "You know what? You're right! He is no
hollaback gnome."

01:16:05.872 --> 01:16:11.378
MATT: Vax, I'd like you to go ahead and make a
dagger strike against Pike.

01:16:11.378 --> 01:16:13.194
LIAM: I rolled a 13.

01:16:13.194 --> 01:16:17.877
MATT: Rolled a 13. Pike, you look over your
shoulder as all of a sudden Vax appears behind you

01:16:17.877 --> 01:16:23.898
and slams forward with the dagger. You whip around
with your shield and, with a large striking arc of

01:16:23.898 --> 01:16:29.776
sparks deflect the blade blow across the dark air
of this interior tunnel, harmlessly. You take no

01:16:29.776 --> 01:16:30.920
damage.

01:16:30.920 --> 01:16:32.727
LAURA: Badass Pike!

01:16:32.727 --> 01:16:34.617
TALIESIN: She also ain't no hollaback gnome.

01:16:34.617 --> 01:16:36.267
MARISHA: Ain't no hollaback gnome.

01:16:36.267 --> 01:16:37.552
TALIESIN: Ain't no hollaback gnome.

01:16:37.552 --> 01:16:39.504
ASHLEY: Ain't no hollaback gnome!

01:16:39.504 --> 01:16:50.051
MATT: And with that, you know what? It's going to
go ahead and do this. The entity then moves

01:16:50.051 --> 01:16:54.758
backwards. Pike and Scanlan-- oh, you already used
your reaction to do Cutting Words, so you don't

01:16:54.758 --> 01:16:57.268
get that. Pike, go ahead and make a melee attack.

01:16:57.268 --> 01:17:00.452
SAM: Damn it. That's a reaction?

01:17:00.452 --> 01:17:02.641
ASHLEY: What do I roll for that, again?

01:17:02.641 --> 01:17:03.916
MATT: One reaction per round.

01:17:03.916 --> 01:17:05.151
LAURA: Your d20.

01:17:05.151 --> 01:17:06.997
MATT: Just roll a d20, roll for your normal mace
attack.

01:17:06.997 --> 01:17:09.101
ASHLEY: 17?

01:17:09.101 --> 01:17:13.994
MATT: 17, unfortunately, does not hit. It seems
like it should've, but the smoke is obscuring the

01:17:13.994 --> 01:17:17.663
vision around it, and where you swing, you do not
manage to get quite close enough to hit its body.

01:17:17.663 --> 01:17:21.162
As it steps backward into the wall and out of
visual range.

01:17:21.162 --> 01:17:22.044
MARISHA: What!

01:17:22.044 --> 01:17:23.526
LAURA: What?

01:17:23.526 --> 01:17:24.852
SAM: Into the wall?

01:17:24.852 --> 01:17:31.145
MATT: Into the wall. It just vanishes into the
side of the tunnel. That brings us to Grog.

01:17:31.145 --> 01:17:32.798
LIAM: The cloud went in the wall?

01:17:32.798 --> 01:17:33.952
MATT: Yeah.

01:17:33.952 --> 01:17:36.065
TRAVIS: I would like to rage.

01:17:36.065 --> 01:17:37.232
MATT: Okay.

01:17:37.232 --> 01:17:44.240
TRAVIS: And move in front of the rest of the
group. I put my back to the rest of the group.

01:17:44.240 --> 01:17:46.028
MATT: Okay, so like right there?

01:17:46.028 --> 01:17:46.917
TRAVIS: Yeah.

01:17:46.917 --> 01:17:47.674
MATT: Okay.

01:17:47.674 --> 01:17:50.019
SAM: What the fuck, Grog, you just tried to kill
me!

01:17:50.019 --> 01:17:51.012
TRAVIS: I did?

01:17:51.012 --> 01:17:52.042
SAM: Yes!

01:17:52.042 --> 01:17:53.215
TRAVIS: I don't remember that.

01:17:53.215 --> 01:17:54.086
SAM: Are you okay?

01:17:54.086 --> 01:17:54.969
TRAVIS: Yeah!

01:17:54.969 --> 01:17:57.348
MATT: If you want to, you can hold. You can use
your action to ready an attack so whenever a

01:17:57.348 --> 01:18:00.512
trigger of your choosing happens, you can then
make your attack.

01:18:00.512 --> 01:18:01.704
TRAVIS: I would like to do that.

01:18:01.704 --> 01:18:03.275
MATT: Okay. What trigger would you like?

01:18:03.275 --> 01:18:05.784
TRAVIS: When he reappears.

01:18:05.784 --> 01:18:07.586
MATT: Okay, and comes within melee range?

01:18:07.586 --> 01:18:09.987
TRAVIS: Yeah, when I can see him with my beautiful
eyes.

01:18:09.987 --> 01:18:13.892
MATT: Okay, so you're holding your action there.
Good to know. Keyleth, you're up.

01:18:13.892 --> 01:18:24.226
MARISHA: Okay. Not trusting this guy, I'm going to
go ahead and cast Faerie Fire. It's a 20-foot

01:18:24.226 --> 01:18:27.309
radius. Just right in this bubble that we've been
hanging out in.

01:18:27.309 --> 01:18:28.428
MATT: Okay.

01:18:28.428 --> 01:18:30.707
MARISHA: Because I'm assuming he's going to be up
in our faces.

01:18:30.707 --> 01:18:37.638
MATT: All righty. Faerie Fire. Where do you want
it? Just in this vicinity?

01:18:37.638 --> 01:18:40.034
MARISHA: Yeah, just right, right around us.

01:18:40.034 --> 01:18:44.622
MATT: Okay, so, 20-foot radius so we'll say
probably in the back here and forward this way, so

01:18:44.622 --> 01:18:53.901
this area between these. So as Keyleth, you put
your arms up and this burst of glowing luminescent

01:18:53.901 --> 01:19:01.013
pinkish-purple energy begins to sparkle through
the air like glitter suspended in low gravity, and

01:19:01.013 --> 01:19:04.845
it drifts through the air in the entire vicinity,
you can see it clinging to you guys a little bit.

01:19:04.845 --> 01:19:08.621
All right. Are you going to move or you going to
stay where you are?

01:19:08.621 --> 01:19:10.215
MARISHA: I'll step back a bit.

01:19:10.215 --> 01:19:12.319
MATT: Step out of the Faerie Fire or into it?

01:19:12.319 --> 01:19:13.439
MARISHA: Step out of it.

01:19:13.439 --> 01:19:14.645
MATT: Okay. Am I?

01:19:14.645 --> 01:19:15.901
MARISHA: That's good.

01:19:15.901 --> 01:19:19.156
MATT: Just ten feet? Okay. Ending your turn,
Keyleth. Pike, you're up.

01:19:19.156 --> 01:19:24.718
ASHLEY: Okay. Is Guiding Bolt considered the same
thing that Lightning Bolt would be?

01:19:24.718 --> 01:19:28.251
MATT: No, as far as you know--

01:19:28.251 --> 01:19:29.654
LIAM: Radiant damage.

01:19:29.654 --> 01:19:34.927
MATT: Yeah, it's radiant damage and, let me pull
up the--

01:19:34.927 --> 01:19:36.669
TRAVIS: We can't see him right now, though.

01:19:36.669 --> 01:19:42.696
MATT: Yeah, you have no visual on him. The smoke
entity has moved into the wall and is nowhere in

01:19:42.696 --> 01:19:46.982
your visible range right now, so you have nothing
that you can attack in theory that you know of.

01:19:46.982 --> 01:19:49.580
ASHLEY: Okay.

01:19:49.580 --> 01:19:56.546
MATT: If you have any buff spells, anything you
want to do in preparation for it, or hold your

01:19:56.546 --> 01:19:58.660
action as well until it reappears, you can do
that.

01:19:58.660 --> 01:20:00.148
ASHLEY: Okay, I'll hold my action.

01:20:00.148 --> 01:20:01.158
MATT: Okay.

01:20:01.158 --> 01:20:02.110
ASHLEY: Yeah.

01:20:02.110 --> 01:20:04.949
MATT: Are you staying put? Are you moving at all,
or do you want to stay where you are?

01:20:04.949 --> 01:20:09.249
ASHLEY: I think I'll stay. I can't see where I'm
at, but I think I'll just stay.

01:20:09.249 --> 01:20:10.330
MATT: Okay. Cool.

01:20:10.330 --> 01:20:15.619
SAM: I'm going to just call out to everybody, the
thing seems to want Percy.

01:20:15.718 --> 01:20:18.131
Should we surround him?

01:20:18.131 --> 01:20:19.339
LIAM: Yes.

01:20:19.339 --> 01:20:26.734
MATT: So you shout that out at the end of that?
Cassandra, now, who has been unbound, gets up. Her

01:20:26.734 --> 01:20:31.579
weapons were taken from her when you bound her, so
she stands up and puts herself to the wall and

01:20:31.579 --> 01:20:33.282
looks at you with a--

01:20:33.282 --> 01:20:34.512
TALIESIN: I hand her my sword.

01:20:34.512 --> 01:20:42.000
MATT: Okay. She takes the rapier and looks at it
and goes running away, back towards where Castle

01:20:42.000 --> 01:20:43.379
Whitestone is.

01:20:43.379 --> 01:20:44.608
TALIESIN: Yeah.

01:20:44.608 --> 01:20:46.145
TRAVIS: She runs?

01:20:46.145 --> 01:20:50.459
ASHLEY: Can I do something?

01:20:50.459 --> 01:20:56.561
MATT: If you want to, instead of holding your
action, cast something, you can do that.

01:20:56.561 --> 01:21:03.975
ASHLEY: Yeah, I'm going to go up to Percy and cast
Protection from Evil on him.

01:21:03.975 --> 01:21:06.045
TALIESIN: Whoa!

01:21:06.045 --> 01:21:07.871
ASHLEY: Which...

01:21:07.871 --> 01:21:15.310
MATT: What are you going to choose? You get to
choose a certain type of creature which he's

01:21:15.310 --> 01:21:16.978
protected against.

01:21:16.978 --> 01:21:18.964
TALIESIN: Do we know anything about Orthax?

01:21:18.964 --> 01:21:27.020
MATT: You have no idea. You saw it briefly. I'm
going to have you roll a religion check. Being a

01:21:27.020 --> 01:21:33.851
religiously trained individual, let's see if you
can ascertain the nature of this creature, this

01:21:33.851 --> 01:21:35.706
entity.

01:21:35.706 --> 01:21:39.430
ASHLEY: 22.

01:21:39.430 --> 01:21:45.527
MATT: 22? Okay. In the brief moment you got to see
it, the way it moves, the way it completely cast

01:21:45.527 --> 01:21:50.280
aside Scanlan's attack, and the way that it housed
itself within Percy for so long. There are

01:21:50.280 --> 01:21:55.451
elements of it that make you think of a shadow
demon. But usually, they're not this large.

01:21:55.451 --> 01:22:02.287
They're not this powerful. Either this is just a
powerful entity of a similar type, or it's been

01:22:02.287 --> 01:22:07.687
feeding over time, or it's something beyond that,
but you get the sense that this thing is demonic

01:22:07.687 --> 01:22:10.717
in nature, based on the brief appearance you had
with it.

01:22:10.717 --> 01:22:13.470
ASHLEY: Okay, I'd like to protect him from shadow
demons.

01:22:13.470 --> 01:22:18.153
MATT: Okay, so that would be fiends. So you choose
fiends? Great. So any attack rolls against you

01:22:18.153 --> 01:22:21.394
from fiend creatures have disadvantage.

01:22:21.394 --> 01:22:22.504
LAURA: He's a demon?

01:22:22.504 --> 01:22:25.105
MATT: She's thinking he might be, based on her
roll.

01:22:25.105 --> 01:22:28.911
LAURA: I have favored enemy as demons.

01:22:28.911 --> 01:22:40.871
MATT: Then, knowing that going forward, that may
change your next round of combat. Good to know! So

01:22:40.871 --> 01:22:43.679
you are currently are protected from fiends.

01:22:43.679 --> 01:22:46.395
TALIESIN: If only that were true in real life.

01:22:46.395 --> 01:22:48.111
MATT: Vex, you're up first.

01:22:48.111 --> 01:22:53.284
LAURA: Oh. So demons are my favored enemy, so I
have advantage against recalling information about

01:22:53.284 --> 01:22:56.620
them. Can I recall anything about something that
looks like this?

01:22:56.620 --> 01:22:57.955
MARISHA: Orthax?

01:22:57.955 --> 01:23:02.760
MATT: Make an intelligence check. Just roll a d20
and add your intelligence. And you have advantage

01:23:02.760 --> 01:23:04.962
on it because he's your favored.

01:23:04.962 --> 01:23:08.432
LAURA: I'm not that smart. 12.

01:23:08.432 --> 01:23:18.250
MATT: 12? Okay. You know that these creatures are
incorporeal. They can generally shift in and out

01:23:18.250 --> 01:23:23.816
of solid matter as a way of moving and defending
itself. You know that they're difficult to fight

01:23:23.816 --> 01:23:29.951
in the dark. You also know that they, because of
their form, are generally resistant to a lot of

01:23:29.951 --> 01:23:36.678
types of elemental-type damage. And lighting and
cold: no effect whatsoever.

01:23:36.678 --> 01:23:38.020
LAURA: Got it.

01:23:38.020 --> 01:23:39.356
MATT: As well as poison.

01:23:39.356 --> 01:23:40.658
LAURA: Good to know.

01:23:40.658 --> 01:23:42.699
MATT: That's as much as you can ascertain with
that roll.

01:23:42.699 --> 01:23:51.747
LAURA: Okay. All right, then I'm going to cast--
where is he? (shouting) He's in the fucking wall!

01:23:51.747 --> 01:23:53.369
SAM: Just hit the whole wall.

01:23:53.369 --> 01:23:55.955
LAURA: Hunter's Mark. Can I sense anything about
where he is?

01:23:55.955 --> 01:23:59.402
MATT: Yeah, you can actually sense him. He's maybe
ten feet inside the wall.

01:23:59.402 --> 01:24:00.792
LAURA: So he's hiding?

01:24:00.792 --> 01:24:02.436
MATT: He's currently hiding in the wall, yeah.

01:24:02.436 --> 01:24:07.280
LAURA: All right, then for my bonus action, I'm
going to hide, as well.

01:24:07.280 --> 01:24:11.192
MATT: Okay. Go ahead and roll a stealth check.

01:24:11.192 --> 01:24:12.335
LIAM: Advantage.

01:24:12.335 --> 01:24:13.320
MATT: Yeah.

01:24:13.320 --> 01:24:16.563
LAURA: Really?!

01:24:16.563 --> 01:24:20.808
LIAM: I didn't roll it. The cape had nothing to do
with your rolls.

01:24:20.808 --> 01:24:22.931
MATT: What?

01:24:22.931 --> 01:24:24.122
LIAM: Three and a three.

01:24:24.122 --> 01:24:26.012
LAURA: Well, hold on, let me add my stealth to
it.

01:24:26.012 --> 01:24:27.004
SAM: That's a 33.

01:24:27.004 --> 01:24:28.192
LAURA: That's a 12.

01:24:28.192 --> 01:24:32.451
MATT: Okay, good to know. So you (wind noise)
flatten yourself against the wall, best of your

01:24:32.451 --> 01:24:33.250
ability.

01:24:33.250 --> 01:24:35.152
LAURA: I do pretty much nothing. And I'm going to
hold my turn until he appears.

01:24:35.152 --> 01:24:37.522
MATT: Okay, so you're going to hold your action
until he appears.

01:24:37.522 --> 01:24:38.795
MARISHA: How dark is it in here?

01:24:38.795 --> 01:24:41.254
MATT: Other than the torches you guys have been
carrying through here?

01:24:41.254 --> 01:24:43.153
SAM: And the glowing off of our bodies.

01:24:43.153 --> 01:24:44.243
MATT: Yes.

01:24:44.243 --> 01:24:46.995
LAURA: Oh, right. I'm glowing. No wonder I rolled
so poorly.

01:24:46.995 --> 01:24:54.722
MATT: Glowing from the Faerie Fire. But it's a
gentle glow, so it's very low light in this area.

01:24:54.722 --> 01:24:56.589
TALIESIN: Like inside of Groot gentle glow.

01:24:56.589 --> 01:24:57.766
MARISHA: It's like we have body glitter on.

01:24:57.766 --> 01:24:58.864
LAURA: It's beautiful.

01:24:58.864 --> 01:25:01.794
MATT: Yeah. It's like a nice basement bar. A good
dive.

01:25:01.794 --> 01:25:03.473
SAM: Get this shit off me!

01:25:03.473 --> 01:25:06.689
MATT: (laughs) Ending your turn. Scanlan, you're
up.

01:25:06.689 --> 01:25:15.877
SAM: I say to Keyleth, get this shit off me. I
don't want it to see me. Please. And then I will

01:25:15.877 --> 01:25:21.239
walk to the other side of Percy. We don't see the
thing, right?

01:25:21.239 --> 01:25:22.384
MATT: No.

01:25:22.384 --> 01:25:24.923
MARISHA: You can just move out of the Faerie Fire.
It's only a 20-foot radius.

01:25:24.923 --> 01:25:26.352
SAM: No, but isn't it on me now?

01:25:26.352 --> 01:25:30.875
MARISHA: No, it's a radius. If you move out of it,
you're not in it.

01:25:30.875 --> 01:25:31.912
SAM: I walk out of it.

01:25:31.912 --> 01:25:35.833
MATT: All right. You step out of the area and it
all drifts off your body, and you're no longer

01:25:35.833 --> 01:25:36.924
affected by the spell.

01:25:36.924 --> 01:25:48.003
SAM: We don't see the thing, right? Yeah. There's
not much we can do without

01:25:48.003 --> 01:25:49.420
seeing our enemy, right?

01:25:49.420 --> 01:25:51.047
MATT: Not currently, no.

01:25:51.047 --> 01:25:54.824
SAM: I'll just hold my turn? Is that a thing? Can
I do that?

01:25:54.824 --> 01:25:56.513
MATT: Yeah, you can do that.

01:25:56.513 --> 01:26:01.193
SAM: I can say to Grog, Grog? You're sure you
want to-- are you okay? You're good?

01:26:01.193 --> 01:26:02.225
TRAVIS: Yeah.

01:26:02.225 --> 01:26:03.395
SAM: All right.

01:26:03.395 --> 01:26:06.530
MATT: All right. Ends your turn. Percy, you're
up.

01:26:06.530 --> 01:26:08.232
TALIESIN: I'm going to back out of the Faerie
Fire.

01:26:08.232 --> 01:26:11.715
MATT: You're just stepping out of it there. You
can keep going if you want.

01:26:11.715 --> 01:26:16.895
TALIESIN: I'm going to go a little further back
behind Scanlan. And I'm going to pull out Bad News

01:26:16.895 --> 01:26:18.557
and hold my turn.

01:26:18.557 --> 01:26:23.830
MATT: Okay. Ending your turn. Vax, you're up.

01:26:23.830 --> 01:26:28.349
LIAM: Yeah, I'm going to practice an old trick
that my sister and I have done, where I hide

01:26:28.349 --> 01:26:35.395
behind Trinket's gigantic bear ass and hold my
turn and aim at the spot that

01:26:35.395 --> 01:26:36.755
my sister is aiming at.

01:26:36.755 --> 01:26:38.335
MATT: All right, good to know.

01:26:38.335 --> 01:26:39.382
TALIESIN: Ditto.

01:26:39.382 --> 01:26:49.787
MATT: All right. At that moment, as you vanish to
the side, the entity pops out from this side--

01:26:49.787 --> 01:26:53.236
LAURA: Right behind him?

01:26:53.236 --> 01:26:57.042
MATT: Right behind you as you're preparing. And
all of a sudden (whoosh) smoke billows out. You

01:26:57.042 --> 01:26:59.703
turn out of the corner of your head. At that
point, everyone who was holding your action,

01:26:59.703 --> 01:27:02.074
you're doing your attacks simultaneously.

01:27:02.074 --> 01:27:03.044
LAURA: Whoa.

01:27:03.044 --> 01:27:05.332
MARISHA: And he's in that Faerie Fire, right?

01:27:05.332 --> 01:27:06.947
MATT: He is, currently, yeah.

01:27:06.947 --> 01:27:08.395
MARISHA: So you get advantage, yo.

01:27:08.395 --> 01:27:11.577
MATT: He didn't see it being cast. He withdrew
before it happened, so he steps right into it.

01:27:11.577 --> 01:27:15.667
TALIESIN: All right, starting with Bad News with a
sharpshooter.

01:27:15.667 --> 01:27:19.127
LAURA: We get advantage on attacking him?

01:27:19.127 --> 01:27:21.161
MATT: Yeah, all of your attacks on him currently
have advantage.

01:27:21.161 --> 01:27:29.616
TALIESIN: Thank god, because I rolled a one. 14?

01:27:29.616 --> 01:27:34.487
MATT: 14 unfortunately misses. You fire and
(ricochet noise) it seems that, in a strange way,

01:27:34.487 --> 01:27:38.355
the gentle pink dust is actually obscuring your
vision with the dark shadow in that vicinity and

01:27:38.355 --> 01:27:40.635
it blasts a piece of rock off the side of the
wall.

01:27:40.635 --> 01:27:42.105
TALIESIN: Firing again.

01:27:42.105 --> 01:27:43.281
MATT: So fire, reload.

01:27:43.281 --> 01:27:49.065
TALIESIN: Better! 26.

01:27:49.065 --> 01:27:52.242
MATT: 26 does hit. Go ahead and roll damage.

01:27:52.242 --> 01:28:14.988
TALIESIN: That's... That's pizza! I'm looking for
my dice. I didn't think this through. 25 points of

01:28:14.988 --> 01:28:16.095
damage.

01:28:16.095 --> 01:28:20.828
MATT: All right, good to know. This is piercing,
right?

01:28:20.828 --> 01:28:21.876
TALIESIN: Yeah.

01:28:21.876 --> 01:28:29.016
MATT: All right. The blast hits, but it appears
that the expected impact from the blast of Bad

01:28:29.016 --> 01:28:35.791
News-- a bit of smoke dissipates its impact and it
seems to not be as damaging as you expected it to

01:28:35.791 --> 01:28:40.828
be. All right, that brings us to the next person
who was holding their action. I believe Scanlan,

01:28:40.828 --> 01:28:43.462
you were? What do you want to do?

01:28:43.462 --> 01:28:53.219
SAM: There's precious little I can do, so I will
viciously mock it.

01:28:53.219 --> 01:28:55.440
(laughter)

01:28:55.440 --> 01:28:56.556
MATT: Good.

01:28:56.556 --> 01:29:03.705
SAM: Through the Hand Cone, I will say, don't you
know smoking is the number one cause of cancer and

01:29:03.705 --> 01:29:11.284
emphysema and will shorten your life by an
estimated ten to 20 years? It's not cool, and you

01:29:11.284 --> 01:29:12.836
shouldn't do it.

01:29:12.836 --> 01:29:14.247
TALIESIN: Is that all true?

01:29:14.247 --> 01:29:15.546
SAM: I'm BS-ing!

01:29:15.546 --> 01:29:16.627
TALIESIN: Oh, okay.

01:29:16.627 --> 01:29:24.856
MATT: Okay. It does not make its saving throw; it
rolled a four, so it takes 3d4 psychic damage. Go

01:29:24.856 --> 01:29:28.684
ahead and roll that. And it has disadvantage on
its next attack roll.

01:29:28.684 --> 01:29:31.121
LIAM: That fiend has low self-esteem.

01:29:31.121 --> 01:29:32.712
SAM: Five points.

01:29:32.712 --> 01:29:35.317
MATT: Five points of damage, boom.

01:29:35.317 --> 01:29:36.762
SAM: And it has disadvantage on what?

01:29:36.762 --> 01:29:43.188
MATT: On its next attack roll. Its eyes go darker
purple for a second, like it can't contemplate the

01:29:43.188 --> 01:29:49.815
fact that it just got insulted mid-battle, and
then they flare up again, even more furious. As

01:29:49.815 --> 01:29:51.302
part of that, it's going to use its reaction.

01:29:51.302 --> 01:29:53.164
SAM: Oh shit. Okay.

01:29:53.164 --> 01:29:57.810
MATT: It turns towards you and in-- what languages
do you speak?

01:29:57.810 --> 01:30:00.944
SAM: Gnome, Common. That's it.

01:30:00.944 --> 01:30:02.827
(laughter)

01:30:02.827 --> 01:30:08.755
MATT: You hear a muttering through your ears.
(mutters in foreign language) And for a second,

01:30:08.804 --> 01:30:12.586
you feel your field of vision close down like it's
focused entirely on you. You're currently marked

01:30:12.586 --> 01:30:15.079
by its Mark of Vengeance.

01:30:15.079 --> 01:30:16.784
SAM: Marked?

01:30:16.784 --> 01:30:21.871
MATT: Yeah. So, essentially, there's an effect
that's intent on you at the moment.

01:30:21.871 --> 01:30:23.318
SAM: Is it a charm effect?

01:30:23.318 --> 01:30:24.138
MATT: Nope.

01:30:24.138 --> 01:30:25.131
SAM: Damn it.

01:30:25.131 --> 01:30:27.458
MATT: All right, that ends your held actions.

01:30:27.458 --> 01:30:28.478
SAM: Is it a fear effect?

01:30:28.478 --> 01:30:29.309
MATT: No.

01:30:29.309 --> 01:30:30.170
SAM: Damn it!

01:30:30.170 --> 01:30:30.953
MATT: You're up.

01:30:30.953 --> 01:30:33.454
LIAM: Yeah, I just saw him mutter in Scanlan's ear
as I take both of my blades and I'm just going to

01:30:33.454 --> 01:30:37.880
slash both of them across and he's surrounded, so
this is a sneak attack, as well.

01:30:37.880 --> 01:30:38.745
MATT: Yes.

01:30:38.745 --> 01:30:40.846
LIAM: With advantage. The first one...

01:30:40.846 --> 01:30:42.694
LIAM and LAURA: (groan)

01:30:42.694 --> 01:30:47.990
LIAM: Is 16. Oh no! And the second one is a 27.

01:30:47.990 --> 01:30:49.280
MATT: Second one hits.

01:30:49.280 --> 01:30:50.408
LIAM: All right.

01:30:50.408 --> 01:30:54.266
MATT: You go to strike the first time, and as you
swing outward, you catch smoke and it dissipates

01:30:54.266 --> 01:30:56.972
around the blade and you stab into the side of the
wall.

01:30:56.972 --> 01:30:57.939
LIAM: Okay.

01:30:57.939 --> 01:30:59.263
MATT: Second attack (impact noise).

01:30:59.263 --> 01:31:05.311
LIAM: Here comes that sneak attack damage. That's
four plus six is ten plus... sneak attack,

01:31:05.311 --> 01:31:11.908
motherfucker! Ten, 16, 21, 22, 26, 28, 29 total.

01:31:11.908 --> 01:31:13.096
LAURA: That was 38.

01:31:13.096 --> 01:31:14.213
LIAM: Huh?

01:31:14.213 --> 01:31:15.352
LAURA: Just kidding.

01:31:15.352 --> 01:31:16.726
LIAM and LAURA: 29 total.

01:31:16.726 --> 01:31:18.502
LAURA: (singing) My math is awesome!

01:31:18.502 --> 01:31:24.572
MATT: Okay. This blade, however: as you stab into
this cloud of smoke, you feel there is more

01:31:24.572 --> 01:31:31.382
physical presence to where it was and it sinks in
and you feel this reverberation as it reacts to

01:31:31.382 --> 01:31:34.902
the pain. This dull (hoarse growl) growl sound.

01:31:34.902 --> 01:31:37.325
LIAM: I shout, hands off the gnome! as I do it.

01:31:37.325 --> 01:31:38.483
MATT: Okay.

01:31:38.483 --> 01:31:41.125
SAM: On my roll, do I still get a bonus?

01:31:41.125 --> 01:31:47.161
MATT: You used it last turn. That was his reaction
to you holding your action.

01:31:47.161 --> 01:31:50.642
SAM: No, but do I get my bonus action as part of
my move, or no?

01:31:50.642 --> 01:31:54.409
MATT: That would have had to be during your turn.
When you hold your action, you just get the action

01:31:54.409 --> 01:31:55.415
when it triggers.

01:31:55.415 --> 01:31:56.447
SAM: Got it.

01:31:56.447 --> 01:32:00.760
MATT: All right, so that ends Vax. Do you want to
do anything else?

01:32:00.760 --> 01:32:14.857
LIAM: No. Oh, I'm right up against it? I'm going
to use disengage and back up further back by my

01:32:14.857 --> 01:32:17.630
sister. Is that Vex and Keyleth?

01:32:17.630 --> 01:32:18.732
MATT: Right there, yeah.

01:32:18.732 --> 01:32:20.339
LIAM: I'm going to move between my two favorite
ladies.

01:32:20.339 --> 01:32:25.860
MATT: All right, there you go. Good to know. And
you were holding your action?

01:32:25.860 --> 01:32:26.996
LAURA: Yes.

01:32:26.996 --> 01:32:28.118
MATT: And you were holding your action.

01:32:28.118 --> 01:32:28.877
TRAVIS: Yeah.

01:32:28.877 --> 01:32:30.005
MATT: So everyone make your attacks.

01:32:30.005 --> 01:32:32.030
LAURA: Yes. Here's my question.

01:32:32.030 --> 01:32:32.979
MATT: Yes?

01:32:32.979 --> 01:32:39.393
LAURA: Because I want to be honest and I don't
remember if I said I dipped arrows in the second

01:32:39.393 --> 01:32:43.330
holy oil flask or if I put them on Trinket's
claws. Do we remember?

01:32:43.330 --> 01:32:44.720
MATT: You did all arrows.

01:32:44.720 --> 01:32:48.276
LAURA: That's fine. Then I'm going to shoot two
more holy arrows at him.

01:32:48.276 --> 01:32:52.265
Okay, well, I'll roll for that.

01:32:52.265 --> 01:32:55.055
MARISHA: With advantage!

01:32:55.055 --> 01:33:04.443
LAURA: With advantage, which is good. I'm going to
switch things. New ones. (gasps) What just

01:33:04.443 --> 01:33:05.414
happened?

01:33:05.414 --> 01:33:10.409
LIAM: Well, one of those was a 14, so that hit.
There's 14 and eight. 14 plus your attack. The

01:33:10.409 --> 01:33:12.143
second roll, she got a one and a two, so.

01:33:12.143 --> 01:33:19.629
LAURA: Seriously?! So one was a 25. And then 17.

01:33:19.629 --> 01:33:20.906
MATT: 17 misses, unfortunately.

01:33:20.906 --> 01:33:22.657
LAURA: I mean 19. 19 and a 25.

01:33:22.657 --> 01:33:24.821
MATT: What's the 19 from?

01:33:24.821 --> 01:33:27.297
LAURA: Was the first roll. And the second--

01:33:27.297 --> 01:33:28.756
MATT: Right, so you rolled a one and a two?

01:33:28.756 --> 01:33:31.608
LIAM: No, that was the second roll. The first was
an eight and a 14, plus her modifiers.

01:33:31.608 --> 01:33:36.973
LAURA: Oh. See, I was rolling-- I understand. I
was rolling it in my head differently, but we'll

01:33:36.973 --> 01:33:42.087
count it as that. I was counting it as that was my
first attempts at my first two attacks and my

01:33:42.087 --> 01:33:43.975
second attempts at my first two attacks.

01:33:43.975 --> 01:33:45.120
MATT: Yeah, it doesn't work that way.

01:33:45.120 --> 01:33:47.213
LAURA: Yeah, okay, that's fine. So, 25.

01:33:47.213 --> 01:33:50.182
MATT: Okay, so one of them hit. All right, so you
go ahead and roll damage on that.

01:33:50.182 --> 01:33:59.801
LAURA: I won't roll like that anymore. Where am I?
That's radiant damage and that's that. Here we go.

01:33:59.801 --> 01:34:01.044
All right.

01:34:01.044 --> 01:34:06.130
LIAM: Oh jeez, we've got a smoke demon, don'tcha
know?

01:34:06.130 --> 01:34:11.511
LAURA: 17 plus five is--

01:34:11.511 --> 01:34:12.346
LIAM: 24.

01:34:12.346 --> 01:34:13.316
LAURA: 24 points.

01:34:13.316 --> 01:34:17.933
MATT: 24 points of damage. So one of them flies
forward and misses--

01:34:17.933 --> 01:34:18.971
LAURA: 22.

01:34:18.971 --> 01:34:23.271
MATT: Yeah. Nearly grazes the top of your head,
just vanishing. You don't notice because you're

01:34:23.271 --> 01:34:28.073
currently (growls) right in his face. Second one
manages to strike it and splinter inside of its

01:34:28.073 --> 01:34:34.806
torso, and you can see a flash of energy from the
impact and it (squawking groan, growl) surveys the

01:34:34.806 --> 01:34:38.457
area around it. The smoke around it gets even more
intense, and you can see it flaring up.

01:34:38.457 --> 01:34:40.134
LAURA: I'm still against the wall, glowing.

01:34:40.134 --> 01:34:43.403
MATT: Yeah, so the smoke gets even thicker and
obscures it even further.

01:34:43.403 --> 01:34:50.895
LAURA: We should probably light up this area as
much as possible, FYI.

01:34:50.895 --> 01:34:52.251
MATT: And Grog?

01:34:52.251 --> 01:34:56.609
TRAVIS: I'm going to light it up with my flaming
war hammer. I turn and I swing at it.

01:34:56.609 --> 01:34:57.435
MATT: Okay.

01:34:57.435 --> 01:35:00.252
MARISHA: So metal.

01:35:00.252 --> 01:35:04.589
TRAVIS: Hey, that's good. 28?

01:35:04.589 --> 01:35:07.147
MATT: 28 hits. Second attack.

01:35:07.147 --> 01:35:08.955
TRAVIS: 26.

01:35:08.955 --> 01:35:10.512
MATT: 26 hits.

01:35:10.512 --> 01:35:13.315
TRAVIS: Nice. Oh, is it still covered in the holy
oil?

01:35:13.315 --> 01:35:17.527
MATT: Yes, so an extra 1d4 radiant damage on each
strike.

01:35:17.527 --> 01:35:24.393
TRAVIS: 21 for the first one.

01:35:24.393 --> 01:35:25.587
MATT: Okay.

01:35:25.587 --> 01:35:28.078
TRAVIS: With the radiant, fiery damage.

01:35:28.078 --> 01:35:31.884
MATT: Burning, holy wrath.

01:35:31.884 --> 01:35:35.891
TRAVIS: Fuck yes! 19, 20, 21. 22!

01:35:35.891 --> 01:35:42.995
MATT: 22. All righty. (impact sounds) Both hammer
blows strike it, battering the smoke around, and

01:35:42.995 --> 01:35:47.980
you can see as this hammer swings through its
body, the smoke almost swallows the light and for

01:35:47.980 --> 01:35:53.652
a second, it's almost like this dull orb of
darkness beneath the surface of a deep lake. And

01:35:53.699 --> 01:35:56.616
then as the hammer emerges from its body, the
light flares up again. It's almost like it's

01:35:56.616 --> 01:36:02.130
swallowing the light as you strike it. But it
seems to be taking the impacts pretty hard. All

01:36:02.130 --> 01:36:06.214
right, that ends your turn. Now, Orthax can take
his turn.

01:36:06.214 --> 01:36:07.068
LAURA: Oh no.

01:36:07.068 --> 01:36:09.511
MATT: All right, so let's see.

01:36:09.511 --> 01:36:10.996
ASHLEY: Wait, do I get my--

01:36:10.996 --> 01:36:14.301
MATT: That's right, you were holding, too. Yeah,
you can do it, too. Thank you for reminding me.

01:36:14.301 --> 01:36:15.443
LAURA: Yay, Pike!

01:36:15.443 --> 01:36:17.683
ASHLEY: Okay, I'm going to Guiding Bolt it.

01:36:17.683 --> 01:36:18.855
MATT: All right, go for it.

01:36:18.855 --> 01:36:22.036
LIAM: Your punishment will be more severe.

01:36:22.036 --> 01:36:24.570
(laughter)

01:36:24.570 --> 01:36:27.217
ASHLEY: All right, so 4d6--

01:36:27.217 --> 01:36:29.970
MATT: What level of Guiding Bolt are you doing?

01:36:29.970 --> 01:36:32.020
ASHLEY: Say one more time?

01:36:32.020 --> 01:36:33.778
MATT: What level of Guiding Bolt are you casting?

01:36:33.778 --> 01:36:40.322
ASHLEY: I'm going to do it at 4th because I have a
couple of 4th-level left.

01:36:40.322 --> 01:36:47.540
MATT: Okay, so that will be... (chuckles) Roll to
attack first. You have advantage on the attack

01:36:47.540 --> 01:36:51.222
roll because it's currently inside Faerie Fire, so
take the higher of the two rolls.

01:36:51.222 --> 01:36:56.204
LIAM: I would just like to say that Pike is very
eerie, yet beautiful in this iridescent glow of

01:36:56.204 --> 01:37:00.185
astral projection. It's hard to hear her
sometimes, but god damn it,

01:37:00.185 --> 01:37:01.663
she makes it look good.

01:37:01.663 --> 01:37:05.593
ASHLEY: Oh. Oh my god. I rolled a one and a
natural 20.

01:37:05.593 --> 01:37:07.808
(cheering)

01:37:07.808 --> 01:37:11.602
ASHLEY: What?

01:37:11.602 --> 01:37:19.930
MATT: Okay. So at 4th level, that would be 7d6
radiant damage.

01:37:19.930 --> 01:37:21.556
LAURA and MARISHA: Whoa!

01:37:21.556 --> 01:37:23.518
MARISHA: Wait, what did you cast?

01:37:23.518 --> 01:37:25.077
LAURA and TRAVIS: Guiding Bolt.

01:37:25.077 --> 01:37:26.389
MARISHA: Oh, fuck yeah!

01:37:26.389 --> 01:37:30.765
TALIESIN: 7d6?

01:37:30.765 --> 01:37:31.819
MATT: Yeah.

01:37:31.819 --> 01:37:33.037
SAM: That's a lot of d6.

01:37:33.037 --> 01:37:34.500
TALIESIN: Times two?

01:37:34.500 --> 01:37:36.262
LAURA: Is it times two after that because it's a
crit?

01:37:36.262 --> 01:37:40.552
MARISHA: It's a crit? Oh, right, because that's--
well, it's straight dice rolls. Or does she roll

01:37:40.552 --> 01:37:44.418
dice twice?

01:37:44.418 --> 01:37:49.279
MATT: For the purpose of ease, I usually double.
I'm just confirming one thing real fast.

01:37:49.279 --> 01:37:52.555
LIAM: She has just blinded us all in holy light is
what I'm assuming.

01:37:52.555 --> 01:37:54.205
MATT: Yeah, so go ahead and do your math.

01:37:54.205 --> 01:37:55.494
MARISHA: Little holy nuke.

01:37:55.494 --> 01:37:57.261
SAM: That's my Pike.

01:37:57.261 --> 01:37:58.657
ASHLEY: Okay.

01:37:58.657 --> 01:38:01.513
LAURA: What was it, Pike?

01:38:01.513 --> 01:38:03.074
ASHLEY: 21.

01:38:03.074 --> 01:38:04.297
LAURA: 21.

01:38:04.297 --> 01:38:06.149
MATT: 21. All right.

01:38:06.149 --> 01:38:09.267
LAURA: Times two?

01:38:09.267 --> 01:38:12.668
MARISHA: Times two, right?

01:38:12.668 --> 01:38:13.680
LAURA: Please?

01:38:13.680 --> 01:38:16.608
MATT: Yep, so that would be times two. Just
confirming. It has been a while since we've had

01:38:16.608 --> 01:38:21.798
any sort of spell-based crit. So that would be 42
points of radiant damage.

01:38:21.798 --> 01:38:23.329
LAURA, ASHLEY, and MARISHA: Whoa!

01:38:23.329 --> 01:38:28.281
MATT: As you release this bolt of energy out of
your hand, you see it charges up and fills up your

01:38:28.281 --> 01:38:33.448
hand, shaking, as you're waiting for the moment
where it might be too much to control, and your

01:38:33.448 --> 01:38:45.359
holy symbol flares as it releases and streaks
forward, right behind you. You were technically in

01:38:45.359 --> 01:38:51.538
melee with it, which would have given you
disadvantage on the attack, but you had advantage

01:38:51.538 --> 01:38:55.419
on him because of that and... we'll say it's fine.
It stays there because there were a lot of things

01:38:55.419 --> 01:38:59.118
giving advantage against him and then
disadvantage. We'll stay with it. As you turn

01:38:59.118 --> 01:39:02.714
around, you release it. Point blank, it slams into
the front and you can see where the smoke was

01:39:02.714 --> 01:39:06.719
swelling around it, it almost seems to be
scattered away from the impact of this radiant

01:39:06.719 --> 01:39:12.023
bolt, and for a second, this image of this
obscured, shadowy humanoid becomes very clear and

01:39:12.023 --> 01:39:18.076
you can see this extremely muscular humanoid torso
with elongated, exaggerated arms and fingers.

01:39:18.076 --> 01:39:26.317
Seemingly featureless across its body other than
its black, obsidian torso. No legs. They disappear

01:39:26.317 --> 01:39:33.290
into the smoke beneath it. Its head has the long,
hooked, birdlike skull beak, and where the eyes

01:39:33.290 --> 01:39:39.840
are, it's just this smooth, almost leathery
texture across the dark body itself. You can see

01:39:39.840 --> 01:39:45.550
what looks like faint horns that curve around the
back, that curl upward. And as it takes the

01:39:45.550 --> 01:39:51.701
impact, its head rolls back and you can hear this
billowing scream: (moaning cry) As it leans back

01:39:51.701 --> 01:39:57.274
forward towards you, it looks like it's having a
rough moment. Now we get to its turn.

01:39:57.274 --> 01:39:58.240
LAURA: Oh no.

01:39:58.240 --> 01:40:02.014
MATT: All right.

01:40:02.014 --> 01:40:08.750
TRAVIS: It farts a little cloud of smoke.

01:40:08.750 --> 01:40:11.531
TALIESIN: A lot of us are outside the Faerie
Fire.

01:40:11.531 --> 01:40:18.395
MATT: Based on that, it zeroes down on the little
ball of radiant energy staring before it that just

01:40:18.395 --> 01:40:24.468
blasted a hole in its form. It's going to take all
three of its strikes at you, Pike.

01:40:24.468 --> 01:40:26.777
TALIESIN: It's got disadvantage on its attacks.

01:40:26.777 --> 01:40:31.701
MATT: And has advantage because she's in Faerie
Fire, so it cancels it to a natural attack. That

01:40:31.701 --> 01:40:38.441
is 21. What's your AC?

01:40:38.441 --> 01:40:40.481
ASHLEY: 20.

01:40:40.481 --> 01:40:46.529
MATT: 20, so that hits. 27. And a natural one.

01:40:46.529 --> 01:40:47.930
MARISHA: Oh!

01:40:47.930 --> 01:40:49.943
MATT: It was like 19... one.

01:40:49.943 --> 01:40:51.400
ASHLEY: (laughs)

01:40:51.400 --> 01:41:05.429
MATT: All right, so... That would be 14 points of
psychic damage.

01:41:05.429 --> 01:41:07.389
ASHLEY: Okay.

01:41:07.389 --> 01:41:15.903
MATT: Oh. No, I'm sorry, because of the roll
there-- that's 14 plus an additional 12, so that's

01:41:15.903 --> 01:41:17.682
16 for the first strike.

01:41:17.682 --> 01:41:21.431
SAM: (quietly) 12? That's 26.

01:41:21.431 --> 01:41:26.630
MATT: Right, it was 12 on top of the original
amount, which I said was 16?

01:41:26.630 --> 01:41:28.745
SAM: 14.

01:41:28.745 --> 01:41:29.856
TALIESIN: 14 and then 12.

01:41:29.856 --> 01:41:33.674
MATT: 14 and 12, yeah, so it was 26 psychic damage
you took on the first strike and the second one

01:41:33.674 --> 01:41:35.571
was seven, too. 21.

01:41:35.571 --> 01:41:37.837
ASHLEY: I thought the second one failed?

01:41:37.837 --> 01:41:39.636
MATT: The third one. It has three attacks.

01:41:39.636 --> 01:41:41.668
ASHLEY: Oh, there's three.

01:41:41.668 --> 01:41:42.717
MATT: Yeah.

01:41:42.717 --> 01:41:44.517
ASHLEY: Okay, so what was the total, sorry?

01:41:44.517 --> 01:41:51.445
MATT: It would be 26 and 21, so yeah, 47 points of
psychic damage as its arm reaches out towards you

01:41:51.445 --> 01:41:57.278
and strikes. Also, I need you to make a wisdom
saving throw.

01:41:57.278 --> 01:41:58.381
TALIESIN: With advantage.

01:41:58.381 --> 01:41:59.547
MATT: With advantage.

01:41:59.547 --> 01:42:01.968
SAM: And with beauty.

01:42:01.968 --> 01:42:04.016
TALIESIN: Grace. Dignity.

01:42:04.016 --> 01:42:05.681
LIAM: Skype.

01:42:05.681 --> 01:42:16.172
ASHLEY: Okay. 20.

01:42:16.172 --> 01:42:18.193
MATT: You're doing your Hunter's Mark damage?

01:42:18.193 --> 01:42:19.655
LAURA: Oh. Yeah, I did.

01:42:19.655 --> 01:42:20.714
MATT: So what was that?

01:42:20.714 --> 01:42:21.624
LIAM: 20.

01:42:21.624 --> 01:42:22.516
ASHLEY: 20.

01:42:22.516 --> 01:42:28.357
MATT: 20. Yeah, you feel as its claws move through
your body, elements of its shadow essence reach up

01:42:28.357 --> 01:42:33.083
and try to grasp an element of your willpower. You
shrug it off. The might of Sarenrae is too strong

01:42:33.083 --> 01:42:35.535
and it has no way of grasping your intent.

01:42:35.535 --> 01:42:36.616
TRAVIS: Yeah, it is.

01:42:36.616 --> 01:42:38.410
ASHLEY: Yeah, get out of here!

01:42:38.410 --> 01:42:45.232
MATT: Unfortunately, that used all of its
movement. It cannot withdraw into the room. That

01:42:45.232 --> 01:42:50.643
will be the end of its turn. Let's see if that
recharges. Oh, it does. Okay.

01:42:50.643 --> 01:42:52.502
That brings us to Grog.

01:42:52.502 --> 01:42:53.574
TRAVIS: It does?

01:42:53.574 --> 01:42:54.842
MATT: Yep, you're back up to your turn now.

01:42:54.842 --> 01:42:56.345
TRAVIS: (grunts) I want to hit it again!

01:42:56.345 --> 01:42:57.467
MATT: Go for it.

01:42:57.467 --> 01:43:00.147
TRAVIS: Do I have advantage?

01:43:00.147 --> 01:43:01.584
MARISHA: Yes.

01:43:01.584 --> 01:43:04.442
TRAVIS: Faerie Fire. That's better. 24.

01:43:04.442 --> 01:43:06.112
MATT: Okay.

01:43:06.112 --> 01:43:10.524
TRAVIS: The second one is... 21.

01:43:10.524 --> 01:43:11.605
MATT: Hits.

01:43:11.605 --> 01:43:12.645
TRAVIS: Nice.

01:43:12.645 --> 01:43:14.000
MATT: Just barely.

01:43:14.000 --> 01:43:19.481
TRAVIS: First one is 15.

01:43:19.481 --> 01:43:20.862
MATT: Okay.

01:43:20.862 --> 01:43:28.746
TRAVIS: 18.

01:43:28.746 --> 01:43:36.443
MATT: 18, okay. You hit the side of its body and
you can see now, small cracks in its black form

01:43:36.443 --> 01:43:40.011
are starting to form and you can see a bit of that
purplish energy leaking out. It's starting to

01:43:40.011 --> 01:43:48.514
actually visibly show a difficulty in keeping its
corporeal form. As both blows slam into it, you

01:43:48.514 --> 01:43:53.526
can see it shaking, and there is a struggle to its
movement. Do you want to stay where you are, or do

01:43:53.526 --> 01:43:54.774
you want to move?

01:43:54.774 --> 01:43:55.721
TRAVIS: I'll stay where I am.

01:43:55.721 --> 01:43:57.173
MATT: Okay. Keyleth.

01:43:57.173 --> 01:44:01.627
MARISHA: He's totally surrounded, pretty much,
right?

01:44:01.627 --> 01:44:02.716
MATT: Essentially.

01:44:02.716 --> 01:44:06.723
MARISHA: Yeah. I'm actually going to throw up--
I'm going to maintain my Faerie Fire.

01:44:06.723 --> 01:44:07.923
SAM: You're going to throw up?

01:44:07.923 --> 01:44:08.907
MARISHA: I'm going to-- yes.

01:44:08.907 --> 01:44:10.104
TALIESIN and MARISHA: (retching noises)

01:44:10.104 --> 01:44:11.379
(laughter)

01:44:11.379 --> 01:44:14.008
MARISHA: (dry-heaving noises) It's purple.

01:44:14.008 --> 01:44:15.975
SAM: I hold her hair back.

01:44:15.975 --> 01:44:21.148
MARISHA: And I say, (slurred) I'm sorry. I'm so
sorry.

01:44:21.148 --> 01:44:22.621
SAM: That's okay. It's okay.

01:44:22.621 --> 01:44:29.659
MARISHA: (laughing) How tall is the ceiling?

01:44:29.659 --> 01:44:31.290
TALIESIN: 12 feet.

01:44:31.290 --> 01:44:32.558
MATT: About 12 feet, yeah.

01:44:32.558 --> 01:44:37.323
MARISHA: I'm going to take a Daylight beam and go
(bing) right over top of it like a nice pretty

01:44:37.323 --> 01:44:38.383
spotlight.

01:44:38.383 --> 01:44:39.443
MATT: Okay.

01:44:39.443 --> 01:44:40.547
TRAVIS: Ah!

01:44:40.547 --> 01:44:44.671
MATT: All right. Which, that is a concentration
spell.

01:44:44.671 --> 01:44:47.474
MARISHA: It's not, actually. It's an action that
lasts for an hour.

01:44:47.474 --> 01:44:50.005
MATT: Interesting! I would assume that was.

01:44:50.005 --> 01:44:52.793
MARISHA: I looked it up just now.

01:44:52.793 --> 01:44:59.616
MATT: This little spark ball of daylight opens up
on the ceiling like a bright spotlight that fills

01:44:59.616 --> 01:45:03.651
the area. As it does, you can see the creature
(howling groan) shrinks away from it, and its

01:45:03.651 --> 01:45:06.507
smoke actually dissipates, lowering its armor
class again.

01:45:06.507 --> 01:45:08.721
SAM: Oh, that's a good move!

01:45:08.721 --> 01:45:12.481
MATT: All right. Are you going to stay where you
are, or are you going to move?

01:45:12.481 --> 01:45:14.947
MARISHA: I'll take another step back.

01:45:14.947 --> 01:45:16.041
MATT: Okay.

01:45:16.041 --> 01:45:17.193
MARISHA: That's good.

01:45:17.193 --> 01:45:28.491
MATT: All right. With that... Okay. There's a
momentary whisper in the shadow around you. And

01:45:28.491 --> 01:45:33.296
the sound of chains. I want everyone to make a
perception check.

01:45:33.296 --> 01:45:34.594
MARISHA: What?

01:45:34.594 --> 01:45:37.734
TALIESIN: Damn!

01:45:37.734 --> 01:45:40.366
TRAVIS: So close.

01:45:40.366 --> 01:45:41.437
TALIESIN: 26.

01:45:41.437 --> 01:45:42.654
MATT: 26.

01:45:42.654 --> 01:45:43.589
TRAVIS: 19.

01:45:43.589 --> 01:45:44.416
LAURA: 20.

01:45:44.416 --> 01:45:45.323
LIAM: 20.

01:45:45.323 --> 01:45:46.229
SAM: 17.

01:45:46.229 --> 01:45:47.086
MARISHA: 16.

01:45:47.086 --> 01:45:48.106
SAM: Pike?

01:45:48.106 --> 01:45:48.996
ASHLEY: 17.

01:45:48.996 --> 01:45:52.208
MATT: Okay. So all of you continue focusing.

01:45:52.208 --> 01:45:55.408
SAM: Oh, whispers! Whispers and whispers.

01:45:55.408 --> 01:45:59.117
LIAM: The whispers are back! It's like we're back
in Casa de WillingBlam.

01:45:59.117 --> 01:46:03.175
MARISHA: Whispers are so exciting.

01:46:03.175 --> 01:46:07.398
LAURA: I know. I really did miss the whispers. I
hadn't even realized how much I

01:46:07.398 --> 01:46:08.758
missed them until today.

01:46:08.758 --> 01:46:14.616
SAM: Ashley, Matt is whispering in Taliesin's ear,
just so you know.

01:46:14.616 --> 01:46:15.889
MARISHA: Sweet nothings.

01:46:15.889 --> 01:46:17.886
TALIESIN: Fuck. Really?

01:46:17.886 --> 01:46:20.518
LAURA: He's licking his ear a lot.

01:46:20.561 --> 01:46:23.086
ASHLEY: He's giving him a wet willie?

01:46:23.086 --> 01:46:24.389
SAM: Yes.

01:46:24.389 --> 01:46:25.753
LIAM: Really, really.

01:46:25.753 --> 01:46:28.354
MATT: All right. Pike, you're up. What's your
turn?

01:46:28.354 --> 01:46:34.537
ASHLEY: Oh. Okay. I'm going to Guiding Bolt it
again.

01:46:34.537 --> 01:46:38.119
MATT: Okay. Same deal?

01:46:38.119 --> 01:46:40.114
TALIESIN: I can't tell you yet. It's not my turn.

01:46:40.114 --> 01:46:47.703
MATT: Go ahead and make your single attack roll
right now because the previous thing is--

01:46:47.703 --> 01:46:49.277
ASHLEY: (sighs) Ten.

01:46:49.277 --> 01:46:54.074
MATT: Okay. Yeah, so this time, it's ready for you
and it dodges out of the way. The blast hits the

01:46:54.074 --> 01:46:59.342
stone wall behind it and cracks it slightly. Do
you want to move or stay where you are?

01:46:59.342 --> 01:47:01.823
ASHLEY: Yeah, I'll move away from it.

01:47:01.823 --> 01:47:03.585
MATT: It will get an attack of opportunity on
you.

01:47:03.585 --> 01:47:08.325
ASHLEY: Wait, hold on a minute. I should probably
take a potion or something.

01:47:08.325 --> 01:47:09.963
MATT: It's up to you.

01:47:09.963 --> 01:47:11.093
LAURA: Are you low?

01:47:11.093 --> 01:47:12.683
ASHLEY: I'm pretty low.

01:47:12.683 --> 01:47:14.006
LAURA: Pike!

01:47:14.006 --> 01:47:15.852
MARISHA: Oh, I could have done something about
that.

01:47:15.852 --> 01:47:25.011
ASHLEY: Nope. It's okay. I'm going to take a--
what do I have in here? It just says I have a

01:47:25.011 --> 01:47:26.860
healing potion. God, I don't know what that
means.

01:47:26.860 --> 01:47:30.324
MATT: That would be the lowest. That's 2d4 plus
two.

01:47:30.324 --> 01:47:34.208
LAURA: Didn't you get healed from your own
healing?

01:47:34.208 --> 01:47:40.716
ASHLEY: Well, I don't have enough-- I don't think
I have enough left. I want to save them.

01:47:40.716 --> 01:47:41.802
LAURA: Yeah.

01:47:41.802 --> 01:47:47.560
ASHLEY: Okay. Two. Six. Okay, eight.

01:47:47.560 --> 01:47:50.884
MATT: Okay, you heal eight and did you want to
move back or stay where you are?

01:47:50.884 --> 01:47:53.676
ASHLEY: I'll stay.

01:47:53.676 --> 01:48:06.081
MATT: Okay, so you stay where you are. All right.
Cassandra keeps running off this way and halts for

01:48:06.081 --> 01:48:07.044
a second.

01:48:07.044 --> 01:48:10.855
SAM: Wait, who's that? Who's going? Oh, that's
Cassandra? We're okay with her running away?

01:48:10.855 --> 01:48:12.036
LAURA: She's running away.

01:48:12.036 --> 01:48:15.872
MATT: He sent her running away. Top is Vex. You're
up.

01:48:15.872 --> 01:48:16.746
LAURA: Me?

01:48:16.746 --> 01:48:17.702
MATT: Yes.

01:48:17.702 --> 01:48:23.660
LAURA: Okay. Who all's around him? Pike and Grog?

01:48:23.660 --> 01:48:27.055
MATT: Pike and Grog and technically Trinket, as
well, are all in melee.

01:48:27.055 --> 01:48:30.383
LAURA: All right, then I'm going to shoot a couple
of arrows at him again, man.

01:48:30.383 --> 01:48:31.435
MATT: Okay.

01:48:31.435 --> 01:48:34.471
LAURA: I can't do anything. But he's still
advantage, right?

01:48:34.471 --> 01:48:37.073
MATT: It's advantage against him, yes.

01:48:37.073 --> 01:48:43.217
LAURA: 21?

01:48:43.217 --> 01:48:44.717
MATT: 21 hits.

01:48:44.717 --> 01:48:48.419
LAURA: And 28.

01:48:48.419 --> 01:48:49.958
MATT: Both hit. Go ahead and roll damage.

01:48:49.958 --> 01:48:51.381
LAURA: Okay.

01:48:51.381 --> 01:48:57.672
MATT: These will be your last holy arrows because
you've used six.

01:48:57.672 --> 01:48:59.839
LAURA: No. I'm out of holy arrows.

01:48:59.839 --> 01:49:01.083
MATT: Okay, yeah, that's right.

01:49:01.083 --> 01:49:02.982
LAURA: Because one of them was my exploding
arrow.

01:49:02.982 --> 01:49:04.934
MATT: Yeah, so these are just regular.

01:49:04.934 --> 01:49:15.308
LAURA: So that's... 21 for the first.

01:49:15.308 --> 01:49:16.506
MATT: Nice, all right.

01:49:16.506 --> 01:49:19.218
LAURA: Shitballs. Well, there you go. Goodbye.

01:49:19.218 --> 01:49:22.418
LIAM: It was a 20.

01:49:22.418 --> 01:49:25.678
LAURA: 21 for the second.

01:49:25.678 --> 01:49:30.936
MATT: Nice. 42 points of damage this round. These
arrows now find their way towards the cracks that

01:49:30.936 --> 01:49:35.431
are starting to appear in its chest and as each
one strikes in, these arrows are actually visibly

01:49:35.431 --> 01:49:40.577
staying in its body. What was once this amorphous
smoke, after the impacts from Grog and as it

01:49:40.577 --> 01:49:44.935
begins to wear itself down, it's starting to find
it harder and harder to keep this ethereal form,

01:49:44.935 --> 01:49:49.066
so now these arrows are sticking out of these
cracks of purplish, glowing energy and it's moving

01:49:49.066 --> 01:49:50.634
a little more sluggishly.

01:49:50.634 --> 01:49:52.458
LAURA: I hide again for my bonus.

01:49:52.458 --> 01:49:58.779
MATT: Okay. Make a stealth check. Scanlan, you're
up.

01:49:58.779 --> 01:50:00.266
SAM: Scanlan's up?

01:50:00.266 --> 01:50:01.776
LAURA: 21 stealth.

01:50:01.776 --> 01:50:04.901
MATT: Good to know. All right.

01:50:04.901 --> 01:50:06.957
SAM: Do I have my wits about me?

01:50:06.957 --> 01:50:07.771
MATT: You do.

01:50:07.771 --> 01:50:08.799
SAM: Oh, that's nice.

01:50:08.799 --> 01:50:13.604
MATT: You just feel like there's an aspect-- you
get the sense you probably don't want to be close

01:50:13.604 --> 01:50:14.936
to it.

01:50:14.936 --> 01:50:18.587
SAM: Okay. I charge at it! No.

01:50:18.587 --> 01:50:20.464
(laughter)

01:50:20.464 --> 01:50:22.988
MATT: That's the Scanlan I know and love.

01:50:22.988 --> 01:50:26.713
SAM: I have so little that I can do.

01:50:26.713 --> 01:50:28.819
MATT: Suddenly there's a stained-glass wall behind
it.

01:50:28.819 --> 01:50:31.025
TALIESIN: Wow, in-joke.

01:50:31.063 --> 01:50:43.637
SAM: As my bonus action, I will-- as my movement,
I (sighs) tragically, flip the gun to Percy.

01:50:43.637 --> 01:50:45.301
MATT: Okay.

01:50:45.301 --> 01:50:46.600
LIAM: It's two pieces.

01:50:46.600 --> 01:50:48.202
LAURA: No, the one that I gave him.

01:50:48.202 --> 01:50:52.303
SAM: No, the good gun. In the-- what's that Martin
Lawrence movie? Bad Boys. They did it all in slow

01:50:52.303 --> 01:50:59.406
motion. Just throw the gun. Okay. As a bonus
action, I will Healing Word Pike.

01:50:59.406 --> 01:51:00.710
MATT: Okay.

01:51:00.710 --> 01:51:01.957
SAM: Did she heal herself okay?

01:51:01.957 --> 01:51:03.045
LAURA: No, she didn't.

01:51:03.045 --> 01:51:10.640
SAM: Okay, I will Healing Word her, and I'll sing,
believe it or not, you're made mostly of air. I

01:51:10.640 --> 01:51:14.752
never thought you could feel so free.

01:51:14.752 --> 01:51:17.496
MATT: All right, what level are you using Healing
Word at?

01:51:17.496 --> 01:51:18.769
SAM: Just at one.

01:51:18.769 --> 01:51:19.712
MATT: Level one? Okay.

01:51:19.712 --> 01:51:22.676
SAM: d4 plus five. Lame.

01:51:22.676 --> 01:51:24.802
MATT: 1d4 plus five.

01:51:24.802 --> 01:51:26.849
SAM: Eight. Eight, honey. I love you.

01:51:26.849 --> 01:51:28.983
ASHLEY: "Thanks!" I blow him a smoke kiss.

01:51:28.983 --> 01:51:39.098
SAM: Oh! I love it. And then for my move, my
action, my whatever you call it... I've got

01:51:39.098 --> 01:51:47.281
fucking nothing, man! I say to the beast, to the
whatever it is, I say, and another thing! Your

01:51:47.281 --> 01:51:55.984
smoking encourages minors to smoke and creates an
aura that makes going to restaurants not pleasant

01:51:55.984 --> 01:52:01.476
and it's just horrible. It makes your clothes
stink. It's terrible. So another Vicious

01:52:01.476 --> 01:52:02.650
Mockery.

01:52:02.650 --> 01:52:06.388
TRAVIS: (laughing) Please. Please be enough.

01:52:06.388 --> 01:52:09.583
TALIESIN: Please let this be what kills him.

01:52:09.583 --> 01:52:12.667
MARISHA: Please. He's laughing like it is.
Wouldn't that be the third time this has

01:52:12.667 --> 01:52:13.758
happened?

01:52:13.758 --> 01:52:18.116
MATT: All right. Roll damage. 3d4 psychic damage.

01:52:18.116 --> 01:52:21.198
LAURA: Come on, come on.

01:52:21.198 --> 01:52:22.250
SAM: Eight.

01:52:22.250 --> 01:52:29.332
MATT: Eight. All right. You can see now, it turns
to you for a second and the Mark of Vengeance

01:52:29.332 --> 01:52:36.694
fades as suddenly you feel like you've damaged it
mentally enough to the point where it doesn't even

01:52:36.694 --> 01:52:39.854
want to deal with you anymore. You're far too
mean.

01:52:39.854 --> 01:52:42.232
TRAVIS: (laughing) You're too mean.

01:52:42.232 --> 01:52:44.311
SAM: Take that!

01:52:44.357 --> 01:52:46.648
MATT: You're going to stay where you are?

01:52:46.648 --> 01:52:47.582
SAM: Yes.

01:52:47.582 --> 01:52:49.626
MATT: Okay, that ends your turn. Percy,
you're up.

01:52:49.626 --> 01:52:53.288
TALIESIN: I yell, Delilah's getting away!

01:52:53.329 --> 01:52:59.355
MATT: You guys all glance over. The shackles that
are on the ground are now collapsed and empty.

01:52:59.355 --> 01:53:00.554
SAM: Oh shit!

01:53:00.554 --> 01:53:05.894
MATT: With the gag safely removed from her mouth
during this allowed her to cast Misty Step, which

01:53:05.894 --> 01:53:10.000
is a verbal-based spell. She is currently--

01:53:10.000 --> 01:53:11.278
TALIESIN: How far away?

01:53:11.278 --> 01:53:13.021
MATT: I'm calculating that right now.

01:53:13.021 --> 01:53:14.553
TALIESIN: And can I see her?

01:53:14.553 --> 01:53:17.967
MATT: I'm going to have to ask you to roll a
perception check here in a minute.

01:53:17.967 --> 01:53:18.996
TALIESIN: Okay.

01:53:18.996 --> 01:53:20.629
LAURA: Oh my god.

01:53:20.629 --> 01:53:25.729
TALIESIN: And the question is-- yeah, I'm curious
how far she got.

01:53:25.729 --> 01:53:30.275
TRAVIS: We didn't bind her?

01:53:30.275 --> 01:53:32.419
LAURA: Because we're morons.

01:53:32.419 --> 01:53:33.918
TRAVIS: Well, she got out of her manacles.

01:53:33.918 --> 01:53:36.234
MARISHA: She Misty Stepped, so she turned into
air.

01:53:36.234 --> 01:53:43.342
MATT: She landed, cast Invisibility, and vanished,
and you just hear the footsteps down the hall.

01:53:43.342 --> 01:53:48.549
You're not quite sure where she is or how far
she's gotten, but you know she's down that way.

01:53:48.549 --> 01:53:50.249
LAURA: (gasps) Cassandra!

01:53:50.249 --> 01:53:51.576
TALIESIN: Cassandra's right there.

01:53:51.576 --> 01:53:56.459
MATT: Yeah. Cassandra doesn't notice. She's just
been running because you told her to run. She did

01:53:56.459 --> 01:54:01.020
hear you shout and she looked over her shoulder,
but not in time for her to see anything happen,

01:54:01.020 --> 01:54:06.715
because this all happened during the last round,
during your realization. You guys look around and

01:54:06.715 --> 01:54:10.034
Delilah's gone. You're the only one who really saw
the direction she's going, but it's your turn.

01:54:10.034 --> 01:54:13.657
TRAVIS: Son of a bitch, we left her alive.

01:54:13.657 --> 01:54:15.921
LAURA: I cannot believe we left her alive!

01:54:15.921 --> 01:54:17.853
SAM: I'm sure it'll be fine.

01:54:17.853 --> 01:54:21.537
TRAVIS: I'm fucking pissed.

01:54:21.537 --> 01:54:28.112
SAM: Maybe she's learned the error of her ways.

01:54:28.112 --> 01:54:31.211
MATT: What are you doing?

01:54:31.211 --> 01:54:34.116
TALIESIN: Fuck! Ugh. Okay, I'm going to--

01:54:34.116 --> 01:54:35.452
SAM: Chase her?

01:54:35.452 --> 01:54:36.774
MARISHA: Tell us where she is.

01:54:36.774 --> 01:54:44.216
TALIESIN: I'm going to-- fuck! Ugh, goddamn it.
I'm going to double my speed. I'm going to burn my

01:54:44.216 --> 01:54:46.079
turn double-speeding, trying to--

01:54:46.079 --> 01:54:48.504
MATT: Trying to catch up?

01:54:48.504 --> 01:54:49.642
TALIESIN: Trying to catch up.

01:54:49.642 --> 01:54:50.630
MATT: Okay.

01:54:50.630 --> 01:54:54.084
TALIESIN: And then as I pass my sister, I yell,
she went this way. She's invisible.

01:54:54.084 --> 01:54:54.976
MATT: Okay.

01:54:54.976 --> 01:54:55.847
SAM: Do I hear that?

01:54:55.847 --> 01:54:57.155
TALIESIN: She went this way! She's invisible!

01:54:57.155 --> 01:54:57.946
SAM: I hear it.

01:54:57.946 --> 01:54:58.954
MARISHA: We hear it.

01:54:58.954 --> 01:54:59.710
LIAM: Yep.

01:54:59.710 --> 01:55:01.409
MATT: All right, so that's Percy's turn.

01:55:01.409 --> 01:55:03.038
TALIESIN: I'm so sorry, everybody.

01:55:03.038 --> 01:55:05.686
MATT: For the situation, make a perception check.

01:55:05.686 --> 01:55:06.885
TALIESIN: All right.

01:55:06.885 --> 01:55:08.982
ASHLEY: You've got to do what you've got to do.

01:55:08.982 --> 01:55:13.342
TALIESIN: Do I have--

01:55:13.342 --> 01:55:16.760
MATT: No. You do not have advantage on this.

01:55:16.760 --> 01:55:18.568
TALIESIN: I'm adding my bonus die.

01:55:18.568 --> 01:55:19.903
SAM: You have inspiration.

01:55:19.903 --> 01:55:26.020
TALIESIN: Yeah, I haven't used my inspiration die.
23.

01:55:26.020 --> 01:55:31.873
MATT: 23. Okay. You see a couple of the recent
footsteps, but you don't see them freshly being

01:55:31.873 --> 01:55:35.139
made, so you know she's not too far yet.

01:55:35.139 --> 01:55:39.837
TALIESIN: I'm going to follow that path of
footsteps. I'm keeping an eye on them.

01:55:39.837 --> 01:55:42.586
MATT: Good to know. Vax, you're up.

01:55:42.586 --> 01:55:47.383
LIAM: All right, I'm going to use my bonus action
to dash and run 60 feet after Percy to catch up.

01:55:47.383 --> 01:55:49.965
LAURA: What? You're not going to kill the smoke
beast?

01:55:49.965 --> 01:55:51.921
LIAM: You're going to kill the smoke beast.

01:55:51.921 --> 01:55:56.573
MATT: Okay, so you use your bonus dash, your
movement to get there, so you move up 60.

01:55:56.573 --> 01:56:02.837
LIAM: So that's 60 feet from where I was? Okay,
and I'm going to throw a dagger after-- well, can

01:56:02.837 --> 01:56:05.576
I do a perception check and that, or is that two
different things?

01:56:05.576 --> 01:56:09.805
MATT: Honestly, once the creature's invisible and
you don't know where it was, you don't even get a

01:56:09.805 --> 01:56:12.647
chance to check at this distance, so it's just
attacking at disadvantage.

01:56:12.647 --> 01:56:14.329
LIAM: All right, I'm going to attack at
disadvantage, then.

01:56:14.329 --> 01:56:15.648
MATT: All right.

01:56:15.648 --> 01:56:21.625
LIAM: That is a 14.

01:56:21.625 --> 01:56:28.381
MATT: 14 is a miss. (whoosh) It returns to your
belt. Finds no purchase.

01:56:28.381 --> 01:56:30.125
LIAM: No, it was an 18.

01:56:30.125 --> 01:56:31.962
LAURA: It was an 18. He rolled 18.

01:56:31.962 --> 01:56:33.855
MATT: That was an 18?

01:56:33.855 --> 01:56:41.573
LIAM: Yeah. Seven plus 11 is 18.

01:56:41.573 --> 01:56:47.344
MATT: Seven plus 11 is indeed 18. Go ahead and
roll damage.

01:56:47.344 --> 01:56:49.108
LAURA: See?

01:56:49.108 --> 01:56:50.696
LIAM: Thanks. Thanks, sis.

01:56:50.696 --> 01:56:53.457
LAURA: No problem. This is why I look over your
shoulder even when my math is bad.

01:56:53.457 --> 01:56:58.991
LIAM: Okay, that is eight.

01:56:58.991 --> 01:57:00.746
MATT: Eight? Okay.

01:57:00.746 --> 01:57:02.453
LAURA: But she was almost unconscious.

01:57:02.453 --> 01:57:08.548
MATT: At this point, as you're running, you're
rushing forward. To the left of your ear, you hear

01:57:08.548 --> 01:57:16.505
(impact noise) and you glance over your shoulder.
And there, face down on the ground, is Delilah,

01:57:16.505 --> 01:57:20.513
sprawled out, face down in the dirt with a single
dagger sticking out of the center of her back.

01:57:20.513 --> 01:57:22.636
LIAM: For a second.

01:57:22.636 --> 01:57:24.570
LAURA: And then it's gone.

01:57:24.570 --> 01:57:28.642
MATT: And then it disappears. And blood begins to
pour out from the wound.

01:57:28.642 --> 01:57:29.987
SAM: She's dead. You killed her.

01:57:29.987 --> 01:57:31.269
MATT: All right.

01:57:31.269 --> 01:57:33.948
TALIESIN: Is she dead?

01:57:33.948 --> 01:57:45.737
MATT: You'd have to go and inspect. Now it is
Orthax's turn. Orthax is going to move here, still

01:57:45.737 --> 01:57:50.406
remain in melee, and is going to use a secondary
rampage pulse, since it recharges. Gives out

01:57:50.406 --> 01:57:58.785
another desperate scream (raspy roar) outwards in
the vicinity. 20-foot radius. I need Keyleth, Vex,

01:57:58.785 --> 01:58:05.110
Trinket, Pike, and Grog to all make wisdom saving
throws with advantage.

01:58:05.110 --> 01:58:08.102
MARISHA: I'll take a 12.

01:58:08.102 --> 01:58:10.138
MATT: 12?

01:58:10.138 --> 01:58:11.234
MARISHA: 25 total.

01:58:11.234 --> 01:58:12.274
MATT: Oh, 25 total.

01:58:12.274 --> 01:58:13.247
TRAVIS: 12.

01:58:13.247 --> 01:58:14.274
MATT: 12.

01:58:14.274 --> 01:58:17.344
LAURA: Wait. 19 for me.

01:58:17.344 --> 01:58:25.886
ASHLEY: 22.

01:58:25.886 --> 01:58:28.116
LAURA: 13 for Trinket.

01:58:28.116 --> 01:58:37.208
MATT: Okay, so Vex, Keyleth, and Pike, you guys
all take five points of psychic damage as you

01:58:37.208 --> 01:58:46.903
cover your ears momentarily. Grog and Trinket both
take ten points of psychic damage. Both turn

01:58:46.903 --> 01:58:53.952
immediately, flanking Pike, who has been the
radiant blaster across this entity. I need you to

01:58:53.952 --> 01:58:57.648
make an attack and I need Trinket to make an
attack against Pike. You guys both have advantage

01:58:57.648 --> 01:58:59.503
because she's in the Faerie Fire.

01:58:59.503 --> 01:59:00.781
MARISHA: Fuck.

01:59:00.781 --> 01:59:05.219
TRAVIS: Yes! Three and a four. 13.

01:59:05.219 --> 01:59:06.579
MATT: 13. Okay.

01:59:06.579 --> 01:59:09.084
LIAM: Trinket rolled a natural 20.

01:59:09.084 --> 01:59:11.259
TALIESIN: Whoa!

01:59:11.259 --> 01:59:16.768
MATT: All right, so Pike. This blast comes out
ringing in your ears and as your vision comes back

01:59:16.768 --> 01:59:21.308
to you and you look up, all you see is Grog
lifting this giant hammer with his eyes clouded in

01:59:21.308 --> 01:59:25.887
the same black smoke material. You bring up your
shield and as the hammer comes down, striking at

01:59:25.887 --> 01:59:28.913
you, you know there's a bruise going to be on your
forearm tomorrow because the sheer force of it

01:59:28.913 --> 01:59:33.314
hits you, but at the same time, you know it's not
the friend you grew up with. And you look up into

01:59:33.314 --> 01:59:37.770
his face as the cloud fades and you can see an
expression of immediate regret on his face.

01:59:37.770 --> 01:59:39.544
TRAVIS: What? What did I do?

01:59:39.544 --> 01:59:45.636
MATT: Before you can respond, though, the bear
behind you. Trinket snarls (roar) and latches on.

01:59:45.636 --> 01:59:46.749
Go ahead and roll damage.

01:59:46.749 --> 01:59:49.080
LAURA: Do you want a bite attack or a claw
attack?

01:59:49.080 --> 01:59:51.084
MATT: I'm going to have to probably go bite on
this.

01:59:51.084 --> 01:59:54.482
ASHLEY: Oh no.

01:59:54.482 --> 02:00:01.048
MATT: So roll the dice and then that times two.

02:00:01.048 --> 02:00:05.296
LAURA: Oh, right, I have to-- no, yeah. Okay.
That's 11.

02:00:05.296 --> 02:00:10.638
MATT: So you take 11 points of piercing damage as
all of a sudden, Trinket sinks his jaws into the

02:00:10.638 --> 02:00:11.938
back of your shoulder.

02:00:11.938 --> 02:00:12.954
SAM: Times two?

02:00:12.954 --> 02:00:14.946
LIAM: Yeah, times two. Natural 20.

02:00:14.946 --> 02:00:17.195
MATT: Oh. Oh, that wasn't with the multiplier.
What did you roll on the dice?

02:00:17.195 --> 02:00:18.782
LAURA: I rolled 11.

02:00:18.782 --> 02:00:21.409
MATT: On the dice? So 22, plus whatever the
modifier is.

02:00:21.409 --> 02:00:23.877
LAURA: What? No!

02:00:23.877 --> 02:00:26.727
LIAM: That's eight plus the modifier.

02:00:26.727 --> 02:00:28.570
LAURA: Oh! Okay. 15!

02:00:28.570 --> 02:00:30.703
MATT: Okay, so 16 plus whatever the modifier is.

02:00:30.703 --> 02:00:32.051
TALIESIN: 19, then.

02:00:32.051 --> 02:00:35.174
LAURA: No, I rolled four. Times two is eight.

02:00:35.174 --> 02:00:37.137
LIAM: Plus the modifier of seven.

02:00:37.137 --> 02:00:38.340
LIAM and LAURA: Is 15.

02:00:38.340 --> 02:00:41.346
MATT: There we go. Thank you so much for
clarification. 15 points of piercing damage.

02:00:41.346 --> 02:00:42.785
TALIESIN: Math, everybody!

02:00:42.785 --> 02:00:49.868
MATT: And Trinket clenches down. You feel the armor
plates jamming together and it wrenches your

02:00:49.868 --> 02:00:54.162
shoulder out of the socket. Not enough to actually
do too much serious damage. And immediately

02:00:54.162 --> 02:00:59.460
Trinket pulls away and you hear this whine behind
you, this (sad moaning). His nose rubs against

02:00:59.460 --> 02:01:00.922
your head.

02:01:00.922 --> 02:01:03.707
ASHLEY: I put my hand out and touch his nose and
tell him it's okay.

02:01:03.707 --> 02:01:05.047
LAURA and MARISHA: Oh.

02:01:05.047 --> 02:01:18.986
MATT: Okay. Orthax is at a point where-- no.
Orthax is going to turn and begin to chase after

02:01:18.986 --> 02:01:20.444
Percy now.

02:01:20.444 --> 02:01:21.949
TALIESIN: Attack of opportunity.

02:01:21.949 --> 02:01:25.048
MATT: Yes, I know. Grog and Pike and Trinket all
get attacks of opportunity.

02:01:25.048 --> 02:01:26.247
MARISHA: Kill him!

02:01:26.247 --> 02:01:27.452
TRAVIS: With advantage?

02:01:27.452 --> 02:01:28.651
MATT: With advantage, yeah.

02:01:28.651 --> 02:01:34.604
TRAVIS: Natural 20. First roll. Don't even need to
do it again.

02:01:34.604 --> 02:01:37.214
MARISHA: Nat 20s all up in this bitch.

02:01:37.214 --> 02:01:38.442
LAURA: 24.

02:01:38.442 --> 02:01:39.653
MATT: Okay, and Pike?

02:01:39.653 --> 02:01:40.813
ASHLEY: 16.

02:01:40.813 --> 02:01:44.814
MATT: 16 does not hit, unfortunately. So Pike, you
swing, but, still in pain from Trinket's attack

02:01:44.814 --> 02:01:51.752
and Grog coming at you, you swing wide and it
passes through the space behind it. Grog, remember

02:01:51.752 --> 02:01:54.308
to roll with an additional d12, too, because of
your brutal critical.

02:01:54.308 --> 02:01:55.630
ASHLEY: Kill him.

02:01:55.630 --> 02:01:58.192
LAURA: 13 for Trinket.

02:01:58.192 --> 02:01:59.795
MATT: 13 for Trinket. Awesome.

02:01:59.795 --> 02:02:07.382
TRAVIS: (muttering) 20, 21, 22. (louder) 31
total.

02:02:07.382 --> 02:02:10.228
MATT: 31 total. How do you and Trinket want to do
this?

02:02:10.228 --> 02:02:12.785
(cheering)

02:02:12.785 --> 02:02:14.800
ASHLEY: Wait, did you kill him?

02:02:14.800 --> 02:02:15.899
LAURA: Yeah!

02:02:15.899 --> 02:02:17.017
ASHLEY: Oh, yes!

02:02:17.017 --> 02:02:22.308
TRAVIS: I'd like to pick up the hammer and slam
him down to the ground just so he's at Trinket's

02:02:22.308 --> 02:02:23.507
head height.

02:02:23.507 --> 02:02:27.906
LAURA: And then right when he gets to his height,
Trinket reaches up and bites him as hard as he can

02:02:27.906 --> 02:02:30.599
and lashes him around like dog with a toy.

02:02:30.599 --> 02:02:36.635
MATT: Okay. As you slam it on the ground, (boof)
the smoke billows out around it and dissipates for

02:02:36.635 --> 02:02:40.576
a moment where, as opposed to its obscured form,
you now have a very clear view of its physical

02:02:40.576 --> 02:02:44.680
body. Just a little bit of smoke trailing about
where its lower torso and legs would be. As its

02:02:44.680 --> 02:02:50.270
arms reach out (slashing noise, grunt) and it
looks up, its head shaking as the purple cracks

02:02:50.270 --> 02:02:55.658
are rising up its body, it looks up straight into
the face of Trinket, who snarls. (growl, chomp)

02:02:55.658 --> 02:03:01.289
And just lunges out, clamping onto its face and
tearing upward, its head arcing in the air. As it

02:03:01.289 --> 02:03:08.133
does, the body (whoosh) dissipates into smoke and
sinks into the ground into this black shadow in

02:03:08.133 --> 02:03:12.794
the dirt that (whoosh) races up the hallway in the
direction of Percy.

02:03:12.794 --> 02:03:16.875
Percy, as you're stopping and looking over, you
look down just in time for the shadow to (whoosh)

02:03:16.875 --> 02:03:22.857
reach your legs, and you feel this cold rise up
your body and then slowly dissipate into this

02:03:22.857 --> 02:03:26.669
little nugget of cold in the center of your chest,
and then vanish.

02:03:26.669 --> 02:03:30.987
ASHLEY: Wait, but doesn't he have protection?

02:03:30.987 --> 02:03:33.105
MARISHA: How about the protection?

02:03:33.105 --> 02:03:35.879
LAURA: He disappears. It disappeared. Maybe it
disappeared forever.

02:03:35.879 --> 02:03:39.896
SAM: Or maybe it's always going to be there,
haunting us.

02:03:39.896 --> 02:03:46.689
LIAM: While he's thinking, I walk up to Delilah,
grab her by the clothes, drag her to the side of

02:03:46.689 --> 02:03:53.935
the wall and prop her up, and turn to Percy. And
say, end this.

02:03:53.935 --> 02:03:55.837
TALIESIN: Cassandra?

02:03:55.837 --> 02:04:06.840
MATT: Cassandra, who has now stopped, looks at
you. She clutches the rapier in her hand, and you

02:04:06.840 --> 02:04:10.469
can see her hand shaking, the tension of the
muscles in her fingers clenching it as hard as she

02:04:10.469 --> 02:04:17.376
possibly can, as she walks up with each slow,
quiet step echoing across the stone. (footsteps)

02:04:17.376 --> 02:04:22.883
Delilah up against the wall, blood spilling out of
the corner of her mouth, (coughs) coughing,

02:04:22.883 --> 02:04:28.622
conscious, with her one missing arm to the side.
Blood's beginning to ooze now from the wound as

02:04:28.622 --> 02:04:33.123
the sheer force of all the movement has torn the
wounds fresh open. And she's there and she looks

02:04:33.123 --> 02:04:38.560
over out of the corner of her eye and turns,
seeing the rest of you, and sees Cassandra. As

02:04:38.560 --> 02:04:42.540
Cassandra steps up, she holds the rapier at her
side, staring down. This time, a single tear

02:04:42.540 --> 02:04:54.437
cresting down the side of her cheek. Delilah looks
up and goes, "You could have been my daughter."

02:04:54.437 --> 02:05:12.549
She looks down at Delilah and says, "No. Cassandra
is a de Rolo, and you took them away from me. And

02:05:12.549 --> 02:05:17.964
"now we're taking everything away from you." And
thrusts the rapier forward, right into the chest.

02:05:17.964 --> 02:05:22.198
As it hits her, it actually pulls her up about a
foot against the wall. The sheer force of the

02:05:22.198 --> 02:05:31.641
wound. (gasps, sighs) Last breath escaping from
Delilah's mouth. Her arm falls limp to the side.

02:05:31.641 --> 02:05:37.401
The moment of tension passes and Cassandra's still
holding her there, her head down, her hair in

02:05:37.401 --> 02:05:40.964
front of her face, just shaking, keeping her
pinned against the wall.

02:05:40.964 --> 02:05:46.916
LAURA: (whispering) Percival.

02:05:46.916 --> 02:05:50.920
TALIESIN: I put my hand on her shoulder and gently
pull her back.

02:05:50.920 --> 02:05:59.790
MATT: The rapier withdraws and the body tumbles to
the ground. She looks back at you, face just a

02:05:59.790 --> 02:06:04.535
mess. "Thank you."

02:06:04.535 --> 02:06:07.262
TALIESIN: We have a lot to do.

02:06:07.262 --> 02:06:20.548
MATT: "We do." And she hands the rapier back to
you, and she grabs the scruff of Delilah's collar

02:06:20.548 --> 02:06:24.179
and begins dragging her up the hallway towards the
castle.

02:06:24.179 --> 02:06:29.707
LAURA: Wait, I meant to loot her earlier and it
didn't happen. Sorry, I just

02:06:29.707 --> 02:06:31.386
really like that part.

02:06:31.386 --> 02:06:39.562
MATT: She drops the body and gives you a look.
"Hurry. If there's one thing I've learned here in

02:06:39.562 --> 02:06:43.172
"Whitestone, it's that things do not stay dead
long."

02:06:43.172 --> 02:06:47.613
LIAM: Seeing as I'm 50 feet ahead of my sister, I
walk ahead of her.

02:06:47.613 --> 02:06:49.365
LAURA: Don't you fucking do this to me.

02:06:49.365 --> 02:06:51.041
LIAM: Is she wearing a cloak?

02:06:51.041 --> 02:07:01.029
MATT: (laughs) Okay. Inspecting the body, you find
a very fine pair of metallic bracers.

02:07:01.029 --> 02:07:03.594
LAURA: (gasps) For archery purposes?

02:07:03.594 --> 02:07:05.448
LIAM: You're not here.

02:07:05.448 --> 02:07:07.515
LAURA: I'm like five feet away from you, at this
point.

02:07:07.515 --> 02:07:10.534
MATT: Her robe, though soaked with blood, is very,
very well-made.

02:07:10.534 --> 02:07:11.870
LIAM: I roll that up.

02:07:11.870 --> 02:07:15.694
MATT: Okay, so you roll up the robe. Her cloak
is--

02:07:15.694 --> 02:07:18.107
LIAM: No, that's what I meant. The cloak. I leave
the robe.

02:07:18.107 --> 02:07:19.396
TALIESIN: No, take everything.

02:07:19.396 --> 02:07:20.576
MARISHA: Take everything.

02:07:20.576 --> 02:07:23.150
LIAM: Yeah. All the fabric. I take it.

02:07:23.150 --> 02:07:26.994
MATT: Okay, you take all the fabric. The robe and
the cloak. So mark those down. The cloak itself

02:07:26.994 --> 02:07:32.415
looked like cloth at a distance. Close up, you can
see it's actually a very fine dark black/purple

02:07:32.415 --> 02:07:39.314
fur, and down at the side of it, you see dangling
these two long tentacles that end in these little

02:07:39.314 --> 02:07:44.957
cupping spiked elements. It looks like it was
carved from a creature at one point.

02:07:44.957 --> 02:07:46.151
LIAM: This is the cloak?

02:07:46.151 --> 02:07:47.016
MATT: The cloak.

02:07:47.016 --> 02:07:48.405
MARISHA: Can I do a nature check to see?

02:07:48.405 --> 02:07:49.490
MATT: Go for it.

02:07:49.490 --> 02:07:50.944
MARISHA: Because I think I know what it is.

02:07:50.944 --> 02:07:54.206
LAURA: I get up in time to smack him upside the
head.

02:07:54.206 --> 02:07:56.281
MARISHA: 29.

02:07:56.281 --> 02:08:00.277
MATT: Yeah, you've actually fought these creatures
before. This is a displacer beast. It's a Cloak of

02:08:00.277 --> 02:08:01.296
Displacement.

02:08:01.296 --> 02:08:04.881
LIAM: I got the cloak and I walk away from it and
leave my sister to go sick on the rest of it.

02:08:04.881 --> 02:08:13.192
LAURA: She's naked. Good job, brother.

02:08:13.192 --> 02:08:15.347
MATT: Yeah, she's mostly nude, other than her
undergarments.

02:08:15.347 --> 02:08:17.184
LIAM: I toss the robe back on her.

02:08:17.184 --> 02:08:20.462
TALIESIN: Vax, Cassandra, let's take her to the
acid pits.

02:08:20.462 --> 02:08:22.217
MATT: The only thing she has left is a ring on her
finger.

02:08:22.217 --> 02:08:23.379
LAURA: What about those bracers you were talking
about?
