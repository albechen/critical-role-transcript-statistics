00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:01.310
Hello everyone and welcome to

2
00:00:01.310 --> 00:00:02.540
tonight's episode of Critical Role

3
00:00:02.540 --> 00:00:03.800
where a bunch of us nerdy-ass voice actors

4
00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:05.588
sit around and play Dungeons &amp; Dragons.

5
00:00:05.588 --> 00:00:09.780
(raucous agreeing noises)

6
00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:10.980
Before we get into tonight's session,

7
00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:12.870
we do have a few announcements to get through,

8
00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:15.290
beginning with the first of our two sponsors,

9
00:00:15.290 --> 00:00:17.500
beginning tonight with Skillshare.

10
00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:19.510
Sam, if you don't mind.

11
00:00:19.510 --> 00:00:21.250
Back this week is Skillshare,

12
00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:23.640

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:43.170
And there's a special on for you Critters,

21
00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:45.340
two month premium membership free--

22
00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:47.400
Free free free
For the first,

23
00:00:48.542 --> 00:00:49.852
for the first 500 people who sign up now

24
00:00:49.852 --> 00:00:54.280
at skl.sh/critcalrole2.

25
00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:55.550
I don't know why, it just is.

26
00:00:55.550 --> 00:00:56.660
But the word two or the number two?

27
00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:58.260
The number two, it's on the screen.

28
00:00:58.260 --> 00:00:59.093
Okay.

29
00:00:59.093 --> 00:01:00.500
Now, I checked out their classes

30
00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:02.560
and I noticed they don't have any classes

31
00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:04.350
on the one skill that I'm best at,

32
00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:07.387
being a corporate shill, so tonight,

33
00:01:07.387 --> 00:01:08.530
(laughing)

34
00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:11.160
tonight, I'd like to offer a class called

35
00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:14.261
Online Advertising 101 with Professor Sam Riegel.

36
00:01:14.261 --> 00:01:16.510
(laughing)

37
00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:18.190
Greetings, class.

38
00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:20.977
In this seminar, I don't know how to hold a pipe,

39
00:01:20.977 --> 00:01:22.120
(laughing)

40
00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:24.010
in this seminar, you'll learn the fundamentals

41
00:01:24.010 --> 00:01:26.800
of satisfying sponsorships of tabletop

42
00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:29.394
RPG streaming shows.
Harry Potter.

43
00:01:29.394 --> 00:01:31.120
(laughing)

44
00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:33.710
There are many ways to do an ad

45
00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:35.060
but to be a shill for your sponsor,

46
00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:37.820
you must master the pinnacles of the form:

47
00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:41.460
raunchy poems, cheap costumes and fake movie scripts

48
00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:44.096
featuring '90s sitcom icon Gale.

49
00:01:44.096 --> 00:01:46.028
Lesson one--
Fake?

50
00:01:46.028 --> 00:01:46.970
(laughing)

51
00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:50.880
When brainstorming, always begin with the MATT system.

52
00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:55.040
That's M-A-T-T, it's a mnemonic, a ma-nom-i-conic.

53
00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:57.290
(laughing)

54
00:01:58.650 --> 00:02:00.920
M stands for music.

55
00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:03.260
Buy a cheap rhyming dictionary

56
00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:05.830
and compose a masterpiece like this one:

57
00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:08.480
pull up a deck chair, pluck out your ear hair,

58
00:02:08.480 --> 00:02:11.118
soil your underwear, Skillshare.

59
00:02:11.118 --> 00:02:11.951
Woo!

60
00:02:11.951 --> 00:02:13.060
(clapping)

61
00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:15.710
That song cost them $700,000.

62
00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:17.960
(laughing)

63
00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:23.060
A of the MATT system stands for accents.

64
00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:25.540
Foreigners love being made fun of.

65
00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:27.340
For beginners, try Italian.

66
00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:28.173
(laughing)

67
00:02:28.173 --> 00:02:30.300
Oh no.
Eh, I'm-a from Italy.

68
00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:32.660
I own a Vespa and eat-a the gelato.

69
00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:34.210
I love-a the Skillshare.

70
00:02:34.210 --> 00:02:35.245
Bon giorno.

71
00:02:35.245 --> 00:02:36.330
(laughing)

72
00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:37.428
Oh.
No.

73
00:02:37.428 --> 00:02:39.638
That was better than a lot of your other accents.

74
00:02:39.638 --> 00:02:41.580
Pretty good.
Video game on the fly.

75
00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:46.160
T of the MATT system stands for, oh shit, uh shit,

76
00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:47.920
all right.
What?

77
00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:48.890
Uh shit.

78
00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:50.360
What?
Are you missing a prop?

79
00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:51.500
I was supposed to have a prop.

80
00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:53.000
A prop of what?
I forgot it.

81
00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.230
Matt, Matt!
You're supposed to

82
00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:57.900
keep going!
I'm just gonna keep going.

83
00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:00.270
I'm just gonna fake it, I'm gonna fake it.

84
00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:03.100
T stands for what?
T stands for terrible food.

85
00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:06.260
When in doubt, just be gross like this,

86
00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:09.390
what was supposed to be a cup of beer and ranch dressing.

87
00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:12.180
Maybe it is.
Oh thank god it's not here.

88
00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:14.280
Skillshare.
That was

89
00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:17.130
so much better, please forget things.

90
00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:20.470
And the last T of the MATT system is time.

91
00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:22.537
People love long advertisements.

92
00:03:22.537 --> 00:03:25.396
(laughing)

93
00:03:25.396 --> 00:03:28.310
The audience tunes in to find out what will happen after

94
00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:30.800
their favorite character tricked a witch with a cupcake

95
00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:34.740
but you, the shill, must stall as long as you can

96
00:03:34.740 --> 00:03:37.750
with ad copy that seems to go on forever, like this one.

97
00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:40.360
Well, that's lesson one.

98
00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:43.240
Future lessons will cover how to piss off

99
00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:46.219
the crew with technical requests, how to,

100
00:03:46.219 --> 00:03:47.782
(laughing)

101
00:03:47.782 --> 00:03:49.130
how to deal with an irate sponsor

102
00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:52.220
who hates your underwear song, and how to make

103
00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:55.400
Laura Bailey regret sitting next to you for two years.

104
00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:56.710
Until then, Skillshare.

105
00:03:57.761 --> 00:03:59.180
(applauding)

106
00:03:59.180 --> 00:04:00.013
Yes.

107
00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:03.400
That was one of the finer--

108
00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:04.590
I didn't get to drink the beer

109
00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:06.380
and the ranch dressing.
Oh no.

110
00:04:07.550 --> 00:04:08.383
We're so sad.

111
00:04:08.383 --> 00:04:09.730
What that woulda looked like?

112
00:04:09.730 --> 00:04:11.778
That was like seeing Little Women again.

113
00:04:11.778 --> 00:04:13.835
(laughing)

114
00:04:13.835 --> 00:04:15.600
There you go.

115
00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:18.580
Thank you, Sam, and thank you, Skillshare.

116
00:04:19.640 --> 00:04:20.540
For your patience.

117
00:04:21.904 --> 00:04:23.530
(laughs) Our second sponsor tonight

118
00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:24.760
are our returning friends for all of

119
00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:27.340
campaign two of Critical Role, D&amp;D Beyond.

120
00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:28.820
D&amp;D Beyond!

121
00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:31.920
An amazing online tool for digitally keeping track

122
00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:33.790
of your campaigns and your D&amp;D characters

123
00:04:33.790 --> 00:04:35.410
and all sorts of rules and content.

124
00:04:35.410 --> 00:04:36.950
They are amazing, if you haven't checked them out,

125
00:04:36.950 --> 00:04:39.680
you can go ahead and do so at dndbeyond,

126
00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:42.110
that's D-N-D beyond.link/criticalrole.

127
00:04:43.787 --> 00:04:46.110
Craft your perfect warlock.
That one.

128
00:04:46.110 --> 00:04:49.248
Thank you, Ashley, for your support on that one.

129
00:04:49.248 --> 00:04:51.473
(laughing)

130
00:04:51.473 --> 00:04:53.293
The spirit movin' ya, it's movin' ya.

131
00:04:53.293 --> 00:04:56.360
Gotta let it move through you.

132
00:04:56.360 --> 00:04:58.032
You gotta let it carry.

133
00:04:58.032 --> 00:05:00.650
(talking over each other)

134
00:05:00.650 --> 00:05:01.483
It is.

135
00:05:01.483 --> 00:05:04.377
It's the lyric and I love that tune even more.

136
00:05:04.377 --> 00:05:05.720
It is.

137
00:05:05.720 --> 00:05:06.553
So,

138
00:05:08.090 --> 00:05:09.580
next up, we announced today,

139
00:05:09.580 --> 00:05:12.790
as part of uploading our new Handbooker Helper

140
00:05:12.790 --> 00:05:15.670
for the Monsterhearts 2 game.

141
00:05:15.670 --> 00:05:17.300
Outta the blue.
Yep, outta the blue.

142
00:05:17.300 --> 00:05:18.133
That's what we do.

143
00:05:18.133 --> 00:05:19.350
For those not familiar, Monsterhearts is

144
00:05:19.350 --> 00:05:22.690
a great game system that deals with kinds the

145
00:05:22.690 --> 00:05:26.380
angsty teenage experience but you're also secretly monsters.

146
00:05:26.380 --> 00:05:28.840
It's really fun, it's a really unique form

147
00:05:28.840 --> 00:05:30.290
of really narrative-heavy roleplaying game.

148
00:05:30.290 --> 00:05:32.500
We put up our new Handbooker Helper about it

149
00:05:32.500 --> 00:05:35.280
and we are doing a Valentine's Day one-shot that'll be

150
00:05:35.280 --> 00:05:37.940

Lookin' forward to it, it's gonna be a lotta fun.

158
00:05:52.670 --> 00:05:55.061
I'm the Master of Ceremonies for it, the MC,

Erika Ishii.
Yeah.

163

And joining, for the first time,

164
00:06:06.920 --> 00:06:08.770
the Critical Role family, our friend Ally Beardsley.

165
00:06:08.770 --> 00:06:10.090
They are an amazing roleplayer you may know

166
00:06:10.090 --> 00:06:12.850
from Dimension 20 as well as CollegeHumor.

167
00:06:12.850 --> 00:06:14.860
They are fantastic and we're so happy to have them aboard,

168
00:06:14.860 --> 00:06:18.420
so check that out next week at 7:00 p.m.

on our Twitch channel here on Critical Role.

170
00:06:21.470 --> 00:06:22.710
Marisha, you have an announcement.

171
00:06:22.710 --> 00:06:26.180
Speakin' of content, if you want more of

172
00:06:26.180 --> 00:06:30.640
Sam aimlessly talking into microphones,

173
00:06:30.640 --> 00:06:34.320
you need to watch All Work No Play, Liam is there too.

174
00:06:34.320 --> 00:06:35.880
We need to take that math course.

175
00:06:35.880 --> 00:06:37.900
Yeah, I do need to take that.

176
00:06:37.900 --> 00:06:41.958
I'm an independent creator, not a corporate shill, so.

177
00:06:41.958 --> 00:06:43.260
(laughing)

178
00:06:43.260 --> 00:06:46.050
Sorry I don't have a polished language.

179
00:06:46.900 --> 00:06:48.097
I produce art.

180
00:06:48.097 --> 00:06:49.410
(laughing)

181
00:06:49.410 --> 00:06:51.510
Like All Work No Play.
Oh!

182
00:06:51.510 --> 00:06:53.750
So yes, the first episode is

183
00:06:53.750 --> 00:06:55.770
available right now on YouTube.

184
00:06:55.770 --> 00:06:57.490
It's Sam and Liam, they have chainsaws?

185
00:06:57.490 --> 00:06:59.640
It's so good!
Shit, it's so funny.

186
00:06:59.640 --> 00:07:01.590
I had the same reaction watching it

187
00:07:01.590 --> 00:07:04.490
that I did with our first, our earliest podcast episodes,

188
00:07:04.490 --> 00:07:06.730
where when we did it, I'm like, "This is not that good."

189
00:07:06.730 --> 00:07:08.485
And then I watch it and I'm like,

190
00:07:08.485 --> 00:07:09.440
"Hey, this is pretty good."

191
00:07:09.440 --> 00:07:10.988
(laughing)

192
00:07:10.988 --> 00:07:14.510
Well, Julie Nathanson really steals the show.

193
00:07:14.510 --> 00:07:16.360
She kinda makes it.
Definitely carries it.

194
00:07:16.360 --> 00:07:18.780
Her muscles, anyway.
Linda Hamilton arms.

195
00:07:18.780 --> 00:07:19.820
Fucking arms, right?
Yeah.

196
00:07:19.820 --> 00:07:21.400
Her in that purple tank top?

197
00:07:21.400 --> 00:07:23.080
Oh my god.
I immediately

198
00:07:23.080 --> 00:07:24.680
started doing push ups.

199
00:07:24.680 --> 00:07:26.686
Oh my god.
While watching the episode.

200
00:07:26.686 --> 00:07:29.743
Sarah Connor level--
Sarah Connor level, yeah.

201
00:07:29.743 --> 00:07:30.910
And then pull ups.
Yeah.

202
00:07:30.910 --> 00:07:34.220
Before I objectify my good friend Julie Nathanson,

203
00:07:35.540 --> 00:07:37.630
yeah, you should catch it right now

204
00:07:37.630 --> 00:07:39.340
and the next episode will air

205
00:07:39.340 --> 00:07:42.120
Tuesday, February 18th at 4:00 p.m.

206
00:07:43.260 --> 00:07:44.093
Ooh.
That's not

207
00:07:44.093 --> 00:07:45.240
this upcoming Tuesday--
Not this Tuesday.

208
00:07:45.240 --> 00:07:46.790
It's the next one.
Next Tuesday.

209
00:07:46.790 --> 00:07:48.454
That's right.
Gotcha.

210
00:07:48.454 --> 00:07:49.287
Cool.
Thanks, Marish.

211
00:07:49.287 --> 00:07:50.780
Was that your Italian accent?

212
00:07:51.870 --> 00:07:52.870
Couldn't you tell?

213
00:07:54.052 --> 00:07:55.370
Oh hello.

214
00:07:55.370 --> 00:07:56.810
(laughing)

215
00:07:56.810 --> 00:07:59.630
Five years later, still fresh off the noggin.

216
00:07:59.630 --> 00:08:00.840
What's goin' on over there?

217
00:08:00.840 --> 00:08:02.470
I'm a little worried about Italy now.

218
00:08:02.470 --> 00:08:04.400
It's like, everybody okay?

219
00:08:05.310 --> 00:08:07.290
I don't know, what sounds so weird?

220
00:08:07.290 --> 00:08:09.008
On next-a Tuesday.

221
00:08:09.008 --> 00:08:10.167
(laughing)

222
00:08:10.167 --> 00:08:11.249
(talking over each other)

223
00:08:11.249 --> 00:08:12.245
All right, movin' on.

224
00:08:12.245 --> 00:08:13.935
(laughing)

225
00:08:13.935 --> 00:08:15.320
Laura, Laura, you've got some announcements, too.

226
00:08:15.320 --> 00:08:16.810
Woo, I do.
Oh man.

227
00:08:16.810 --> 00:08:20.340
First of all, we got new stuff in our stores,

228
00:08:20.340 --> 00:08:22.270
the US shop and the UK shop.

229
00:08:22.270 --> 00:08:25.230
Let's cut to this fabulous--
Cut to?

230
00:08:25.230 --> 00:08:26.063
Oh.
Keychain.

231
00:08:26.063 --> 00:08:27.130
Yeah, I think they've got it on

232
00:08:27.130 --> 00:08:28.310
the table so that you can get a better shot.

233
00:08:28.310 --> 00:08:29.650
Oh, look at that.

234
00:08:29.650 --> 00:08:31.054
(oohing)

235
00:08:31.054 --> 00:08:32.020
I don't know if it's on the, I don't know.

236
00:08:32.020 --> 00:08:34.000
But yeah, it's this beautiful, and it spins.

237
00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:34.833
Yeah, do the demonstration.

238
00:08:34.833 --> 00:08:36.340
Okay, I'm gonna take it, I'm gonna pull it out.

239
00:08:36.340 --> 00:08:37.173
Take it.
Take it.

240
00:08:37.173 --> 00:08:38.580
Cut to the other camera.

241
00:08:38.580 --> 00:08:40.550
There you go.
I'm gonna take it.

242
00:08:40.550 --> 00:08:42.650
Look, ooh.
Okay.

243
00:08:42.650 --> 00:08:44.280
It spins.
Whoa.

244
00:08:46.120 --> 00:08:47.230
Oh, this one isn't--
Spinners, y'all.

245
00:08:47.230 --> 00:08:48.780
Hold on, I'm not doing it very well, there.

246
00:08:48.780 --> 00:08:49.613
You're blocking it with your thumb.

247
00:08:49.613 --> 00:08:50.446
Shut up!

248
00:08:50.446 --> 00:08:54.150
Anyway, it spins and it's got this fabulous copper finish.

249
00:08:54.150 --> 00:08:55.588
Anyway, I like it.

250
00:08:55.588 --> 00:08:57.961
(laughing)

251
00:08:57.961 --> 00:08:59.223
(clapping)

252
00:08:59.223 --> 00:09:00.056
Good sale.
Wow.

253
00:09:00.056 --> 00:09:01.611
There you go, there you go.

254
00:09:01.611 --> 00:09:02.960
There it is.
There we are.

255
00:09:02.960 --> 00:09:06.240
It's copper style.
It's copper sides up.

256
00:09:06.240 --> 00:09:08.800
It's copper.
Do-do do do-do do doo!

257
00:09:09.884 --> 00:09:11.526
(cheering)

258
00:09:11.526 --> 00:09:12.700
Do doo!

259
00:09:12.700 --> 00:09:14.870
This is, wait where's the logo, there it is,

260
00:09:14.870 --> 00:09:19.418
this is called Bailey's Dice Bag of Hoarding.

261
00:09:19.418 --> 00:09:20.506
(laughing)

262
00:09:20.506 --> 00:09:22.060
It's the size of your head.

263
00:09:22.060 --> 00:09:23.850
Dee dee.
It's bigger.

264
00:09:23.850 --> 00:09:26.940
Yeah, so this was a bag that was inspired by

265
00:09:26.940 --> 00:09:29.550
the bags made for several of us.

266
00:09:29.550 --> 00:09:31.110
I don't know if she's made everyone a bag,

267
00:09:31.110 --> 00:09:32.870
but only the ones that she really loves.

268
00:09:32.870 --> 00:09:35.340
Chrissy Ahrens, I hope I'm saying your last name right.

269
00:09:35.340 --> 00:09:40.340
She's on Twitter at @marajade33082 and she's wonderful.

270
00:09:40.780 --> 00:09:42.720
So, she does custom bags and everything, so.

271
00:09:42.720 --> 00:09:44.400
Other people do custom bags as well.

272
00:09:44.400 --> 00:09:45.880
But ours--
Now we do custom bags.

273
00:09:45.880 --> 00:09:47.340
Well, ours is not custom.
Well.

274
00:09:47.340 --> 00:09:49.040
But it's beautiful and it's got

275
00:09:49.040 --> 00:09:50.770
these fabulous lining, anyway.

276
00:09:50.770 --> 00:09:52.980
Oh yeah, the lining is super cute.

277
00:09:52.980 --> 00:09:54.090
With the Wendy doodles.
The Wendy doodles.

278
00:09:54.090 --> 00:09:55.590
In the middle that you can hold it, too.

279
00:09:55.590 --> 00:09:57.160
Yeah, and it's got a wonderful bag,

280
00:09:57.160 --> 00:09:59.360
oh hold on, looka dis.

281
00:09:59.360 --> 00:10:01.370
And it'll hold lots and lotsa dice.

282
00:10:01.370 --> 00:10:04.530
I know 'cause I put everything from my dice bag in here

283
00:10:04.530 --> 00:10:06.746
to make sure--
That looks super durable.

284
00:10:06.746 --> 00:10:08.264
Can I use that for all my hardware needs at home?

285
00:10:08.264 --> 00:10:09.114
Oh, that's right.

286
00:10:09.114 --> 00:10:10.190
(laughing)

287
00:10:10.190 --> 00:10:12.030
Fellas, you could keep nails in there.

288
00:10:12.030 --> 00:10:13.790
It's got a super sturdy bottom, though,

289
00:10:13.790 --> 00:10:16.330
so it won't lose its shape.
Screws and nails.

290
00:10:16.330 --> 00:10:17.420
Anyway, I love it.

291
00:10:17.420 --> 00:10:18.710
(laughing)

292
00:10:18.710 --> 00:10:19.590
Check it out.

293
00:10:19.590 --> 00:10:23.130
And also, for anybody that's going to C2E2,

294
00:10:23.130 --> 00:10:25.430
people have been asking me if our merch is gonna be there

295
00:10:25.430 --> 00:10:27.110
and we are not gonna be selling it personally,

296
00:10:27.110 --> 00:10:31.500
but a lot of our stuff will be at the C2E2 merch booth,

297
00:10:31.500 --> 00:10:33.200
so you can go there and get some--

298
00:10:33.200 --> 00:10:34.720
At the C2E2 merch booth?

299
00:10:34.720 --> 00:10:36.060
Did I say that right?
Yeah.

300
00:10:36.060 --> 00:10:36.910
Is that right?
Yeah.

301
00:10:36.910 --> 00:10:38.430
It's at the C2E2 merch booth.
Okay.

302
00:10:38.430 --> 00:10:40.030
Actual convention merch.
Yeah.

303
00:10:40.030 --> 00:10:41.650
You instill Laura--
No, I just didn't--

304
00:10:41.650 --> 00:10:43.380
Insecurity on camera.
Yeah, it's pretty cool.

305
00:10:43.380 --> 00:10:44.670
There's a merch booth there? Cool.

306
00:10:44.670 --> 00:10:46.220
Yeah, they sell the con stuff,

307
00:10:46.220 --> 00:10:47.920
but they are also gonna sell our stuff.

308
00:10:47.920 --> 00:10:50.223
Have their big booth where you can go--

309
00:10:50.223 --> 00:10:51.220
(talking over each other)

310
00:10:51.220 --> 00:10:52.890
Shut up.
I don't know things.

311
00:10:52.890 --> 00:10:54.890
I've got a layer--
I'm debating.

312
00:10:54.890 --> 00:10:56.890
I don't know whether to keep it in my custom bag

313
00:10:56.890 --> 00:11:00.350
or pour some in, maybe I'll just put the ones that are

314
00:11:00.350 --> 00:11:02.870
in my other bag in this one.
You have plenty.

315
00:11:02.870 --> 00:11:04.870
You can smaller dice bags--
Did you hear that?

316
00:11:04.870 --> 00:11:05.820
To put--
Someone beside me,

317
00:11:05.820 --> 00:11:08.230
speaking truth, slingin' it.
What'd you say, Marisha?

318
00:11:08.230 --> 00:11:09.220
You don't have to fill it up.

319
00:11:09.220 --> 00:11:11.020
Nothin', I didn't say anything, it was Travis.

320
00:11:11.020 --> 00:11:12.243
Travis said everything.

321
00:11:12.243 --> 00:11:13.076
(snorting)

322
00:11:13.076 --> 00:11:13.909
It was Travis.

323
00:11:13.909 --> 00:11:14.742
Hide quickly, the laser beams.

324
00:11:14.742 --> 00:11:16.240
Matt, I think it's back to you, brother.

325
00:11:16.240 --> 00:11:17.790
I think it might be.

326
00:11:18.980 --> 00:11:21.380
Thank you, Laura.
Thank you, Matt.

327
00:11:21.380 --> 00:11:24.250
And I believe that marks the end

328
00:11:24.250 --> 00:11:27.250
of all of our announcements and as such,

329
00:11:27.250 --> 00:11:28.330
let's go ahead and jump into

(flames whooshing)

369
00:13:09.908 --> 00:13:11.852
You guys were so late on the draw that time.

370
00:13:11.852 --> 00:13:13.531
(groaning)
(blowing raspberries)

371
00:13:13.531 --> 00:13:15.213
Welcome back.

372
00:13:15.213 --> 00:13:18.780
So, last we left off,

373
00:13:18.780 --> 00:13:23.500
the Mighty Nein, in discovering that the curse

374
00:13:23.500 --> 00:13:27.460
that still holds Nott in her goblinoid form

375
00:13:27.460 --> 00:13:30.670
after her initial transformation years ago remained

376
00:13:30.670 --> 00:13:35.520
and apparently was still held by the same magical woman

377
00:13:35.520 --> 00:13:38.480
that had originally imposed this curse upon her.

378
00:13:38.480 --> 00:13:40.270
You traveled your way through Kamordah,

379
00:13:41.248 --> 00:13:45.690
had a tense experience meeting the Lionett family,

380
00:13:45.690 --> 00:13:48.660
who also has attachments to this entity

381
00:13:48.660 --> 00:13:51.970
you came to discover was named as Isharnai the Prism Sage,

382
00:13:51.970 --> 00:13:55.740
who lived to the Northern forest marshlands

383
00:13:55.740 --> 00:13:58.970
amongst the bases around Mount Mentiri.

384
00:13:59.980 --> 00:14:02.880
You traversed this dangerous landscape,

385
00:14:04.216 --> 00:14:09.216
dealing with various pockets of unleashed acidic moisture

386
00:14:09.360 --> 00:14:14.360
and steam bursting forth from the geothermal ground itself.

387
00:14:15.170 --> 00:14:18.620
You lost a few horses and let the others wander.

388
00:14:18.620 --> 00:14:19.560
You made your way through swamps

389
00:14:19.560 --> 00:14:21.820
and got lost, got exhausted,

390
00:14:21.820 --> 00:14:24.140
dealt with fighting a few gorefeather harpies,

391
00:14:24.140 --> 00:14:25.270
and then eventually found your way

392
00:14:25.270 --> 00:14:27.810
to the base of Mount Mentiri, to the exterior

393
00:14:27.810 --> 00:14:31.090
of the abode of Isharnai just as the sun set.

394
00:14:32.230 --> 00:14:35.240
Upon looking around, you eventually discovered

395
00:14:35.240 --> 00:14:37.690
this creature invisible on the roof

396
00:14:37.690 --> 00:14:39.830
watching you all as you were

397
00:14:39.830 --> 00:14:42.600
just investigating her homestead,

398
00:14:43.720 --> 00:14:45.450
after which you had some conversations with her,

399
00:14:45.450 --> 00:14:49.590
discovered that she could offer many things,

400
00:14:49.590 --> 00:14:51.280
just like she has in the past,

401
00:14:51.280 --> 00:14:53.930
in exchange for a touch of your own fortune.

402
00:14:53.930 --> 00:14:55.660
Seemed to have thrive on misery

403
00:14:55.660 --> 00:14:58.050
for those who asked for too much.

404
00:14:58.050 --> 00:15:02.650
And, after some very emotional conversations

405
00:15:02.650 --> 00:15:06.530
and thoughts about what some of you are willing to sacrifice

406
00:15:07.530 --> 00:15:10.130
to trade for this curse that still remained on Nott,

407
00:15:11.870 --> 00:15:12.703
Jester

408
00:15:13.600 --> 00:15:14.480
bamboozled

409
00:15:15.760 --> 00:15:17.488
her--
Bamboozled.

410
00:15:17.488 --> 00:15:19.540
And me,

411
00:15:19.540 --> 00:15:23.130
through a clutch combination of dust and deliciousness,

412
00:15:23.130 --> 00:15:24.310
a random magical item I made up

413
00:15:24.310 --> 00:15:26.000
and gave you back in episode 30

414
00:15:27.002 --> 00:15:27.835
(laughing)

415
00:15:27.835 --> 00:15:30.820
and used it to modify the memory of her,

416
00:15:30.820 --> 00:15:33.980
to convince this crone-type creature

417
00:15:33.980 --> 00:15:35.190
that she had such an amazing time

418
00:15:35.190 --> 00:15:38.740
and you guys bonded so quickly and in this time,

419
00:15:38.740 --> 00:15:42.690
she just was happy to release it for your companionship.

420
00:15:42.690 --> 00:15:45.750
And you left, walked outside into the dark night

421
00:15:45.750 --> 00:15:48.630
as you were all tired and wondering what happened,

422
00:15:48.630 --> 00:15:51.240
to have Jester go, "Go, we have to go, now."

423
00:15:52.320 --> 00:15:54.270
So, as you all were quickly ushered off

424
00:15:55.390 --> 00:15:58.020
this somewhat moss-covered darkened hut,

425
00:15:58.020 --> 00:16:00.700
the dull interior candlelit glow

426
00:16:00.700 --> 00:16:04.160
that pours through the partially ajar doorway,

427
00:16:04.160 --> 00:16:08.230
you all spearhead downward, back into the swampy valley

428
00:16:08.230 --> 00:16:11.410
that awaits you as night has just begun.

429
00:16:11.410 --> 00:16:14.190
And that is where we left off.

430
00:16:15.430 --> 00:16:17.400 line:15%
So, as Jester is quickly ushering you

431
00:16:17.400 --> 00:16:19.370 line:15%
down into the darkness, what do you do?

432
00:16:19.370 --> 00:16:20.650 line:15%
Quick, quickly.
Why are we--

433
00:16:20.650 --> 00:16:23.553 line:15%
Cast Find the Path.
Oh.

434
00:16:23.553 --> 00:16:24.460 line:15%
(laughing)

435
00:16:24.460 --> 00:16:25.510 line:15%
I don't have that prepared.

436
00:16:25.510 --> 00:16:27.008 line:15%
Okay, great.
Okay.

437
00:16:27.008 --> 00:16:28.123 line:15%
What's Find the Path?

438
00:16:28.123 --> 00:16:30.090 line:15%
It's a spell so I can find a path.

439
00:16:31.309 --> 00:16:32.610 line:15%
But I thought, you know, she'd be dead and we

440
00:16:32.610 --> 00:16:36.140 line:15%
wouldn't have to be hurrying or anything like that, so.

441
00:16:36.140 --> 00:16:39.200 line:15%
Caleb, Caleb, just teleport us away from here.

442
00:16:39.200 --> 00:16:43.300 line:15%
Oh, I, uh, oh.
What happened, though?

443
00:16:43.300 --> 00:16:44.490 line:15%
What happened?
Whatta you mean, "Oh"?

444
00:16:44.490 --> 00:16:45.860 line:15%
You are saying this as we're walking,

445
00:16:45.860 --> 00:16:47.690 line:15%
right, we're going through the brambles now.

446
00:16:47.690 --> 00:16:49.690 line:15%
Hang on now 'cause wait, though, what?

447
00:16:51.359 --> 00:16:52.608 line:15%
Wait though what?
Oh yeah.

448
00:16:52.608 --> 00:16:53.579 line:15%
What happened?
Don't we need

449
00:16:53.579 --> 00:16:54.412 line:15%
to do something--
Are we okay?

450
00:16:54.412 --> 00:16:55.615 line:15%
Kill her or anything?
What happened?

451
00:16:55.615 --> 00:16:57.100 line:15%
Everything's fine.
Did you give up something?

452
00:16:58.100 --> 00:17:01.623 line:15%
Something, yeah, like the real sprecial.

453
00:17:01.623 --> 00:17:04.425 line:15%
(snorting)

454
00:17:04.425 --> 00:17:05.419 line:15%
A real sprecial?
Yeah, it's a real sprecial.

455
00:17:05.419 --> 00:17:07.051 line:15%
What's a sprecial?
It's like--

456
00:17:07.051 --> 00:17:10.530 line:15%
Sprinkle's name.
It's an Indian dish.

457
00:17:10.530 --> 00:17:11.600 line:15%
Shpretzies are the best.

458
00:17:11.600 --> 00:17:13.590 line:15%
You made shpretzle outta Sprinkle?

459
00:17:13.590 --> 00:17:16.140 line:15%
No, Sprinkle's fine, look.
Oh.

460
00:17:16.140 --> 00:17:18.725 line:15%
What's a sprecial?
Kick ass.

461
00:17:18.725 --> 00:17:20.147 line:15%
(giggling)

462
00:17:20.147 --> 00:17:21.563 line:15%
(sighing)

463
00:17:21.563 --> 00:17:23.934 line:15%
He has no hair, Jester.
What?

464
00:17:23.934 --> 00:17:25.260 line:15%
I wanna just get some food out

465
00:17:25.260 --> 00:17:28.398 line:15%
and just feed Sprinkle as we talk.

466
00:17:28.398 --> 00:17:30.660 line:15%
(wheezing laughter)

467
00:17:30.660 --> 00:17:32.690 line:15%
He's eating, it's, he's fine.

468
00:17:34.134 --> 00:17:34.967 line:15%
(gagging)

469
00:17:34.967 --> 00:17:35.960 line:15%
It's like beef jerky, it's fine.

470
00:17:36.898 --> 00:17:38.000 line:15%
Peanut allergy.
So dry.

471
00:17:39.038 --> 00:17:40.031 line:15%
It won't go down.

472
00:17:40.031 --> 00:17:41.582 line:15%
(gagging)

473
00:17:41.582 --> 00:17:42.856 line:15%
This is a show about a weasel.

474
00:17:42.856 --> 00:17:45.106 line:15%
(laughing)

475
00:17:45.960 --> 00:17:47.040 line:15%
Wait, are we in danger?

476
00:17:47.040 --> 00:17:48.320 line:15%
Do we need to run?

477
00:17:48.320 --> 00:17:50.720 line:15%
We are moving at pace, aren't we?

478
00:17:50.720 --> 00:17:51.850 line:15%
Yeah, we are moving at pace.
You are.

479
00:17:51.850 --> 00:17:56.630 line:15%
I maybe, I just would, I'd rather not say this right now.

480
00:17:56.630 --> 00:17:58.620 line:15%
Like, you know, I gave away something

481
00:17:58.620 --> 00:18:00.880 line:15%
really special and shit's fine, it's fine.

482
00:18:00.880 --> 00:18:03.743 line:15%
We should just go because I don't want to, like--

483
00:18:03.743 --> 00:18:04.576 line:15%
(whispering)

484
00:18:04.576 --> 00:18:05.409 line:15%
Is Nott good, though?

485
00:18:05.409 --> 00:18:06.490 line:15%
Yeah, are we taken care of here, or--

486
00:18:06.490 --> 00:18:07.940 line:15%
Yeah, yeah, everything's fine.

487
00:18:07.940 --> 00:18:10.440 line:15%
Nott, your curse is broken.
Is my brother good?

488
00:18:11.300 --> 00:18:12.710 line:15%
Whatta you mean?

489
00:18:12.710 --> 00:18:15.500 line:15%
She said she, she, what did--
I don't know,

490
00:18:15.500 --> 00:18:17.209 line:15%
I had some questions.
You didn't make a deal,

491
00:18:17.209 --> 00:18:18.460 line:15%
did you?
No.

492
00:18:18.460 --> 00:18:20.420 line:15%
Then your brother's fine.

493
00:18:20.420 --> 00:18:21.590 line:15%
Well.
Right?

494
00:18:23.093 --> 00:18:24.070 line:15%
What, whatta you mean?

495
00:18:24.070 --> 00:18:25.050 line:15%
What d'you mean your brother?

496
00:18:25.050 --> 00:18:27.610 line:15%
No, just keep goin'.
Okay, so we need to go.

497
00:18:27.610 --> 00:18:30.170 line:15%
It's fine, Nott is good.
Go, get walking.

498
00:18:30.170 --> 00:18:34.330 line:15%
And Caleb, you said oh earlier to the teleport request?

499
00:18:34.330 --> 00:18:36.680 line:15%
No, I did not, I do not have that ready.

500
00:18:36.680 --> 00:18:38.370 line:15%
Wait, oh.

501
00:18:38.370 --> 00:18:40.000 line:15%
Okay, oh.
Who can, can you,

502
00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:40.990 line:15%
do you have Find a Path,

503
00:18:40.990 --> 00:18:43.280 line:15%
can you find us a path?
No, I can definitely--

504
00:18:43.280 --> 00:18:44.860 line:15%
I thought you found the path before.

505
00:18:44.860 --> 00:18:47.800 line:15%
I did but, you know, I kinda prepare some spells at

506
00:18:47.800 --> 00:18:50.380 line:15%
the beginning of the day and I didn't prepare that one.

507
00:18:50.380 --> 00:18:52.010 line:15%
Keep an eye on things behind us.

508
00:18:52.010 --> 00:18:53.870 line:15%
Yeah, so I'm gonna look behind us.

509
00:18:53.870 --> 00:18:56.110 line:15%
Because I thought we would be fighting and so, I made,

510
00:18:56.110 --> 00:18:59.081 line:15%
I prepared, like, a heal spell instead.

511
00:18:59.081 --> 00:19:00.350 line:15%
'Cause, you know, I heal.
22.

512
00:19:00.350 --> 00:19:02.150 line:15%
We have a certain way of doing things.

513
00:19:02.150 --> 00:19:03.990 line:15%
Normally we raze things to the ground,

514
00:19:03.990 --> 00:19:07.560 line:15%
so I did not think that we would need to escape in a hurry.

515
00:19:07.560 --> 00:19:09.540 line:15%
Yup, no, that's true.
So.

516
00:19:09.540 --> 00:19:10.980 line:15%
Yup.
I came prepared

517
00:19:10.980 --> 00:19:13.800 line:15%
to fuck shit up, but I cannot get us out.

518
00:19:13.800 --> 00:19:14.820 line:15%
Yeah.
Yeah, you know,

519
00:19:14.820 --> 00:19:17.570 line:15%
act as if, basically, we just walk like,

520
00:19:17.570 --> 00:19:20.280 line:15%
you know, you traded something that she loved--

521
00:19:20.280 --> 00:19:21.760 line:15%
I did.
And Nott's fine

522
00:19:21.760 --> 00:19:23.450 line:15%
and we're gonna make our way out of here like we did before.

523
00:19:23.450 --> 00:19:26.420 line:15%
Yeah, we're walking away confidently and happily

524
00:19:26.420 --> 00:19:28.220 line:15%
and knowing that--
The deal is closed.

525
00:19:28.220 --> 00:19:30.509 line:15%
Why do we need to rush, though?

526
00:19:30.509 --> 00:19:32.318 line:15%
Well, uh--

527
00:19:32.318 --> 00:19:33.660 line:15%
(hooting)

528
00:19:33.660 --> 00:19:36.310 line:15%
You hear the nocturnal creatures are starting to come out.

529
00:19:36.310 --> 00:19:39.990 line:15%
The night has definitely claimed the dense forest

530
00:19:39.990 --> 00:19:42.260 line:15%
as you guys feel the ground beneath you at this point

531
00:19:42.260 --> 00:19:43.940 line:15%
beginning to turn a little softer,

532
00:19:43.940 --> 00:19:46.310 line:15%
then the moisture of the swamp approaching.

533
00:19:46.310 --> 00:19:48.220 line:15%
You do not see anything immediately behind you

534
00:19:48.220 --> 00:19:50.050 line:15%
beyond just the occasional dark shadow

535
00:19:50.050 --> 00:19:52.940 line:15%
of some sort of nocturnal flight bird or predator

536
00:19:52.940 --> 00:19:55.550 line:15%
finding its way out for an early evening bite.

537
00:19:55.550 --> 00:19:58.930 line:15%
I just, the thing that I gave her, you know,

538
00:19:58.930 --> 00:20:03.480 line:15%
I've never actually given before or used, so--

539
00:20:03.480 --> 00:20:04.410 line:15%
What did you give her?

540
00:20:04.410 --> 00:20:06.220 line:15%
I gave her--
Did you kiss her?

541
00:20:07.460 --> 00:20:09.450 line:15%
Yeah, I gave her a real big smooch

542
00:20:09.450 --> 00:20:11.560 line:15%
and she loved it, she was like, "Oh my god."

543
00:20:11.560 --> 00:20:13.122 line:15%
We don't believe you, Jester.

544
00:20:13.122 --> 00:20:13.955 line:15%
Will you tell us what you gave her, please?

545
00:20:13.955 --> 00:20:15.390 line:15%
I hadn't even gotten to that.

546
00:20:15.390 --> 00:20:16.540 line:15%
I gave her a cupcake.

547
00:20:17.460 --> 00:20:18.410 line:15%
My last one, I gave her my last--

548
00:20:18.410 --> 00:20:19.243 line:15%
What did you really give her?

549
00:20:19.243 --> 00:20:20.710 line:15%
I gave her a cupcake.
And that, then that--

550
00:20:20.710 --> 00:20:21.980 line:15%
That was enough?
Was enough.

551
00:20:21.980 --> 00:20:23.810 line:15%
Yup, yeah.
How could a cupcake

552
00:20:23.810 --> 00:20:26.290 line:15%
possibly be enough?
I don't feel any different.

553
00:20:26.290 --> 00:20:27.123 line:15%
You're telling me that--

554
00:20:27.123 --> 00:20:28.740 line:15%
Nott was prepared to give war.

555
00:20:28.740 --> 00:20:29.573 line:15%
The curse has been lifted on me.

556
00:20:29.573 --> 00:20:30.480 line:15%
Nott--
Do I look different?

557
00:20:30.480 --> 00:20:33.300 line:15%
I was in the room and the whole room went dark

558
00:20:33.300 --> 00:20:36.670 line:15%
and she waved her hand and she said the curse was broken.

559
00:20:38.500 --> 00:20:39.820 line:15%
The whole room went really, like,

560
00:20:39.820 --> 00:20:41.670 line:15%
magically dark, you know what I mean?

561
00:20:43.380 --> 00:20:46.090 line:15%
And I believed her.
You believe her?

562
00:20:46.090 --> 00:20:46.923 line:15%
Yeah.

563
00:20:48.210 --> 00:20:49.990 line:15%
Yeah.
Well, thank you.

564
00:20:49.990 --> 00:20:52.390 line:15%
Well, I suppose if it's not true,

565
00:20:52.390 --> 00:20:53.790 line:15%
we could always double back?

566
00:20:54.830 --> 00:20:56.680 line:15%
What?
That's fair.

567
00:20:56.680 --> 00:20:58.250 line:15%
Why don't we just make the hut or something--

568
00:20:58.250 --> 00:20:59.730 line:15%
Oh, finish the job?
Yeah.

569
00:20:59.730 --> 00:21:00.830 line:15%
It doesn't seem like a deal

570
00:21:00.830 --> 00:21:02.530 line:15%
would be concluded with a cupcake.

571
00:21:02.530 --> 00:21:05.760 line:15%
Maybe we should take care of this ourselves.

572
00:21:05.760 --> 00:21:10.110 line:15%
Well, let's, let's--
You don't trust me?

573
00:21:10.110 --> 00:21:11.230 line:15%
I trust you.
No, I trust you,

574
00:21:11.230 --> 00:21:13.320 line:15%
I just don't believe--
You just don't believe me?

575
00:21:13.320 --> 00:21:15.710 line:15%
You don't believe me that I would know the difference

576
00:21:15.710 --> 00:21:18.110 line:15%
if a curse was broken and a deal was made?

577
00:21:18.110 --> 00:21:20.080 line:15%
How would she break a curse that's been

578
00:21:20.080 --> 00:21:23.130 line:15%
hanging over Nott for years over a cupcake?

579
00:21:23.130 --> 00:21:25.880 line:15%
What flavor was the cupcake?
It was blueberry.

580
00:21:26.800 --> 00:21:29.077 line:15%
I mean, I'll do a lot for a blueberry

581
00:21:29.077 --> 00:21:29.910 line:15%
cupcake.
Okay.

582
00:21:29.910 --> 00:21:31.650 line:15%
It's been a minute since you've gotten any new cupcakes.

583
00:21:31.650 --> 00:21:35.720 line:15%
How old was that cupcake?
It was pretty old.

584
00:21:35.720 --> 00:21:36.790 line:15%
(laughing)

585
00:21:36.790 --> 00:21:37.623 line:15%
What are we missing?

586
00:21:37.623 --> 00:21:41.200 line:15%
The frosting was, like, real stale.

587
00:21:41.200 --> 00:21:42.630 line:15%
I tasted it.
To be fair,

588
00:21:42.630 --> 00:21:45.080 line:15%
she probably eats, like, you know, earthworms and--

589
00:21:45.080 --> 00:21:47.070 line:15%
Exactly.
Fungus and stuff, so--

590
00:21:47.070 --> 00:21:48.880 line:15%
This is all very confusing.
Plus it had

591
00:21:48.880 --> 00:21:51.470 line:15%
some of that stuff that Pumat gave us.

592
00:21:51.470 --> 00:21:53.400 line:15%
We need to get somewhere safe so we can talk this out.

593
00:21:53.400 --> 00:21:54.860 line:15%
Wait, what was that last part?

594
00:21:54.860 --> 00:21:57.330 line:15%
Um, you know that stuff?
No.

595
00:21:57.330 --> 00:22:01.100 line:15%
The dust that we, that remember, we talked about and makes

596
00:22:01.100 --> 00:22:02.749 line:15%
food taste really good.
Oh.

597
00:22:02.749 --> 00:22:03.810 line:15%
Oh that, oh that.
Yeah.

598
00:22:03.810 --> 00:22:05.990 line:15%
Oh that, oh.
Mmhm.

599
00:22:05.990 --> 00:22:07.505 line:15%
Oh.
What about it?

600
00:22:07.505 --> 00:22:09.400 line:15%
So, it made it taste good.

601
00:22:09.400 --> 00:22:10.570 line:15%
We have--
Pretty damn good.

602
00:22:10.570 --> 00:22:12.045 line:15%
Can I look behind us?

603
00:22:12.045 --> 00:22:13.660 line:15%
Is anything following us?
Make a perception check.

604
00:22:13.660 --> 00:22:16.418 line:15%
I'll join you, I'm just gonna keep doing this.

605
00:22:16.418 --> 00:22:17.380 line:15%
I don't care, I'm gonna look any way I can.

606
00:22:17.380 --> 00:22:18.400 line:15%
27.
Ooh,

607
00:22:18.400 --> 00:22:19.900 line:15%
you saw way more than me.

608
00:22:19.900 --> 00:22:21.020 line:15%
17.
17.

609
00:22:22.390 --> 00:22:23.440 line:15%
For the time being, no.

610
00:22:23.440 --> 00:22:25.660 line:15%
You don't notice anything behind you.

611
00:22:25.660 --> 00:22:29.420 line:15%
The air is cold and the mist is rising in the swamp

612
00:22:29.420 --> 00:22:31.040 line:15%
as you guys begin to now hit

613
00:22:31.040 --> 00:22:33.450 line:15%
the elements of the mud and water

614
00:22:33.450 --> 00:22:36.027 line:15%
that you're now ankle deep and you can hear the--

615
00:22:36.027 --> 00:22:37.176 line:15%
(squelching)

616
00:22:37.176 --> 00:22:38.130 line:15%
You guys, this is probably dangerous

617
00:22:38.130 --> 00:22:42.360 line:15%
to traverse in the night.
Should we go in the hut

618
00:22:42.360 --> 00:22:44.580 line:15%
and just sort of camouflage ourselves?

619
00:22:44.580 --> 00:22:46.300 line:15%
Well, it's soggy.
Maybe.

620
00:22:46.300 --> 00:22:47.770 line:15%
I don't really know if there's--

621
00:22:47.770 --> 00:22:50.040 line:15%
Well, why don't we find solid ground first?

622
00:22:51.130 --> 00:22:52.520 line:15%
Let's find somewhere to put the hut,

623
00:22:52.520 --> 00:22:53.710 line:15%
maybe off the beaten track

624
00:22:53.710 --> 00:22:56.613 line:15%
Whatta you need to do the ritual for Nott?

625
00:22:56.613 --> 00:22:58.700 line:15%
Oh, uh, oh boy.

626
00:22:58.700 --> 00:23:00.507 line:15%
It has been a week, you guys.

627
00:23:00.507 --> 00:23:01.340 line:15%
Do you have stuff?

628
00:23:01.340 --> 00:23:02.320 line:15%
Do we need to start collecting clay?

629
00:23:02.320 --> 00:23:04.090 line:15%
Uh, yeah.
Wait, not that ritual.

630
00:23:04.090 --> 00:23:05.470 line:15%
No, no, no, no.
She is

631
00:23:05.470 --> 00:23:07.080 line:15%
talking about Nott's ritual, but--

632
00:23:07.080 --> 00:23:09.060 line:15%
No, let's, that takes, like, an hour.

633
00:23:09.060 --> 00:23:10.800 line:15%
We do that at home, I think.
Yeah.

634
00:23:10.800 --> 00:23:11.810 line:15%
Right?
Let's make the hut.

635
00:23:11.810 --> 00:23:13.699 line:15%
Not while we're running, no.

636
00:23:13.699 --> 00:23:15.500 line:15%
What if it's not broken?
Well, we can come back.

637
00:23:15.500 --> 00:23:17.730 line:15%
It's broken.
How,though?

638
00:23:19.434 --> 00:23:21.590 line:15%
I'll tell you if we get the hut up, okay?

639
00:23:21.590 --> 00:23:23.360 line:15%
I'll talk to you guys in the hut, Beau.

640
00:23:23.360 --> 00:23:26.270 line:15%
Well, let's a bit of dry ground if we're able to.

641
00:23:26.270 --> 00:23:28.090 line:15%
Sure, yeah, okay.
10 to 15 feet.

642
00:23:28.090 --> 00:23:30.290 line:15%
For solid ground?
Make a survival check.

643
00:23:30.290 --> 00:23:31.123 line:15%
Survival.

644
00:23:33.170 --> 00:23:34.850 line:15%
You're a survivor
Just me?

645
00:23:34.850 --> 00:23:38.050 line:15%
Did anybody gimme guidance?

646
00:23:39.460 --> 00:23:41.560 line:15%
Any advantage 'cause people are also, ooh.

647
00:23:42.790 --> 00:23:45.180 line:15%
20,

648
00:23:45.180 --> 00:23:49.030 line:15%
what is that, 23 plus a D4.

649
00:23:49.030 --> 00:23:51.970 line:15%
Damn, Jester.
26.

650
00:23:51.970 --> 00:23:54.170 line:15%
26, okay.
That was one hell of a roll.

651
00:23:54.170 --> 00:23:59.170 line:15%
All right, you go ahead and it takes you about an hour

652
00:23:59.330 --> 00:24:01.380 line:15%
'cause you either have to get really far off the beaten path

653
00:24:01.380 --> 00:24:02.920 line:15%
or you have to push forward and you're like,

654
00:24:02.920 --> 00:24:06.200 line:15%
going forward, there's a chance you might find,

655
00:24:06.200 --> 00:24:08.470 line:15%
it's easier to find things that break the surface when

656
00:24:08.470 --> 00:24:12.358 line:15%
it's not as shallow, but also, you're off the beaten path

657
00:24:12.358 --> 00:24:14.020 line:15%
and you know where you've traveled and the safest

658
00:24:14.020 --> 00:24:16.180 line:15%
or at least the most immediate distance

659
00:24:16.180 --> 00:24:17.690 line:15%
between where you are and where you're going.

660
00:24:17.690 --> 00:24:19.040 line:15%
Okay.
It takes about an hour

661
00:24:19.040 --> 00:24:20.730 line:15%
before you find a patch of land that is

662
00:24:20.730 --> 00:24:25.080 line:15%
mostly above water and can probably fit the dome in it.

663
00:24:25.080 --> 00:24:27.860 line:15%
There is one issue is a quarter of it would be

664
00:24:27.860 --> 00:24:30.780 line:15%
filled with part of a fallen rotted trunk of a tree,

665
00:24:32.280 --> 00:24:33.113 line:15%
which means you'll have to be

666
00:24:33.113 --> 00:24:35.680 line:15%
pretty tight in there when you sleep, but it's doable.

667
00:24:35.680 --> 00:24:37.119 line:15%
We'll squish in.
So like,

668
00:24:37.119 --> 00:24:37.952 line:15%
the dome would be around the tree trunk?

669
00:24:37.952 --> 00:24:39.370 line:15%
Yes.
That's fine.

670
00:24:39.370 --> 00:24:40.300 line:15%
Unless one of you wanna sleep

671
00:24:40.300 --> 00:24:41.133 line:15%
in the water.
Nope.

672
00:24:41.133 --> 00:24:42.500 line:15%
Hollowed out tree trunk or solid?

673
00:24:44.840 --> 00:24:47.180 line:15%
Is it a fun straw into our home?

674
00:24:47.180 --> 00:24:49.520 line:15%
No, 'cause the dome would go through the hut,

675
00:24:49.520 --> 00:24:51.270 line:15%
right, go through the trunk anyway.

676
00:24:53.936 --> 00:24:55.640 line:15%
The trunk would be inside the dome

677
00:24:55.640 --> 00:24:58.770 line:15%
as far as getting enough ground that itself is open

678
00:24:58.770 --> 00:25:02.340 line:15%
and not under water and under the actual

679
00:25:02.340 --> 00:25:05.720 line:15%
marsh water, but it is not hollow

680
00:25:07.081 --> 00:25:07.931 line:15%
and it is rotted.

681
00:25:08.890 --> 00:25:10.160 line:15%
You go to inspect it and you pull it

682
00:25:10.160 --> 00:25:12.349 line:15%
and the hard, the jagged parts are just

683
00:25:12.349 --> 00:25:13.500 line:15%
(imitates breaking noises) peel off softly.

684
00:25:13.500 --> 00:25:16.500 line:15%
Can we just move the trunk?
It's rooted in the ground.

685
00:25:16.500 --> 00:25:17.360 line:15%
You can try and move it up if you

686
00:25:17.360 --> 00:25:18.660 line:15%
wanna try and tear the trunk out.

687
00:25:18.660 --> 00:25:19.510 line:15%
Just sleep around it.

688
00:25:19.510 --> 00:25:21.460 line:15%
It'll be uncomfortable but safe.

689
00:25:21.460 --> 00:25:22.810 line:15%
Okay.
How long does it take

690
00:25:22.810 --> 00:25:24.800 line:15%
for you to cast it as a ritual?

691
00:25:24.800 --> 00:25:27.784 line:15%
11 minutes as a ritual.
11 minutes as a ritual?

692
00:25:27.784 --> 00:25:29.510 line:15%
Should we try and push the trunk for 11 minutes?

693
00:25:29.510 --> 00:25:31.850 line:15%
Yeah, for 11 minutes, we'll try to move it.

694
00:25:31.850 --> 00:25:33.980 line:15%
Okay, go ahead and make a, who's helming this?

695
00:25:33.980 --> 00:25:35.870 line:15%
I help the girls.
Oh, the girls are doin' it?

696
00:25:35.870 --> 00:25:37.448 line:15%
Yeah.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

697
00:25:37.448 --> 00:25:38.487 line:15%
You two are strength-based.

698
00:25:38.487 --> 00:25:39.920 line:15%
Yeah, so both you guys make strength checks, right.

699
00:25:39.920 --> 00:25:41.740 line:15%
Okay.
And I am

700
00:25:41.740 --> 00:25:44.020 line:15%
there for emotional support.
I'm watching,

701
00:25:44.020 --> 00:25:46.980 line:15%
I'm watching for anything--
Natural 20.

702
00:25:46.980 --> 00:25:48.740 line:15%
Oh shit.
Whoa!

703
00:25:48.740 --> 00:25:51.680 line:15%
And I got a 27.
Whoo!

704
00:25:53.180 --> 00:25:54.013 line:15%
Wow.
Damn.

705
00:25:55.080 --> 00:25:57.630 line:15%
20 on perception, too, just keeping an eye on--

706
00:25:57.630 --> 00:25:59.780 line:15%
Fair enough.
She's the splinter maker.

707
00:26:01.033 --> 00:26:03.520 line:15%
As Jester and Yasha

708
00:26:03.520 --> 00:26:06.150 line:15%
reach, both kind of getting their fingers into the ground,

709
00:26:06.150 --> 00:26:08.840 line:15%
and it's easy to get a grip because the soft earth

710
00:26:08.840 --> 00:26:10.740 line:15%
gives away to your fingers as you push

711
00:26:10.740 --> 00:26:14.510 line:15%
and find a heavy handhold on these deeply sunken roots.

712
00:26:14.510 --> 00:26:16.310 line:15%
You both count to three and then lift (grunts)

713
00:26:16.310 --> 00:26:18.620 line:15%
at once and you hear (makes breaking noises)

714
00:26:18.620 --> 00:26:20.050 line:15%
as it tears up outta the ground.

715
00:26:20.050 --> 00:26:22.150 line:15%
You can see some of the roots just splinter and break

716
00:26:22.150 --> 00:26:24.230 line:15%
and some just pull up right outta the soft earth

717
00:26:24.230 --> 00:26:26.711 line:15%
as you both lift and give it a shove and it

718
00:26:26.711 --> 00:26:29.070 line:15%
(imitated splashing and thumping noises)

719
00:26:29.070 --> 00:26:30.187 line:15%
and it kind of like--
Damn.

720
00:26:30.187 --> 00:26:32.010 line:15%
Floats out over the water and kinda sinks halfway

721
00:26:32.010 --> 00:26:35.400 line:15%
before it finds enough soot and muck underneath

722
00:26:35.400 --> 00:26:37.662 line:15%
to come to rest.
She's a brick--

723
00:26:37.662 --> 00:26:39.096 line:15%
(laughing)

724
00:26:39.096 --> 00:26:40.081 line:15%
[Travis &amp; Marisha] House.

725
00:26:40.081 --> 00:26:41.280 line:15%
The mist has kind of come in quickly in this space,

726
00:26:41.280 --> 00:26:43.380 line:15%
which, by the way, if you could, Caduceus,

727
00:26:43.380 --> 00:26:44.810 line:15%
role again 'cause it would be, the disadvantage

728
00:26:44.810 --> 00:26:45.730 line:15%
would be heavy mist around you.

729
00:26:45.730 --> 00:26:47.980 line:15%
Oh, that's fine.
And aphids just go fff.

730
00:26:49.170 --> 00:26:51.370 line:15%
That's even higher, so 20 is still the--

731
00:26:51.370 --> 00:26:53.167 line:15%
Okay.
20 is still the roll.

732
00:26:53.167 --> 00:26:54.180 line:15%
So, the splash hits, you're about maybe,

733
00:26:54.180 --> 00:26:55.840 line:15%
that took no time, you guys took maybe

734
00:26:55.840 --> 00:26:57.570 line:15%
two minutes to get that thing outta the way.

735
00:26:57.570 --> 00:26:59.420 line:15%
So, you're still partially into this.

736
00:27:00.490 --> 00:27:02.200 line:15%
Right as you guys are kind of, you know,

737
00:27:02.200 --> 00:27:04.740 line:15%
getting excited about that, you see something,

738
00:27:04.740 --> 00:27:06.540 line:15%
a shape in the mist.
What does it look like?

739
00:27:06.540 --> 00:27:07.630 line:15%
What does the shape look like?

740
00:27:07.630 --> 00:27:08.830 line:15%
Looks like a--
There.

741
00:27:08.830 --> 00:27:10.240 line:15%
Kinda like just like a person.

742
00:27:10.240 --> 00:27:11.640 line:15%
Is it a ghost?
Person,

743
00:27:11.640 --> 00:27:12.980 line:15%
it looks like a person.
A person?

744
00:27:12.980 --> 00:27:15.020 line:15%
It looks kinda just like a person?

745
00:27:15.020 --> 00:27:16.802 line:15%
Then there's three more.

746
00:27:16.802 --> 00:27:17.635 line:15%
(gasping)

747
00:27:17.635 --> 00:27:18.468 line:15%
Oh, it's a ghost.
Floating?

748
00:27:18.468 --> 00:27:19.620 line:15%
How far away?
They're just

749
00:27:19.620 --> 00:27:21.350 line:15%
shapes in the mist that you can barely make out.

750
00:27:21.350 --> 00:27:22.240 line:15%
And you guys can't even see,

751
00:27:22.240 --> 00:27:24.410 line:15%
you're the one who's pointing originally.

752
00:27:24.410 --> 00:27:26.150 line:15%
Jester, you can just make it out a little bit.

753
00:27:26.150 --> 00:27:28.557 line:15%
Cast faster, cast faster, cast faster.

754
00:27:28.557 --> 00:27:29.699 line:15%
(squawking)

755
00:27:29.699 --> 00:27:30.810 line:15%
(laughing)

756
00:27:30.810 --> 00:27:33.060 line:15%
Six minutes, five minutes, I don't know.

757
00:27:33.060 --> 00:27:35.070 line:15%
You see a shape kinda come out of the water--

758
00:27:35.070 --> 00:27:36.340 line:15%
Oh!
Not too far

759
00:27:36.340 --> 00:27:39.230 line:15%
from where you are, on the edge of where

760
00:27:39.230 --> 00:27:41.050 line:15%
the trunk of the tree had hit the edge,

761
00:27:41.050 --> 00:27:43.470 line:15%
you see a shape, a person kinda rise up out of it.

762
00:27:43.470 --> 00:27:44.750 line:15%
I get their attention.

763
00:27:44.750 --> 00:27:47.300 line:15%
Move closer and start preppin'.

764
00:27:47.300 --> 00:27:49.815 line:15%
Caduceus, tell us what these are.

765
00:27:49.815 --> 00:27:51.117 line:15%
Quickly check, I'm checking,

766
00:27:51.117 --> 00:27:52.130 line:15%
I'm doing the, is it, are they undead?

767
00:27:52.130 --> 00:27:54.510 line:15%
I'm doing the--
You're doing which one?

768
00:27:54.510 --> 00:27:56.920 line:15%
The Eyes of the Grave.
Eyes of the Grave.

769
00:27:56.920 --> 00:28:00.070 line:15%
What's the range on that?
Range on that is 60 feet.

770
00:28:00.070 --> 00:28:03.250 line:15%
I know the location of any undead within 60 feet that isn't

771
00:28:03.250 --> 00:28:05.700 line:15%
behind total cover.
Okay, cool.

772
00:28:05.700 --> 00:28:07.770 line:15%
You got about 15 that suddenly

773
00:28:07.770 --> 00:28:08.760 line:15%
show up--
And it's undead?

774
00:28:08.760 --> 00:28:10.210 line:15%
Immediately around you as undead.

775
00:28:10.210 --> 00:28:12.890 line:15%
I'm gonna Turn Undead, you gonna do the same thing?

776
00:28:12.890 --> 00:28:14.360 line:15%
You first or do you wanna--

777
00:28:14.360 --> 00:28:16.148 line:15%
Well first, let's go ahead and roll initiative.

778
00:28:16.148 --> 00:28:17.619 line:15%
(cheering)

779
00:28:17.619 --> 00:28:18.905 line:15%
(clapping)

780
00:28:18.905 --> 00:28:19.808 line:15%
Oh, it's so low.

781
00:28:19.808 --> 00:28:20.641 line:15%
(clapping)

782
00:28:20.641 --> 00:28:21.474 line:15%
Fight, fight, fight.

783
00:28:21.474 --> 00:28:22.307 line:15%
Not gonna leave us high and dry.

784
00:28:22.307 --> 00:28:24.430 line:15%
No, we caught a bite.
My body's happy.

785
00:28:25.581 --> 00:28:28.331 line:15%
Last week was just a sample fight, it barely counted.

786
00:28:29.619 --> 00:28:30.452 line:15%
You guys have to charge, you charge right into

787
00:28:30.452 --> 00:28:32.670 line:15%
the depths of the swamp right as the night kicks in

788
00:28:32.670 --> 00:28:34.244 line:15%
and make loud noises?

789
00:28:34.244 --> 00:28:35.077
Yeah, we just--
Dwarven Forge,

790
00:28:35.077 --> 00:28:35.910
dwarvenforge.com--
We just decided to--

791
00:28:35.910 --> 00:28:36.743
Dwarven Forge, Dwarven Forge.

792
00:28:36.743 --> 00:28:37.576
Yeah, what are we gonna do?

793
00:28:37.576 --> 00:28:38.790
What're we gonna do camp outside of our hut?

794
00:28:38.790 --> 00:28:39.623
Yeah, we can.

795
00:28:40.765 --> 00:28:42.768
It must be done.
Here comes the mist.

796
00:28:42.768 --> 00:28:44.220
Not a good initiative, not good at all.

797
00:28:44.220 --> 00:28:45.320
Oh no.
Oh no,

798
00:28:45.320 --> 00:28:46.710
initiative, I knew I forgot something.

799
00:28:46.710 --> 00:28:48.730
Roll well, roll really well.
Balls.

800
00:28:48.730 --> 00:28:49.701
Okay, now it's gonna--

801
00:28:49.701 --> 00:28:51.131
(talking over each other)

802
00:28:51.131 --> 00:28:51.964
Those aren't balls, they're anus.

803
00:28:51.964 --> 00:28:53.540
Balls, balls, and anus.

804
00:28:53.540 --> 00:28:54.837
Love that song.

805
00:28:54.837 --> 00:28:55.670
(laughing)

806
00:28:55.670 --> 00:28:57.882
Parents, if you're watching with your kids, we apologize.

807
00:28:57.882 --> 00:28:58.715
(laughing)

808
00:28:58.715 --> 00:28:59.944
Nothing wrong with balls and anus.

809
00:28:59.944 --> 00:29:02.836
Those are medical terms.
Medical terms, exactly.

810
00:29:02.836 --> 00:29:06.240
So, you got--
Inbetweenus, Mr. Grinch.

811
00:29:07.675 --> 00:29:08.920
As far as you know.
By the way, our new book

812
00:29:08.920 --> 00:29:11.279
is gonna be in stores soon: Everyone Has An Anus.

813
00:29:11.279 --> 00:29:14.195
(laughing)

814
00:29:14.195 --> 00:29:16.880
I mean, it's true.
With little decals

815
00:29:16.880 --> 00:29:19.540
and vinyl stickers.
Oh god.

816
00:29:20.500 --> 00:29:22.020
Me and Yasha would be standing next to

817
00:29:22.020 --> 00:29:24.400
each other 'cause we just did the trunk.

818
00:29:24.400 --> 00:29:25.980
Oh yay--
You guys're gonna be--

819
00:29:25.980 --> 00:29:29.750
'Bout time.
All right, and so--

820
00:29:29.750 --> 00:29:31.830
It's, that's so cool, though, come on.

821
00:29:31.830 --> 00:29:34.050
That's so cool.
Look at these trees.

822
00:29:36.170 --> 00:29:37.840
Oh wow, wow.
Look at the log

823
00:29:37.840 --> 00:29:40.127
and the fuckin' moss, all right, I'm gonna chill.

824
00:29:40.127 --> 00:29:42.146
(laughing)

825
00:29:42.146 --> 00:29:44.394
Not that this is not being recorded, but

826
00:29:44.394 --> 00:29:45.227
(laughing)

827
00:29:45.227 --> 00:29:46.060
this is really cool.
For your own--

828
00:29:46.060 --> 00:29:47.600
I gotta make sure somebody sees this.

829
00:29:47.600 --> 00:29:48.433
(laughing)

830
00:29:48.433 --> 00:29:49.266
Matt's like, "Yeah, you fucks.

831
00:29:49.266 --> 00:29:50.440
"You shoulda seen my map last week."

832
00:29:50.440 --> 00:29:51.273
(laughing)

833
00:29:51.273 --> 00:29:52.195
Yup.

834
00:29:52.195 --> 00:29:54.144
(laughing)

835
00:29:54.144 --> 00:29:55.550
Not that long ago.
Oh god.

836
00:29:55.550 --> 00:29:56.640
Yup.
Oh god.

837
00:29:57.675 --> 00:29:59.020
Oh my god, he's got a lotta minis.

838
00:29:59.020 --> 00:30:00.050
There's 15 of them.

839
00:30:00.050 --> 00:30:01.080
Yeah, there's a lotta minis.

840
00:30:01.080 --> 00:30:02.620
Maybe they all have--
Caduceus.

841
00:30:02.620 --> 00:30:05.230
Three hit points.
Meet me in the garden.

842
00:30:05.230 --> 00:30:06.600
[Liam, Ashley &amp; Laura] HoeGaarden.

843
00:30:06.600 --> 00:30:07.859
(grunting)

844
00:30:07.859 --> 00:30:08.730
(laughing)

845
00:30:08.730 --> 00:30:09.840
Big deep throwback.

846
00:30:09.840 --> 00:30:12.540
Maybe some glowy, glowy fisties?

847
00:30:12.540 --> 00:30:13.550
Glowy fisties?
To say that out loud.

848
00:30:13.550 --> 00:30:14.570
Yeah, I got it.

849
00:30:14.570 --> 00:30:15.750
Did you just say glowy fisty?

850
00:30:15.750 --> 00:30:19.110
Glowy fisties, Caddy.
Glowy fisties.

851
00:30:19.110 --> 00:30:20.620
I may not have it.
Oh wait.

852
00:30:20.620 --> 00:30:22.730
If you do--
If you have it.

853
00:30:22.730 --> 00:30:24.190
Glowy fisty night at Booty LA.

854
00:30:24.190 --> 00:30:25.730
If you do that--
I may not have it.

855
00:30:25.730 --> 00:30:26.670
We won't be able to do--

856
00:30:26.670 --> 00:30:29.724
Yeah, I may not actually have glowy fisty right now.

857
00:30:29.724 --> 00:30:31.631
(gentle music)

858
00:30:31.631 --> 00:30:32.464
And then--
Wow,

859
00:30:32.464 --> 00:30:35.550
Matt is setting up a lot of miniatures.

860
00:30:35.550 --> 00:30:37.960
I actually don't, I don't have glowy fisty right now,

861
00:30:37.960 --> 00:30:38.793
so.
Oh god.

862
00:30:40.316 --> 00:30:41.913
(sighing)

863
00:30:41.913 --> 00:30:43.630
All right.

864
00:30:43.630 --> 00:30:45.480
Oh.
Oh, and lighting change?

865
00:30:45.480 --> 00:30:47.152
Come on.
Please.

866
00:30:47.152 --> 00:30:48.880
As you make that point, and you guys

867
00:30:48.880 --> 00:30:51.170
begin see these shapes move and shift,

868
00:30:51.170 --> 00:30:53.840
you see the one that comes outta the water nearby,

869
00:30:53.840 --> 00:30:57.200
right over on that side near Jester and Yasha,

870
00:30:57.200 --> 00:31:00.730
the trunk that has kinda floated out in that direction,

871
00:31:00.730 --> 00:31:01.710
you see it kinda rise up and go--

872
00:31:01.710 --> 00:31:03.060
That's a scary one.
And you see

873
00:31:03.060 --> 00:31:06.020
they're humanoid, though largely their flesh is

874
00:31:06.020 --> 00:31:10.660
kinda bloated and sloughing off their body in places,

875
00:31:11.720 --> 00:31:14.900
swollen and green, kind of just this

876
00:31:14.900 --> 00:31:17.310
horrible toxic zombie-type persona

877
00:31:17.310 --> 00:31:19.430
and it looks like it will move really slow.

878
00:31:19.430 --> 00:31:22.159
And it goes, fssh!
No!

879
00:31:22.159 --> 00:31:23.622
(groaning)

880
00:31:23.622 --> 00:31:25.370
Oh, stop.
Rushes with a speed

881
00:31:25.370 --> 00:31:28.580
faster than any sort of zombie you've seen in your time.

882
00:31:28.580 --> 00:31:31.730
I hate fast zombies.
So, initiative please.

883
00:31:31.730 --> 00:31:33.230
If everyone hasn't rolled yet.

884
00:31:34.627 --> 00:31:35.770
I rolled shit.
I did, too.

885
00:31:35.770 --> 00:31:36.603
I rolled shit.

886
00:31:36.603 --> 00:31:38.350
Rolled average.
He's rolling really well.

887
00:31:38.350 --> 00:31:40.090
Natural 20.
Oh!

888
00:31:40.090 --> 00:31:41.310
That's the opposite of what I rolled.

889
00:31:41.310 --> 00:31:43.480
All right, so 25 to 20?

890
00:31:44.630 --> 00:31:46.610
20.
Oh shit!

891
00:31:46.610 --> 00:31:47.730
Yasha is going with them.

892
00:31:47.730 --> 00:31:50.540
Yasha!
Ashley Johnson.

893
00:31:50.540 --> 00:31:52.742
I'm doin' slo-mo on the smoke.

894
00:31:52.742 --> 00:31:54.940
(laughing)

895
00:31:54.940 --> 00:31:55.773
Alrighty.

896
00:31:56.850 --> 00:31:57.890
20 to 15?
16.

897
00:31:59.131 --> 00:31:59.964
16.
18.

898
00:31:59.964 --> 00:32:01.090
Oh, shit.
Gotta write this stuff down.

899
00:32:01.090 --> 00:32:02.360
All right.
Nott.

900
00:32:02.360 --> 00:32:04.530
Nott, you said 16, oh, Caduceus got 16?

901
00:32:05.740 --> 00:32:07.220
Then Beau, all right.

902
00:32:07.220 --> 00:32:08.790
15 and 10?

903
00:32:08.790 --> 00:32:09.623
12.

904
00:32:12.790 --> 00:32:14.920
Ten to five?
Eight.

905
00:32:16.030 --> 00:32:17.980
Is this all the same day?
Yeah.

906
00:32:17.980 --> 00:32:19.530
Oh, I guess it won't affect us too much,

907
00:32:19.530 --> 00:32:21.130
but we're all exhausted, so--
Yes, you all have a point,

908
00:32:21.130 --> 00:32:23.500
well, most of you have a point of exhaustion.

909
00:32:23.500 --> 00:32:27.430
I rolled a one.
All right, Fjord's up front.

910
00:32:27.430 --> 00:32:28.263
Okay.
I basically

911
00:32:28.263 --> 00:32:29.590
didn't even notice anything. (laughs)

912
00:32:29.590 --> 00:32:30.490
So--
What're you guys

913
00:32:30.490 --> 00:32:31.580
gettin' all excited for?
Yasha,

914
00:32:31.580 --> 00:32:33.280
what's your dexterity?

915
00:32:33.280 --> 00:32:36.770
My dexterity is 15.
I'll let you go first, then.

916
00:32:36.770 --> 00:32:37.810
Oh.
Okay.

917
00:32:37.810 --> 00:32:40.190
Oh.
Um, okay, so,

918
00:32:42.940 --> 00:32:45.330
who's nearest?
Who's nearest?

919
00:32:45.330 --> 00:32:46.990
You have these two, they're almost equidistant.

920
00:32:46.990 --> 00:32:48.390
This one is probably closest to you there.

921
00:32:48.390 --> 00:32:50.650
Okay, I'm gonna go over there.

922
00:32:52.340 --> 00:32:54.230
I would like to rage.
Yes, you would.

923
00:32:54.230 --> 00:32:56.450
Alrighty, drawing which blade?

924
00:32:58.040 --> 00:32:59.770
Your witch blade.
My

925
00:33:01.890 --> 00:33:03.300
Skin Gorger.
You got it.

926
00:33:03.300 --> 00:33:06.110
Shh, you charge through, sploosh, sploosh.

927
00:33:06.110 --> 00:33:09.660
Now, in this space, your movement is--

928
00:33:09.660 --> 00:33:11.400
Halved.
Halved because you are in

929
00:33:11.400 --> 00:33:14.240
pretty heavy swamp around the space of where you guys

930
00:33:14.240 --> 00:33:16.580
are currently located.
Okay.

931
00:33:16.580 --> 00:33:17.500
But you get there without an issue.

932
00:33:17.500 --> 00:33:18.700
So, you rush into the first one

933
00:33:18.700 --> 00:33:20.010
and it's there in front of you.

934
00:33:20.010 --> 00:33:22.980
Now, as opposed to just an undead

935
00:33:22.980 --> 00:33:24.520
and a zombie that's falling apart,

936
00:33:24.520 --> 00:33:25.960
and you've encountered a number of those in spaces,

937
00:33:25.960 --> 00:33:27.870
this reminds you of some of the zombies

938
00:33:27.870 --> 00:33:29.820
that you've seen in elements of Xhorhas

939
00:33:30.670 --> 00:33:34.010
that are usually curse-based husk zombies

940
00:33:34.010 --> 00:33:36.230
or they're created by nergaliids,

941
00:33:36.230 --> 00:33:37.960
similar in ways to the ones that

942
00:33:37.960 --> 00:33:40.200
showed up at the carnival when you first--

943
00:33:40.200 --> 00:33:42.340
Oh.
Met up with these people.

944
00:33:42.340 --> 00:33:45.532
They are faster, their fingers are bladed,

945
00:33:45.532 --> 00:33:46.365
(gasping)

946
00:33:46.365 --> 00:33:48.020
and they're, all around, a little more

947
00:33:48.020 --> 00:33:50.110
volatile than your standard lumbering undead.

948
00:33:50.110 --> 00:33:51.550
But nevertheless, in that moment

949
00:33:51.550 --> 00:33:53.110
of recognition, your blade is out.

950
00:33:53.110 --> 00:33:54.360
What are you doing?
Okay.

951
00:33:54.360 --> 00:33:55.850
I'm going to attack.
All right.

952
00:33:55.850 --> 00:33:57.200
Go for the head.
Yeah.

953
00:33:58.450 --> 00:33:59.283
Yeah.

954
00:34:01.320 --> 00:34:03.950
That would be a 28 to hit.

955
00:34:03.950 --> 00:34:05.595
That'll hit.
Okay.

956
00:34:05.595 --> 00:34:06.795
'Cause it's so rusted.

957
00:34:07.700 --> 00:34:09.110
That's what you have to be careful about,

958
00:34:09.110 --> 00:34:12.670
it's not the blade.
That shot is a bitch, too.

959
00:34:12.670 --> 00:34:15.340
It hurts, it's like two days, you gotta rub it.

960
00:34:15.340 --> 00:34:17.310
I'm gonna roll those again because of,

961
00:34:21.240 --> 00:34:22.567
yeah, I'm gonna take that hit.

962
00:34:25.178 --> 00:34:28.200
12, 13, 23 for the first hit.

963
00:34:28.200 --> 00:34:29.730
23 points of damage?
Yup.

964
00:34:29.730 --> 00:34:30.590
Nice.

965
00:34:31.870 --> 00:34:33.770
You hack through, sshunk, carving through,

966
00:34:33.770 --> 00:34:35.670
and you see its body kinda open up a bit.

967
00:34:35.670 --> 00:34:39.230
As it does, as opposed to the black coagulated blood,

968
00:34:39.230 --> 00:34:40.990
almost like moss kinda pours out

969
00:34:40.990 --> 00:34:42.370
with the wound as it opens up.

970
00:34:42.370 --> 00:34:45.010
The arm itself splinters a bit but holds in place

971
00:34:45.010 --> 00:34:47.800
and then kinda like (groans).
Oh, that's gross.

972
00:34:47.800 --> 00:34:48.930
Okay, second hit.

973
00:34:50.220 --> 00:34:51.980
Oh, same, 28.
That'll do.

974
00:34:51.980 --> 00:34:53.640
Roll damage a second time.
Okay.

975
00:34:55.401 --> 00:34:58.234
(dice clattering)

976
00:34:59.246 --> 00:35:00.500
Gonna roll again.

977
00:35:00.500 --> 00:35:02.088
Okay, same.

978
00:35:02.088 --> 00:35:04.671
(gentle music)

979
00:35:05.901 --> 00:35:06.734
(panting)

980
00:35:06.734 --> 00:35:10.710
12 points of damage.
12 points of damage, nice.

981
00:35:10.710 --> 00:35:12.190
Second strike, kshh, carves through

982
00:35:12.190 --> 00:35:14.860
and jams partway in its torso, shhk, and gets stuck

983
00:35:14.860 --> 00:35:16.590
and the creature kind of (gasps) bows for a second

984
00:35:16.590 --> 00:35:18.573
like it's about to collapse and then kinda

985
00:35:18.573 --> 00:35:20.490
(gasps) back up at you with the blade

986
00:35:20.490 --> 00:35:22.560
still kind of stuck in its torso.

987
00:35:22.560 --> 00:35:25.270
As you pull back, it lurches forward towards you.

988
00:35:25.270 --> 00:35:26.710
Now, they're all gonna go.

989
00:35:26.710 --> 00:35:28.010
Oh.
Pay up, Matt.

990
00:35:28.010 --> 00:35:30.120
Before you go forward, can we add my resident echo

991
00:35:30.120 --> 00:35:31.400
to the map?
Oh, good call,

992
00:35:31.400 --> 00:35:33.420
'cause you do still have him.
How long does he last?

993
00:35:33.420 --> 00:35:35.046
Eight hours.
Tight.

994
00:35:35.046 --> 00:35:36.360
Where would you like him to go?

995
00:35:36.360 --> 00:35:38.810
I would've had him be a lookout, so I don't think he would

996
00:35:38.810 --> 00:35:41.240
be right with us.
Ooh.

997
00:35:41.240 --> 00:35:42.300
Maybe there?
Oh, there he is.

998
00:35:42.300 --> 00:35:44.030
It's the nega-Caleb.
Yep.

999
00:35:46.377 --> 00:35:48.870
Could I put him standing under this tree?

1000
00:35:48.870 --> 00:35:50.920
Sure.
'Cause he doesn't have to

1001
00:35:50.920 --> 00:35:53.780
worry about swampies.
You got it.

1002
00:35:53.780 --> 00:35:54.910
Okay, cool.

1003
00:35:56.220 --> 00:35:57.420
So, now it's their turn.

1004
00:36:00.365 --> 00:36:02.243
(whooshing)

1005
00:36:02.243 --> 00:36:03.410
(squeaking)

1006
00:36:03.410 --> 00:36:04.560
Oh god, they're so fast.

1007
00:36:04.560 --> 00:36:05.650
They are very fast.

1008
00:36:05.650 --> 00:36:06.880
Even with their reduced movement,

1009
00:36:06.880 --> 00:36:09.620
they are much quicker than any zombie you've encountered,

1010
00:36:09.620 --> 00:36:11.680
although, no, you've encountered these once a long time ago.

1011
00:36:11.680 --> 00:36:13.600
A long time ago.
These are--

1012
00:36:13.600 --> 00:36:15.180
It's like when they remove frames

1013
00:36:15.180 --> 00:36:16.932
in a horror film and they just--

1014
00:36:16.932 --> 00:36:17.964
Oh god.
You know?

1015
00:36:17.964 --> 00:36:18.797
Yeah.
Yeah.

1016
00:36:18.797 --> 00:36:19.630
(hissing)

1017
00:36:19.630 --> 00:36:21.110
Go for the net--
Oh, I hate that shit.

1018
00:36:21.110 --> 00:36:21.943
(laughing)

1019
00:36:21.943 --> 00:36:23.270
That's like, I have nightmares like that.

1020
00:36:23.270 --> 00:36:25.340
For clarification?
Yes?

1021
00:36:26.350 --> 00:36:28.810
I rolled savage attack on both of those,

1022
00:36:30.560 --> 00:36:32.430
Savage Attacker, but the second,

1023
00:36:32.430 --> 00:36:35.220
that second one that I rolled, I rolled the same--

1024
00:36:35.220 --> 00:36:36.060
Gotcha, okay.
Both times.

1025
00:36:36.060 --> 00:36:38.110
So, I just realized, I was like,

1026
00:36:38.110 --> 00:36:39.400
"I think I can only use that once per turn."

1027
00:36:39.400 --> 00:36:40.780
Sorry.
That's all good.

1028
00:36:40.780 --> 00:36:41.613
But thank you for being honest.

1029
00:36:41.613 --> 00:36:42.842
Just so later, people

1030
00:36:42.842 --> 00:36:44.155
aren't like, "You did it wrong."

1031
00:36:44.155 --> 00:36:45.264
(laughing)

1032
00:36:45.264 --> 00:36:46.336
(talking over each other)

1033
00:36:46.336 --> 00:36:47.500
I know I did.
I know,

1034
00:36:47.500 --> 00:36:48.400
I'm letting you know I know.

1035
00:36:48.400 --> 00:36:50.380
Yeah, I'm letting you know I know.

1036
00:36:50.380 --> 00:36:51.890
I realized.
It's a side roll.

1037
00:36:51.890 --> 00:36:53.880
It's a Fred Savage attack, it's not the same thing.

1038
00:36:53.880 --> 00:36:56.297
Fred Savage attack.
Yup, yup.

1039
00:36:56.297 --> 00:36:57.130
That's a lot--

1040
00:36:57.130 --> 00:36:59.050
So, the one that you've jammed the blade in

1041
00:36:59.050 --> 00:37:01.600
and it's nearly dead, it goes, (gasps) looks at you

1042
00:37:02.997 --> 00:37:05.730
and you watch as its chest kinda pulses and inflates,

1043
00:37:05.730 --> 00:37:08.570
bssh, it bursts into a spray of toxic,

1044
00:37:08.570 --> 00:37:09.964
visceral liquid--
Fuck.

1045
00:37:09.964 --> 00:37:11.080
Ugh.
Go ahead

1046
00:37:11.080 --> 00:37:12.180
and make a constitution saving throw--

1047
00:37:12.180 --> 00:37:13.770
Oh my god.
Sheesh.

1048
00:37:15.160 --> 00:37:16.588
Constitution?
Yeah,

1049
00:37:16.588 --> 00:37:18.393
constitution saving throw, please.

1050
00:37:18.393 --> 00:37:19.850
(groaning)

1051
00:37:19.850 --> 00:37:22.150
Seven, I mean ten.
Ten,

1052
00:37:22.150 --> 00:37:24.780
that is still a failure, you

1053
00:37:25.722 --> 00:37:26.580
(dice clattering)

1054
00:37:26.580 --> 00:37:29.841
take 18 points of poison damage.

1055
00:37:29.841 --> 00:37:32.280
Oh!
One eight?

1056
00:37:32.280 --> 00:37:33.113
Yes.
Ooh.

1057
00:37:33.113 --> 00:37:35.530
As it explodes, it is destroyed but you are

1058
00:37:35.530 --> 00:37:37.820
coated in this horrible poisonous liquid

1059
00:37:37.820 --> 00:37:39.590
that kinda like scars the flesh a bit

1060
00:37:39.590 --> 00:37:41.140
and it's all in your eyes and your mouth

1061
00:37:41.140 --> 00:37:42.940
and it burns and it's awful.
Ugh.

1062
00:37:44.079 --> 00:37:45.400
Doesn't happen to hurt the gentleman next to him, does it?

1063
00:37:45.400 --> 00:37:46.233
He doesn't seem affected by it.

1064
00:37:46.233 --> 00:37:47.550
He's gonna attack you twice.

1065
00:37:47.550 --> 00:37:50.510
Oh my god.

1066
00:37:50.510 --> 00:37:52.370
Oh, shit.
No, don't--

1067
00:37:52.370 --> 00:37:54.580
Two 18s, literally, in a row.

1068
00:37:54.580 --> 00:37:56.410
That, it's--
Two 18s.

1069
00:37:56.410 --> 00:37:58.130
Yeah, so that'll be a 23 each.

1070
00:37:59.180 --> 00:38:00.260
All right, you take--

1071
00:38:02.564 --> 00:38:05.310
(dice clattering)

1072
00:38:05.310 --> 00:38:06.810
Turn Undead might be bad, then.

1073
00:38:06.810 --> 00:38:08.440
17 points of bludgeoning damage,

1074
00:38:08.440 --> 00:38:12.210
which, you are raging, so that is halved to eight,

1075
00:38:12.210 --> 00:38:13.870
I believe, eight points of bludgeoning damage to you.

1076
00:38:13.870 --> 00:38:15.130
'Kay.
Yeah.

1077
00:38:15.130 --> 00:38:16.560
All right, that's two attacks on you,

1078
00:38:16.560 --> 00:38:18.510
Jester.
Me?

1079
00:38:18.510 --> 00:38:20.290
That's four attacks on you from two of them.

1080
00:38:20.290 --> 00:38:21.880
Little old me?
Yep!

1081
00:38:21.880 --> 00:38:23.283
There are two of them that are

1082
00:38:23.283 --> 00:38:25.107
currently rushed in towards you.

1083
00:38:25.107 --> 00:38:26.610
Do not freak them.
Okay.

1084
00:38:26.610 --> 00:38:29.830
All right, natural one misses, that's cocked.

1085
00:38:29.830 --> 00:38:30.980
They rolled really bad.

1086
00:38:31.850 --> 00:38:34.483
The highest one is a 15.
Oh.

1087
00:38:35.574 --> 00:38:36.460
What's your armor class?
18.

1088
00:38:36.460 --> 00:38:37.650
They just rush in and strike close with

1089
00:38:37.650 --> 00:38:39.570
their fingers are clawing and you're holding up your shield

1090
00:38:39.570 --> 00:38:41.360
and you're kind of like one gets close to you

1091
00:38:41.360 --> 00:38:43.353
and you bash it away and it backs up again

1092
00:38:43.353 --> 00:38:44.186
(growling)

1093
00:38:44.186 --> 00:38:47.500
about to level back and go in for the assault a second time.

1094
00:38:47.500 --> 00:38:48.810
Caduceus, you have one that rushed up to you

1095
00:38:48.810 --> 00:38:51.239
and it's gonna attack you twice.

1096
00:38:51.239 --> 00:38:52.360
(dice clattering)

1097
00:38:52.360 --> 00:38:53.310
Oh, twice in a row.

1098
00:38:54.690 --> 00:38:56.780
13 and a 13s.
No, and I'm gonna use

1099
00:38:56.780 --> 00:38:59.080
Shield of Retribution.
Okay, go for it.

1100
00:38:59.080 --> 00:39:00.380
So, misses with a melee attack.

1101
00:39:00.380 --> 00:39:02.320
I can just block them with Arcane Force.

1102
00:39:02.320 --> 00:39:04.530
They suffer four D6 force damage

1103
00:39:05.620 --> 00:39:09.250
and they also have to move 20 feet away from me.

1104
00:39:10.180 --> 00:39:11.350
Ooh, tight.
So--

1105
00:39:11.350 --> 00:39:13.664
Shield of Retribusch.
Whoa.

1106
00:39:13.664 --> 00:39:18.110
Those dice are beautiful.
15, 16, 17, 18, 19.

1107
00:39:18.110 --> 00:39:19.270
19 points.
19 points

1108
00:39:19.270 --> 00:39:20.920
of force damage and 20 feet back.

1109
00:39:20.920 --> 00:39:22.560
So, it runs towards you, leaps in the air,

1110
00:39:22.560 --> 00:39:24.130
and as it goes to strike with both claws,

1111
00:39:24.130 --> 00:39:26.120
you hold the shield up, take the blow,

1112
00:39:26.120 --> 00:39:28.699
and, bssh, shove it off as a blast of energy, pssh.

1113
00:39:28.699 --> 00:39:30.770
Fires it, throwing it back 20 feet.

1114
00:39:30.770 --> 00:39:32.792
It (makes crashing noises) lands and then,

1115
00:39:32.792 --> 00:39:35.630
(makes squelching noise) jumps up with an unexpected speed

1116
00:39:35.630 --> 00:39:37.770
and is getting ready to come back next round.

1117
00:39:37.770 --> 00:39:38.890
Whoa.
That's really--

1118
00:39:38.890 --> 00:39:41.350
These two are gonna go after your echo, Caleb.

1119
00:39:41.350 --> 00:39:42.870
Uh huh, uh huh.
It's four strikes

1120
00:39:42.870 --> 00:39:46.002
against it, the first two--
He's a tank, he'll be fine.

1121
00:39:46.002 --> 00:39:47.450
(laughing)

1122
00:39:47.450 --> 00:39:48.680
13 and a 14?

1123
00:39:49.830 --> 00:39:51.160
No.
Wow.

1124
00:39:51.160 --> 00:39:52.285
No!

1125
00:39:52.285 --> 00:39:53.280
(laughing)

1126
00:39:53.280 --> 00:39:54.750
They don't hit!
Hey!

1127
00:39:54.750 --> 00:39:57.330
But it doesn't have mage armor on it.

1128
00:39:57.330 --> 00:39:59.326
I don't have mage armor on.
Okay.

1129
00:39:59.326 --> 00:40:00.340
I have Elven chain and--
That's true.

1130
00:40:00.340 --> 00:40:02.860
Yeah, there you go, so both those miss.

1131
00:40:02.860 --> 00:40:04.476
First time for everything.

1132
00:40:04.476 --> 00:40:05.570
(laughing)

1133
00:40:05.570 --> 00:40:07.014
Whoosh, whoosh, really?

1134
00:40:07.014 --> 00:40:07.847
(laughing)

1135
00:40:07.847 --> 00:40:08.680
And two more strikes against you.

1136
00:40:08.680 --> 00:40:10.450
Just a mime going.

1137
00:40:10.450 --> 00:40:11.283
(laughing)

1138
00:40:11.283 --> 00:40:14.495
That's 21 and 21.
Oh yeah, those hit.

1139
00:40:14.495 --> 00:40:15.930
(laughing)

1140
00:40:15.930 --> 00:40:16.763
He's gone.

1141
00:40:17.608 --> 00:40:18.610
Are those against your shadow or--

1142
00:40:18.610 --> 00:40:20.810
He's a confetti filled balloon, guys, pff.

1143
00:40:22.131 --> 00:40:22.964
(laughing)

1144
00:40:22.964 --> 00:40:25.036
He took 'em all.
13 points

1145
00:40:25.036 --> 00:40:27.960
of bludgeoning damage.
Oh.

1146
00:40:27.960 --> 00:40:28.793
No, he's still up.

1147
00:40:28.793 --> 00:40:30.040
That's from both of them?

1148
00:40:30.040 --> 00:40:30.980
Yeah, one of them missed two attacks,

1149
00:40:30.980 --> 00:40:32.430
the other one hit twice but didn't roll super high

1150
00:40:32.430 --> 00:40:34.490
in the damage.
Oh.

1151
00:40:34.490 --> 00:40:36.220
Are you low on health already?

1152
00:40:36.220 --> 00:40:37.730
No.
No, it's his echo.

1153
00:40:37.730 --> 00:40:40.420
It's his shadow.
Oh!

1154
00:40:40.420 --> 00:40:43.780
Yeah, it's, I've never used this spell, sorry.

1155
00:40:43.780 --> 00:40:44.613
It's all good.

1156
00:40:45.458 --> 00:40:46.480
That's gonna be four attacks--
It's still up!

1157
00:40:46.480 --> 00:40:48.277
Yeah, shit.
There you go.

1158
00:40:48.277 --> 00:40:50.421
(laughing)
(clapping)

1159
00:40:50.421 --> 00:40:52.410
Congratulations!
Take it, man.

1160
00:40:52.410 --> 00:40:55.000
That's four strikes against you, Fjord.

1161
00:40:55.000 --> 00:40:56.580
Yup.
Oh, shit.

1162
00:40:58.150 --> 00:41:00.250
Ooh.
That's a good sound.

1163
00:41:01.384 --> 00:41:05.250
That's what you wanna hear.
Yeah.

1164
00:41:05.250 --> 00:41:07.310
A seven, an eleven,

1165
00:41:08.831 --> 00:41:09.940
a 17, and a 19.

1166
00:41:09.940 --> 00:41:11.450
17 and 19 hits, the last two don't.

1167
00:41:11.450 --> 00:41:12.760
Okay.

1168
00:41:12.760 --> 00:41:16.560
So, that is 14 points of bludgeoning damage

1169
00:41:16.560 --> 00:41:17.490
to you.
Okay.

1170
00:41:17.490 --> 00:41:19.750
As both of them go just raking towards you,

1171
00:41:19.750 --> 00:41:22.970
bashing into you, trying desperately to get through,

1172
00:41:22.970 --> 00:41:25.210
and then the other tries coming through

1173
00:41:25.210 --> 00:41:28.330
and they slash into your torso and the side of your head

1174
00:41:28.330 --> 00:41:29.490
and you kinda like (grunts) go forward.

1175
00:41:29.490 --> 00:41:31.210
You can feel kinda the warmth as the blood

1176
00:41:31.210 --> 00:41:32.700
is kinda pouring through the scalp already

1177
00:41:32.700 --> 00:41:34.670
from where it slashed to the back of your head.

1178
00:41:35.580 --> 00:41:37.730
That is going to finish that one there.

1179
00:41:37.730 --> 00:41:39.870
There is now one against you, Caleb, with two strikes.

1180
00:41:39.870 --> 00:41:40.900
The 14 points of damage were

1181
00:41:40.900 --> 00:41:42.390
the last two strikes combined?

1182
00:41:42.390 --> 00:41:43.223
Yes.
Okay, gotcha.

1183
00:41:43.223 --> 00:41:44.890
I didn't make sure we're not actually--

1184
00:41:44.890 --> 00:41:45.723
So, that's two strikes against you, Caleb,

1185
00:41:45.723 --> 00:41:48.200
from the one that managed to squeeze through to get to you.

1186
00:41:48.200 --> 00:41:50.300
Ooh.

1187
00:41:50.300 --> 00:41:53.020
That is a 23 and a natural 20.

1188
00:41:53.020 --> 00:41:55.230
Those both seem to hit for some reason.

1189
00:41:55.230 --> 00:41:57.230
Cancel the natural 20.
Oh.

1190
00:41:57.230 --> 00:41:58.063
Yes.

1191
00:41:58.063 --> 00:41:59.552
Did you use your reaction in your shield?

1192
00:41:59.552 --> 00:42:00.385
Yeah, I think you did--
Oh, I don't know if that,

1193
00:42:00.385 --> 00:42:02.380
I don't know if the shield counts as a reaction, hold on.

1194
00:42:02.380 --> 00:42:04.502
Sam, to be--
Yeah, he'll Jose it.

1195
00:42:04.502 --> 00:42:06.190
(tongue clicking)

1196
00:42:06.190 --> 00:42:08.034
Yeah, it's my reaction, fuck, sorry.

1197
00:42:08.034 --> 00:42:08.867
(groaning)

1198
00:42:08.867 --> 00:42:10.600
Bring it on.
All right.

1199
00:42:10.600 --> 00:42:11.989
That is a

1200
00:42:11.989 --> 00:42:14.240
(muffled speaking)

1201
00:42:14.240 --> 00:42:16.130
seven points of slashing damage to you, Caleb.

1202
00:42:16.130 --> 00:42:17.430
Yeah, okay.
Then the crit.

1203
00:42:18.437 --> 00:42:20.410
I don't think I did, it wasn't marked.

1204
00:42:20.410 --> 00:42:23.768
10, 13 points of slashing damage on that one.

1205
00:42:23.768 --> 00:42:24.764
(whining)

1206
00:42:24.764 --> 00:42:26.058
(laughing)

1207
00:42:26.058 --> 00:42:27.230
That's not bad.
Not too bad.

1208
00:42:27.230 --> 00:42:28.063
Two attacks against you,

1209
00:42:28.063 --> 00:42:29.860
Beauregard.
Yeah.

1210
00:42:29.860 --> 00:42:31.760
This is the last of their run.

1211
00:42:31.760 --> 00:42:34.560
There's gonna be a 13--
Miss.

1212
00:42:34.560 --> 00:42:36.510
And a 20.
20 hits.

1213
00:42:36.510 --> 00:42:40.210
20 hits, you take seven points of

1214
00:42:40.210 --> 00:42:42.770
slashing damage.
Okay, that's fine.

1215
00:42:42.770 --> 00:42:45.260
That is the rest of their turn.

1216
00:42:45.260 --> 00:42:46.270
Next up comes Nott.

1217
00:42:46.270 --> 00:42:47.103
Nott, what're you doin'?

1218
00:42:47.103 --> 00:42:48.756
That was a lot of attacks.

1219
00:42:48.756 --> 00:42:49.589
Yeah.
That was a--

1220
00:42:49.589 --> 00:42:50.670
You go from just a couple of shadows in the mist

1221
00:42:50.670 --> 00:42:54.416
to suddenly being swarmed by this horrible (groaning)

1222
00:42:54.416 --> 00:42:55.900
Instant--
Sound of sucking,

1223
00:42:55.900 --> 00:42:59.020
terrible undead voices and you're just swarmed.

1224
00:42:59.020 --> 00:43:01.290
You hear an explosion and a scream off to the side,

1225
00:43:01.290 --> 00:43:03.990
your friends are being assailed by them, what're you doing?

1226
00:43:03.990 --> 00:43:05.190
I feel like--
Can I just,

1227
00:43:05.190 --> 00:43:06.560
there's one over here that we didn't move.

1228
00:43:06.560 --> 00:43:07.520
Oh, there is one over there.

1229
00:43:07.520 --> 00:43:09.997
Oh, thank you, thank you for that.

1230
00:43:09.997 --> 00:43:12.460
Kill, kill, kill.
That's not an undead,

1231
00:43:12.460 --> 00:43:13.968
that's just a pervert.

1232
00:43:13.968 --> 00:43:15.384
(laughing)

1233
00:43:15.384 --> 00:43:16.217
Hey, how you all doin' over,

1234
00:43:16.217 --> 00:43:17.400
oh.
The Gentleman?

1235
00:43:17.400 --> 00:43:18.910
What are you doin' here?
And actually,

1236
00:43:18.910 --> 00:43:20.130
these guys couldn't attack but they can still at least

1237
00:43:20.130 --> 00:43:21.070
get up in the mix.
Yeah.

1238
00:43:21.070 --> 00:43:22.827
Which they would anyway with

1239
00:43:22.827 --> 00:43:23.660
their dash action, so there we go.

1240
00:43:23.660 --> 00:43:24.690
Jeepers.
Oh no--

1241
00:43:24.690 --> 00:43:25.680
Actually, this one would probably

1242
00:43:25.680 --> 00:43:27.480
get behind Ashley there, so we'll go with that.

1243
00:43:27.480 --> 00:43:28.860
Jinkies.
Mmkay.

1244
00:43:28.860 --> 00:43:30.910
So, what're you doin', Nott?

1245
00:43:30.910 --> 00:43:32.130
She's right next to me, huh?

1246
00:43:32.130 --> 00:43:33.140
I'm sorry, I fucked that up for you.

1247
00:43:33.140 --> 00:43:35.040
No, that's fine, it's fine.

1248
00:43:35.040 --> 00:43:37.860
I feel like Yasha's okay, I feel like

1249
00:43:37.860 --> 00:43:39.560
Jester's gonna do some magic shit,

1250
00:43:40.550 --> 00:43:45.070
Fjord I don't really care about, Beau, Beau's fine.

1251
00:43:45.070 --> 00:43:47.070
I'll be fine.
I gotta protect Caleb.

1252
00:43:47.070 --> 00:43:49.740
I will shoot the one engaged with Caleb.

1253
00:43:49.740 --> 00:43:50.860
Right here?
Yes.

1254
00:43:50.860 --> 00:43:51.730
Go for it.
Okay.

1255
00:43:51.730 --> 00:43:53.091
Roll for an attack.

1256
00:43:53.091 --> 00:43:54.010
(dice clattering)

1257
00:43:54.010 --> 00:43:57.580
Four (laughs) plus 10, so 14.

1258
00:43:57.580 --> 00:43:58.850
That hits.
Hey!

1259
00:43:58.850 --> 00:44:00.930
They are very easy to hit.

1260
00:44:00.930 --> 00:44:04.330
They don't try and dodge, they don't have any armor.

1261
00:44:04.330 --> 00:44:05.870
Whoa, that was a good roll.

1262
00:44:05.870 --> 00:44:06.870
Yes it was.

1263
00:44:06.870 --> 00:44:08.370
20,

1264
00:44:08.370 --> 00:44:09.840
32 plus 6,

1265
00:44:09.840 --> 00:44:13.530
38, 38 points of damage.

1266
00:44:13.530 --> 00:44:15.080
Yeah.
38 points of damage.

1267
00:44:16.459 --> 00:44:19.520
(chuckles) It is done.
Oof,

1268
00:44:19.520 --> 00:44:21.520
does it explode or is it okay?

1269
00:44:21.520 --> 00:44:23.655
As you strike it, sshfck,

1270
00:44:23.655 --> 00:44:25.200
in the back of its head, it kinda (makes squishy noises)

1271
00:44:25.200 --> 00:44:26.530
falls forward onto its knees

1272
00:44:26.530 --> 00:44:28.734
and then its body (makes squelching noises)--

1273
00:44:28.734 --> 00:44:29.567
Oh no.

1274
00:44:29.567 --> 00:44:30.430
(groaning)

1275
00:44:30.430 --> 00:44:31.263
Bursts.

1276
00:44:31.263 --> 00:44:32.720
I need Beauregard, Caleb, and Fjord

1277
00:44:32.720 --> 00:44:35.474
to all make constitution saving throws, please.

1278
00:44:35.474 --> 00:44:37.370
(grumbling)

1279
00:44:37.370 --> 00:44:38.757
(dice clattering)

1280
00:44:38.757 --> 00:44:41.207
No, it's gonna happen.
This is how we do it.

1281
00:44:42.072 --> 00:44:43.680
Okay.
24.

1282
00:44:43.680 --> 00:44:45.800
24, success, you take 12 points of poison damage.

1283
00:44:45.800 --> 00:44:47.280
Oof.
20.

1284
00:44:47.280 --> 00:44:49.240
12 points of poison damage.

1285
00:44:49.240 --> 00:44:50.195
Caleb?

1286
00:44:50.195 --> 00:44:52.445
(mumbling)

1287
00:44:53.527 --> 00:44:55.960
I got some distance.
I'm, does my--

1288
00:44:55.960 --> 00:44:57.320
18.
18,

1289
00:44:57.320 --> 00:44:58.860
12 points of poison damage.
Does my immunity

1290
00:44:58.860 --> 00:45:00.240
to poison change anything?

1291
00:45:00.240 --> 00:45:01.460
Huh?
My immunity

1292
00:45:01.460 --> 00:45:02.810
to poison change anything or--

1293
00:45:02.810 --> 00:45:05.390
Immune to the condition or is it, this is your--

1294
00:45:06.640 --> 00:45:07.710
Monk shit.
I think, I think--

1295
00:45:07.710 --> 00:45:09.610
My monk shit.
I'll double check,

1296
00:45:09.610 --> 00:45:12.360
but I'm pretty sure maybe it's gonna do nothin' to ya.

1297
00:45:12.360 --> 00:45:15.280
I'm just gonna double check real fast here with your--

1298
00:45:15.280 --> 00:45:16.930
Monks have a lotta shit.

1299
00:45:16.930 --> 00:45:17.763
Yeah.
Yeah,

1300
00:45:17.763 --> 00:45:19.830
monks are pretty great.
They're awesome.

1301
00:45:19.830 --> 00:45:21.750
Immune to disease and poison.

1302
00:45:21.750 --> 00:45:23.090
Yeah, nothin'.

1303
00:45:23.090 --> 00:45:24.030
It hits you and you just

1304
00:45:24.030 --> 00:45:25.480
kinda, spshh, (clicks tongue).

1305
00:45:25.480 --> 00:45:26.690
Glisten.
Nothin'.

1306
00:45:26.690 --> 00:45:28.850
Your friends are dying.
Ooh, look at my guns.

1307
00:45:28.850 --> 00:45:30.708
They look good now.

1308
00:45:30.708 --> 00:45:31.740
(laughing)

1309
00:45:31.740 --> 00:45:34.475
Huh, interesting.
You are as thin as Gandhi.

1310
00:45:34.475 --> 00:45:36.730
Fuck you.
And then I will,

1311
00:45:36.730 --> 00:45:40.120
that one's within melee of me, so I will disengage--

1312
00:45:40.120 --> 00:45:41.780
Alrighty.
And, oh boy,

1313
00:45:41.780 --> 00:45:42.990
there's nowhere to run, we're surrounded,

1314
00:45:42.990 --> 00:45:46.620
but I'll, I'll, I'll just run away.

1315
00:45:46.620 --> 00:45:49.670
Okay, your movement is 35?
Yeah.

1316
00:45:50.800 --> 00:45:52.140
Yeah, I'll run back that way, yeah.

1317
00:45:52.140 --> 00:45:55.380
20, 25, 30, that's about as far as you can get.

1318
00:45:55.380 --> 00:45:57.460
That seems good.
Actually no,

1319
00:45:57.460 --> 00:45:58.330
you were on the kind of point there,

1320
00:45:58.330 --> 00:46:00.010
so you can actually get a little further if you want to,

1321
00:46:00.010 --> 00:46:02.020
over this way, just because you were on the--

1322
00:46:02.020 --> 00:46:02.853
Yeah, it's all good.

1323
00:46:02.853 --> 00:46:03.860
You were on the section that didn't have any swamp

1324
00:46:03.860 --> 00:46:04.693
and then you moved into the swamp.

1325
00:46:04.693 --> 00:46:06.240
There's a guy over there, I didn't see him.

1326
00:46:06.240 --> 00:46:07.883
Well you do now.
Oh, shit!

1327
00:46:07.883 --> 00:46:09.650
(laughing)

1328
00:46:09.650 --> 00:46:10.510
Okay, that's it.
All right.

1329
00:46:10.510 --> 00:46:11.850
Caduceus, you're up, Beau, you're on deck.

1330
00:46:11.850 --> 00:46:14.450
I'm gonna cast Bless at fourth level.

1331
00:46:14.450 --> 00:46:16.430
Ooh!
On everyone but Beau.

1332
00:46:17.310 --> 00:46:18.582
Damn, boy.

1333
00:46:18.582 --> 00:46:19.910
(laughing)

1334
00:46:19.910 --> 00:46:22.940
Everyone gets an extra D4 to attacks and saves.

1335
00:46:22.940 --> 00:46:24.180
Is that everyone's--
D4.

1336
00:46:24.180 --> 00:46:25.590
Confidence.
Has, yeah,

1337
00:46:25.590 --> 00:46:27.310
that much confidence in me.

1338
00:46:27.310 --> 00:46:29.030
So yeah, if you have to roll a save

1339
00:46:29.030 --> 00:46:31.450
or if you roll an attack, you can add a D4 to it.

1340
00:46:33.050 --> 00:46:35.690
Hashtag blessed.

1341
00:46:35.690 --> 00:46:37.860
Spell.
On me as well, or--

1342
00:46:37.860 --> 00:46:39.020
Yep.
Oh okay, cool.

1343
00:46:39.020 --> 00:46:41.350
Everyone's got a D--
Wait on me as well?

1344
00:46:41.350 --> 00:46:43.600
On you as well.
On little ol' me?

1345
00:46:43.600 --> 00:46:46.890
On little ol' me?
Even, yeah, everybody.

1346
00:46:46.890 --> 00:46:48.180
Alrighty, that's your action.

1347
00:46:48.180 --> 00:46:49.780
That's my action, I'm like, this is

1348
00:46:49.780 --> 00:46:51.290
where I am right now, oh boy.

1349
00:46:51.290 --> 00:46:53.560
Am I not engaged with any of them?

1350
00:46:53.560 --> 00:46:55.680
You were and then you blasted them back with your shield,

1351
00:46:55.680 --> 00:46:58.100
so you are not currently engaged with anything in combat.

1352
00:46:58.100 --> 00:47:01.470
Okay, I'm going to break off from the group a bit.

1353
00:47:01.470 --> 00:47:02.450
Okay.
'Cause I have just

1354
00:47:02.450 --> 00:47:04.950
figured out that this as a grouping is a disaster.

1355
00:47:06.292 --> 00:47:07.125
(laughing)

1356
00:47:07.125 --> 00:47:08.910
And I'm going to try and get to the other side

1357
00:47:08.910 --> 00:47:11.557
of this trunk over here, if that's okay.

1358
00:47:11.557 --> 00:47:14.320
5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, that's as far as you--

1359
00:47:14.320 --> 00:47:15.820
On the other side of it, if possible.

1360
00:47:15.820 --> 00:47:18.330
How long does Blessed last?
Until I lose concentration.

1361
00:47:18.330 --> 00:47:19.250
I'd say because you were in there,

1362
00:47:19.250 --> 00:47:20.750
I'll give you another block,

1363
00:47:20.750 --> 00:47:22.130
but that's as far as you can get.

1364
00:47:22.130 --> 00:47:23.310
I was--
Oh, the other side?

1365
00:47:23.310 --> 00:47:25.333
Oh, there's no way to get through there, yeah.

1366
00:47:25.333 --> 00:47:26.921
That's also rough terrain 'cause it's

1367
00:47:26.921 --> 00:47:27.754
a bunch of bunching, so I can

1368
00:47:27.754 --> 00:47:28.590
meet you about there.
I'm getting in there--

1369
00:47:28.590 --> 00:47:31.720
And you are partially hidden by a bush.

1370
00:47:33.569 --> 00:47:35.195
There you go, you're good, you're good.

1371
00:47:35.195 --> 00:47:36.028
There we go.
Or there, too.

1372
00:47:36.028 --> 00:47:37.700
That works fine, sure, wherever you wanna go, Caduceus.

1373
00:47:37.700 --> 00:47:39.970
That's right, I'm trying to be our back up against that.

1374
00:47:39.970 --> 00:47:40.803
All right.
There we go,

1375
00:47:40.803 --> 00:47:42.350
if that's real stuff.
There you go.

1376
00:47:42.350 --> 00:47:43.990
Oh boy.

1377
00:47:43.990 --> 00:47:45.310
Yeah, that's, I don't think I have

1378
00:47:45.310 --> 00:47:46.720
a bonus action so yeah, that's--

1379
00:47:46.720 --> 00:47:48.360
Beauregard, you're up.
All right.

1380
00:47:48.360 --> 00:47:52.600
Caleb, you're on deck.
I have zombie Jesus here.

1381
00:47:52.600 --> 00:47:54.260
Zombie Jesus?
(chuckles) Sure.

1382
00:47:54.260 --> 00:47:56.100
And then that guy?
Yes.

1383
00:47:56.100 --> 00:48:00.590
I'm going to elbow the guy behind me

1384
00:48:00.590 --> 00:48:04.230
and then give a nice roundhouse to the guy up front,

1385
00:48:04.230 --> 00:48:05.063
I don't know.
Go for it.

1386
00:48:05.063 --> 00:48:06.170
So, one attack to each?
One to each.

1387
00:48:06.170 --> 00:48:07.345
You got it.

1388
00:48:07.345 --> 00:48:08.945
(dice clattering)

1389
00:48:08.945 --> 00:48:09.950
Wow, wow, that's real bad.

1390
00:48:09.950 --> 00:48:11.420
Bad rolls.
Real bad.

1391
00:48:11.420 --> 00:48:13.750
13 and a 15.
Both hit.

1392
00:48:13.750 --> 00:48:14.820
Wow!

1393
00:48:15.720 --> 00:48:18.240
Anyone can hit these guys.
Yeah.

1394
00:48:18.240 --> 00:48:19.600
What'd you roll?
Awesome!

1395
00:48:19.600 --> 00:48:21.990
I rolled a three and a five and I still hit both of them.

1396
00:48:21.990 --> 00:48:24.010
Wow.
What was the total?

1397
00:48:24.010 --> 00:48:26.070
Pop pop, 13 and 15.
Okay, okay.

1398
00:48:26.070 --> 00:48:28.000
They might be a little bit--

1399
00:48:28.000 --> 00:48:31.000
So, that's gonna be eight to the guy

1400
00:48:31.000 --> 00:48:32.330
in the back--
Alrighty.

1401
00:48:32.330 --> 00:48:33.550
10 to the guy in the front.

1402
00:48:33.550 --> 00:48:36.049
Bum bum ba dip a dup ah.

1403
00:48:36.049 --> 00:48:39.320
(dramatic music)

1404
00:48:39.320 --> 00:48:42.370
Still standin'?
What was the second damage?

1405
00:48:42.370 --> 00:48:44.270
It was--
Ten, eight and ten.

1406
00:48:44.270 --> 00:48:45.740
Yeah, those still standin', no issue.

1407
00:48:45.740 --> 00:48:48.244
They both take hits, da-gsh, and they're like (growls).

1408
00:48:48.244 --> 00:48:50.450
It doesn't seem to be that much of an impact on them.

1409
00:48:50.450 --> 00:48:52.007
Oh, no I've got a bunch of--

1410
00:48:52.007 --> 00:48:52.840
(sneezing)

1411
00:48:52.840 --> 00:48:53.720
Pardon me.
Bless you.

1412
00:48:53.720 --> 00:48:54.553
Gesundheit.

1413
00:48:54.553 --> 00:48:55.386
(sneezing)

1414
00:48:55.386 --> 00:48:56.219
Bless you.

1415
00:48:56.219 --> 00:48:57.052
(singing)

1416
00:48:57.052 --> 00:48:57.885
(sneezing)

1417
00:48:57.885 --> 00:48:58.829
(cheering)

1418
00:48:58.829 --> 00:49:00.170
A triple sneezer?

1419
00:49:00.170 --> 00:49:01.260
They're usually triple sneezers.

1420
00:49:01.260 --> 00:49:02.160
So it might--
Ah.

1421
00:49:02.160 --> 00:49:04.427
Gotta triple sneeze.
What doesn't seem to, okay.

1422
00:49:04.427 --> 00:49:05.260
(laughing)

1423
00:49:05.260 --> 00:49:06.093
Okay.

1424
00:49:06.093 --> 00:49:06.926
Lucky.

1425
00:49:06.926 --> 00:49:08.383
(laughing)

1426
00:49:08.383 --> 00:49:10.640
Why don't you brag about it?

1427
00:49:10.640 --> 00:49:12.610
Flurry of Blows.
Flurry of Blows?

1428
00:49:12.610 --> 00:49:14.980
All right.
Same thing, one each.

1429
00:49:14.980 --> 00:49:16.080
Pop pop, you got it.

1430
00:49:17.180 --> 00:49:19.130
Both hit with a 15 and a 17.

1431
00:49:19.130 --> 00:49:21.970
Yup.
Oh, those are better.

1432
00:49:21.970 --> 00:49:24.230
18 to the guy in the back.
Nice.

1433
00:49:24.230 --> 00:49:28.280
And, nope, sorry, sorry, let me rethink that.

1434
00:49:29.410 --> 00:49:32.500
14 to the guy in the back.
14 to the guy in the back.

1435
00:49:32.500 --> 00:49:34.140
That's eight plus six, right?

1436
00:49:34.140 --> 00:49:35.080
Correct.
Yes?

1437
00:49:35.080 --> 00:49:37.150
And then--
To zombie Jesus?

1438
00:49:38.273 --> 00:49:39.573
To zombie Jesus and then

1439
00:49:41.050 --> 00:49:43.720
12 to the guy in the front.
Alrighty.

1440
00:49:43.720 --> 00:49:45.910
Crack crack, you hit them both again.

1441
00:49:45.910 --> 00:49:47.700
They both kinda (grunts) bow back

1442
00:49:47.700 --> 00:49:49.590
and they're looking hurt but they're

1443
00:49:49.590 --> 00:49:52.010
still standing angrily, growling, on each side of you.

1444
00:49:52.010 --> 00:49:54.350
You do, however, get your Extract Aspects on them.

1445
00:49:54.350 --> 00:49:58.060
They are, surprisingly, immune to poison and being poisoned.

1446
00:49:58.060 --> 00:50:00.130
Makes sense.
That's not surprising.

1447
00:50:00.130 --> 00:50:01.720
I know.
"They're immune to

1448
00:50:01.720 --> 00:50:03.850
"the shit that they throw on us.

1449
00:50:03.850 --> 00:50:06.200
"They're immune to poison," I say to everybody.

1450
00:50:07.350 --> 00:50:09.240
Tell me what to do, Sam.
All right, that's my turn.

1451
00:50:09.240 --> 00:50:10.220
You got it, Beau. Caleb, you're up.

1452
00:50:10.220 --> 00:50:13.790
Jester, you're on deck.
So the nega-Widogast

1453
00:50:13.790 --> 00:50:16.610
pulls his hands apart and a giant fireball

1454
00:50:16.610 --> 00:50:18.530
opens up in his hands and he chucks it

1455
00:50:19.660 --> 00:50:20.960
over to here.
Alrighty.

1456
00:50:23.927 --> 00:50:24.942
(chuckling)

1457
00:50:24.942 --> 00:50:26.110
Over in this direction so that we can hopefully

1458
00:50:26.110 --> 00:50:29.470
catch himself and these two buddies and this one here.

1459
00:50:29.470 --> 00:50:30.970
Yeah, you can get all three of those.

1460
00:50:30.970 --> 00:50:32.000
And himself.
And himself!

1461
00:50:32.000 --> 00:50:34.020
He will disappear.
It's a fireball?

1462
00:50:34.020 --> 00:50:34.853
Yeah.
Go ahead

1463
00:50:34.853 --> 00:50:35.850
and roll damage on that.

1464
00:50:35.850 --> 00:50:37.820
Now, where's that thing, where did it go?

1465
00:50:37.820 --> 00:50:39.200
There it is.

1466
00:50:39.200 --> 00:50:41.500
Okay, that's a fail.
I am gonna,

1467
00:50:41.500 --> 00:50:43.500
hell, it's all gonna fail, oh listening.

1468
00:50:44.410 --> 00:50:46.010
Took here, took a roll.

1469
00:50:46.010 --> 00:50:48.340
That, I gotta re-roll it 'cause it was,

1470
00:50:48.340 --> 00:50:50.468
these dice, I can't do it.

1471
00:50:50.468 --> 00:50:52.718
(giggling)

1472
00:50:53.714 --> 00:50:56.750
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight.

1473
00:50:56.750 --> 00:50:57.826
Here we go.

1474
00:50:57.826 --> 00:50:59.510
(dice clattering)

1475
00:50:59.510 --> 00:51:00.981
11, 13,

1476
00:51:00.981 --> 00:51:02.700
17, 21,

1477
00:51:02.700 --> 00:51:03.640
27,

1478
00:51:03.640 --> 00:51:04.580
33,

1479
00:51:05.630 --> 00:51:07.580
34.

1480
00:51:08.900 --> 00:51:11.600
Plus the plus the plus the plus the--

1481
00:51:11.600 --> 00:51:13.455
Just shift your position.

1482
00:51:13.455 --> 00:51:14.288
Plus the,

1483
00:51:14.288 --> 00:51:17.270
(laughing)

1484
00:51:17.270 --> 00:51:19.370
34.
34 points of damage?

1485
00:51:19.370 --> 00:51:22.320
Yeah, high rolls.
That's actually really good.

1486
00:51:23.460 --> 00:51:24.510
The two, so yeah.

1487
00:51:25.900 --> 00:51:28.790
Caleb, the echo Caleb releases it

1488
00:51:28.790 --> 00:51:31.830
and just, hshh, scatters into shadow and is gone

1489
00:51:31.830 --> 00:51:33.970
as the flaming blast lights up the space around you

1490
00:51:33.970 --> 00:51:34.870
in the middle of this dark kind of

1491
00:51:34.870 --> 00:51:37.170
barely moonlit center of the swamp.

1492
00:51:37.170 --> 00:51:39.640
As the zombies themselves take the flame

1493
00:51:39.640 --> 00:51:40.770
and kinda scramble for a minute,

1494
00:51:40.770 --> 00:51:42.830
kind of caught off guard by the blast,

1495
00:51:42.830 --> 00:51:44.980
they all get back to their place.

1496
00:51:44.980 --> 00:51:46.960
This one here looks hurt,

1497
00:51:46.960 --> 00:51:49.378
the other two are almost destroyed.

1498
00:51:49.378 --> 00:51:51.890
Whatever flesh that was soggy and green

1499
00:51:51.890 --> 00:51:54.520
is now black and crispy, they've lost most of

1500
00:51:54.520 --> 00:51:55.829
their facial features and they're just like

1501
00:51:55.829 --> 00:51:57.980
(gasps) but they're still standing.

1502
00:51:57.980 --> 00:52:00.820
And also, Caleb turns into a giant ape.

1503
00:52:00.820 --> 00:52:02.140
Oh, okay, that works, too.

1504
00:52:02.140 --> 00:52:03.090
Ooh.
Oh, okay.

1505
00:52:04.552 --> 00:52:05.385
(chuckling)

1506
00:52:05.385 --> 00:52:06.218
Turn into what, a giant ape?

1507
00:52:06.218 --> 00:52:07.337
Yeah.
Woo!

1508
00:52:07.337 --> 00:52:08.277
We're monkeyin' around.

1509
00:52:11.330 --> 00:52:12.340
All right.

1510
00:52:12.340 --> 00:52:14.780
So with that, you are now a blessed monkey.

1511
00:52:16.610 --> 00:52:18.020
Hashtag blessed.
Yes.

1512
00:52:18.020 --> 00:52:21.520
And you get kind of shunted out to this space

1513
00:52:21.520 --> 00:52:22.730
since you cannot occupy the space

1514
00:52:22.730 --> 00:52:23.920
the rest of your group is there.

1515
00:52:23.920 --> 00:52:25.910
And you're a giant monkey, that's your action.

1516
00:52:25.910 --> 00:52:26.743
Alrighty.

1517
00:52:28.269 --> 00:52:29.307
Is that your turn, are you gonna stay there?

1518
00:52:29.307 --> 00:52:30.220
(grunting)

1519
00:52:30.220 --> 00:52:31.350
(chuckles) You got it.

1520
00:52:31.350 --> 00:52:32.183
Jester, you're up.

1521
00:52:32.183 --> 00:52:33.410
Fjord, you're on deck.
Okay.

1522
00:52:34.270 --> 00:52:36.800
I am going to--
This is it.

1523
00:52:36.800 --> 00:52:37.633
I know.

1524
00:52:37.633 --> 00:52:38.580
I'm going to reach into my bag

1525
00:52:38.580 --> 00:52:42.030
and pull out the diamond that Caleb gave me

1526
00:52:42.030 --> 00:52:45.380
that I used to incite greed and I'm gonna hold it

1527
00:52:45.380 --> 00:52:49.580
high in the air and I'm gonna cast Incite Greed.

1528
00:52:49.580 --> 00:52:51.250
Okay.
Incite Greed.

1529
00:52:51.250 --> 00:52:54.650
Any creature that I choose within 30 feet of me,

1530
00:52:54.650 --> 00:52:56.460
which should be all of them except for that skeleton

1531
00:52:56.460 --> 00:52:59.280
and this guy over here, has to make a

1532
00:52:59.280 --> 00:53:01.420
wisdom saving throw.
Correct.

1533
00:53:02.530 --> 00:53:05.330
So, those two on the outside are exempt.

1534
00:53:05.330 --> 00:53:06.897
That guy there.

1535
00:53:06.897 --> 00:53:07.730
(dice clattering)

1536
00:53:07.730 --> 00:53:08.960
Failure.

1537
00:53:08.960 --> 00:53:10.150
Dude next to Fjord.

1538
00:53:12.000 --> 00:53:13.580
16.
Fail.

1539
00:53:13.580 --> 00:53:14.413
Fail.

1540
00:53:15.920 --> 00:53:16.990
17.
Fail.

1541
00:53:16.990 --> 00:53:19.650
Ah, 17 he needs, 17.
So, this guy does succeed.

1542
00:53:19.650 --> 00:53:20.720
Okay.
There's nothing.

1543
00:53:20.720 --> 00:53:22.280
He's fine on that.
I got him.

1544
00:53:22.280 --> 00:53:23.682
The one next to Beau.

1545
00:53:23.682 --> 00:53:24.515
(dice clattering)

1546
00:53:24.515 --> 00:53:25.380
Fail.

1547
00:53:25.380 --> 00:53:27.937
The two next to Yasha, fail.

1548
00:53:27.937 --> 00:53:28.770
(dice clattering)

1549
00:53:28.770 --> 00:53:29.740
Fail, no, he succeeds.

1550
00:53:29.740 --> 00:53:31.170
He rolled an 18.
Okay.

1551
00:53:32.050 --> 00:53:33.190
They have a penalty, though,

1552
00:53:33.190 --> 00:53:34.620
but they're still rolling pretty high.

1553
00:53:34.620 --> 00:53:37.530
So, this guy, this guy, and those two are unaffected.

1554
00:53:37.530 --> 00:53:39.151
The two that are next to you, Jester.

1555
00:53:39.151 --> 00:53:39.984
(dice clattering)

1556
00:53:39.984 --> 00:53:42.300
Fail and fail.

1557
00:53:42.300 --> 00:53:43.580
What?
What happens?

1558
00:53:45.320 --> 00:53:47.360
They have to use their entire turn

1559
00:53:47.360 --> 00:53:49.870
to do nothing but move towards me.

1560
00:53:49.870 --> 00:53:51.300
If they are within five feet of me,

1561
00:53:51.300 --> 00:53:53.110
it can't do anything but stare greedily

1562
00:53:53.110 --> 00:53:54.400
at the gem that I'm holding up.

1563
00:53:54.400 --> 00:53:56.100
Whoa.
They all want this gem

1564
00:53:56.100 --> 00:53:58.000
very badly.
And it's concentration?

1565
00:54:00.288 --> 00:54:01.710
It is.
Alrighty.

1566
00:54:03.517 --> 00:54:07.020
And at the end of their turn, they get to make

1567
00:54:07.020 --> 00:54:08.820
a wisdom save again.
You got it.

1568
00:54:08.820 --> 00:54:09.830
Okay, good to know, Jester.

1569
00:54:09.830 --> 00:54:10.780
Wow.
Thank you.

1570
00:54:10.780 --> 00:54:13.150
Fjord, you're up.
That's, that's amazing.

1571
00:54:15.030 --> 00:54:16.810
If you guys hurt them, it ends the charm effect,

1572
00:54:16.810 --> 00:54:18.460
it's like a charm, so only attack

1573
00:54:18.460 --> 00:54:19.880
the ones that aren't charmed right now.

1574
00:54:19.880 --> 00:54:21.480
Got it.
Wow.

1575
00:54:21.480 --> 00:54:25.130
Can I use my bonus action to put my Hex Blades curse

1576
00:54:25.130 --> 00:54:28.330
on this individual over here that has

1577
00:54:28.330 --> 00:54:30.840
the very large hat?
You got it.

1578
00:54:32.306 --> 00:54:34.470
And I will take two swings with

1579
00:54:34.470 --> 00:54:37.270
the Star Razor at that unaffected--

1580
00:54:37.270 --> 00:54:39.540
Right here?
Gentleman, yes.

1581
00:54:39.540 --> 00:54:41.744
Go for it. (claps)
Is that one--

1582
00:54:41.744 --> 00:54:42.577
Two strikes at that one?

1583
00:54:42.577 --> 00:54:43.410
Yes.
Alrighty.

1584
00:54:44.320 --> 00:54:47.222
And I'll use that, the word to make it glow.

1585
00:54:47.222 --> 00:54:48.440
(dice clattering)

1586
00:54:48.440 --> 00:54:50.840
So, vvv, the runes light up, the blade gives off

1587
00:54:50.840 --> 00:54:53.560
this bright radiant kind of a light

1588
00:54:53.560 --> 00:54:56.450
that just emanates from the edge and you swing, wsh--

1589
00:54:56.450 --> 00:54:58.220
27.
That hits.

1590
00:54:58.220 --> 00:55:00.290
Second one is--
Woo, c'mon Fjordy.

1591
00:55:00.290 --> 00:55:02.270
Wow.
28 to hit.

1592
00:55:02.270 --> 00:55:03.103
Both hit.

1593
00:55:03.103 --> 00:55:04.230
Go and roll damage on that one.

1594
00:55:05.508 --> 00:55:08.296
Good, I didn't even roll the fuckin' plus, whatever.

1595
00:55:08.296 --> 00:55:09.129
(laughing)

1596
00:55:09.129 --> 00:55:11.177
10, wait a minute.

1597
00:55:11.177 --> 00:55:13.870
(dice clattering)

1598
00:55:13.870 --> 00:55:17.240
11 points of damage and 19.

1599
00:55:17.240 --> 00:55:21.410
So, 29 points of slashing damage.

1600
00:55:21.410 --> 00:55:22.960
29 to the one that was unwounded

1601
00:55:22.960 --> 00:55:25.464
right there.
Yes, unaffected.

1602
00:55:25.464 --> 00:55:27.700
(makes slashing noises) Both strikes carve through.

1603
00:55:27.700 --> 00:55:30.070
Where the blade carves into its flesh, it opens up

1604
00:55:30.070 --> 00:55:32.410
and you can see the radiant energy sears through.

1605
00:55:32.410 --> 00:55:35.530
There's no roughness to it, it just almost

1606
00:55:35.530 --> 00:55:37.470
burns straight through like it was

1607
00:55:37.470 --> 00:55:40.551
just an incise laser had carved.

1608
00:55:40.551 --> 00:55:42.400
Nice.
It's still standing,

1609
00:55:42.400 --> 00:55:45.150
though really, really badly hurt and barely holding on.

1610
00:55:46.220 --> 00:55:48.930
That's your action and your bonus.

1611
00:55:48.930 --> 00:55:50.970
And my bonus was the Hex Blades, yes.

1612
00:55:50.970 --> 00:55:52.300
So, you gonna move or stay put?

1613
00:55:52.300 --> 00:55:53.220
Yes, I stay put.
All right.

1614
00:55:53.220 --> 00:55:54.642
Top of the round.

1615
00:55:54.642 --> 00:55:55.475
Yasha, you're up next.
Okay.

1616
00:55:55.475 --> 00:55:58.270
You are currently surrounded, though both, one of them,

1617
00:55:58.270 --> 00:56:02.010
who's behind you, went from (growls) to (gasps)

1618
00:56:02.010 --> 00:56:03.690
and just staring over towards Jester

1619
00:56:03.690 --> 00:56:04.880
while the one that's immediately in front of you

1620
00:56:04.880 --> 00:56:06.060
is still thrashing towards you.

1621
00:56:06.060 --> 00:56:07.370
Okay, since he's distracted,

1622
00:56:07.370 --> 00:56:09.210
I'm gonna go for the one in front of me.

1623
00:56:09.210 --> 00:56:12.430
Oh zombies, I have a very pretty gem!

1624
00:56:12.430 --> 00:56:14.120
17.
17 hits.

1625
00:56:14.120 --> 00:56:16.902
Okay.
Butterflies.

1626
00:56:16.902 --> 00:56:17.735
(dice clattering)

1627
00:56:17.735 --> 00:56:20.080
First hit, I'll take that.

1628
00:56:21.650 --> 00:56:22.660
5, 11,

1629
00:56:22.660 --> 00:56:24.260
21.

1630
00:56:24.260 --> 00:56:26.780
21 points of damage?
21 points of damage.

1631
00:56:26.780 --> 00:56:28.310
Ooh, nice.
Oh look, a deer.

1632
00:56:28.310 --> 00:56:29.905
Second strike.
Second hit.

1633
00:56:29.905 --> 00:56:30.800
(sighs) It's gonna explode on me.

1634
00:56:30.800 --> 00:56:33.090
Zombie deer.
A zombie deer.

1635
00:56:33.090 --> 00:56:34.840
The deer's like (growls).
12.

1636
00:56:34.840 --> 00:56:35.920
Also hits.
It does?

1637
00:56:35.920 --> 00:56:37.540
What, 12 still hits?
Yes!

1638
00:56:38.463 --> 00:56:39.296
All right.
They don't have

1639
00:56:39.296 --> 00:56:40.690
a great armor class.
These guys suck.

1640
00:56:40.690 --> 00:56:41.840
Okay.
Shut up.

1641
00:56:41.840 --> 00:56:43.830
I'm gonna try rolling this again since I didn't

1642
00:56:43.830 --> 00:56:45.870
on the last one.
Go for it.

1643
00:56:45.870 --> 00:56:48.180
That's same, okay, so five,

1644
00:56:50.930 --> 00:56:53.100
12 points of damage.
12 points of damage.

1645
00:56:53.100 --> 00:56:55.110
All right, you attack twice, as it (makes slicing noise)

1646
00:56:55.110 --> 00:56:56.410
and then (grunts) carve upward

1647
00:56:56.410 --> 00:56:58.520
and you watch it actually carve through the face

1648
00:56:58.520 --> 00:56:59.830
and the head splits a bit

1649
00:57:00.823 --> 00:57:02.210
but one of the eyes kinda looks back to you

1650
00:57:02.210 --> 00:57:04.230
and it's kinda shambling towards you,

1651
00:57:04.230 --> 00:57:06.380
almost like, the second future reference,

1652
00:57:06.380 --> 00:57:09.370
like a T-1000 kinda split open coming in your direction.

1653
00:57:09.370 --> 00:57:10.203
(clapping)

1654
00:57:10.203 --> 00:57:12.200
Oh, yes.
It's just like in--

1655
00:57:12.200 --> 00:57:13.750
You still have your bonus and your movement

1656
00:57:13.750 --> 00:57:15.693
if you wanna do anything or are you gonna stay put?

1657
00:57:15.693 --> 00:57:17.220
(groaning)

1658
00:57:17.220 --> 00:57:18.780
Um, okay, um,

1659
00:57:19.836 --> 00:57:22.151
(inhaling)

1660
00:57:22.151 --> 00:57:23.920
oh, you know what I'm gonna do?

1661
00:57:23.920 --> 00:57:25.470
Whatcha gonna do?

1662
00:57:25.470 --> 00:57:27.110
Is--

1663
00:57:27.110 --> 00:57:29.081
Whatcha gonna do with all this--

1664
00:57:29.081 --> 00:57:30.574
(laughing)

1665
00:57:30.574 --> 00:57:31.407
Okay.

1666
00:57:31.407 --> 00:57:32.240
I thought you were gonna say,

1667
00:57:32.240 --> 00:57:33.340
"Whatcha gonna do when you get outta jail?

1668
00:57:33.340 --> 00:57:34.500
"I'm gonna have some fun."

1669
00:57:34.500 --> 00:57:36.820
I'm going to use Zealous Presence.

1670
00:57:36.820 --> 00:57:37.653
Ooh yeah.

1671
00:57:39.091 --> 00:57:41.820
And it's a bonus action, this is for everybody.

1672
00:57:41.820 --> 00:57:44.980
I'll unleash a battle cry and up to 10 other creatures,

1673
00:57:45.900 --> 00:57:48.270
all of you guys, you gain advantage

1674
00:57:48.270 --> 00:57:50.098
on attack rolls and saving throws.

1675
00:57:50.098 --> 00:57:51.548
Oh!

1676
00:57:51.548 --> 00:57:52.590
Until next round, right?
Until the start of

1677
00:57:52.590 --> 00:57:53.600
your next turn.
Right.

1678
00:57:53.600 --> 00:57:54.880
Oh, so the start of your next turn.

1679
00:57:54.880 --> 00:57:56.647
'Til the start of my next turn.

1680
00:57:56.647 --> 00:57:57.826
Awesome.
So, this round--

1681
00:57:57.826 --> 00:57:58.880
So, you strike twice, the guy doesn't go down

1682
00:57:58.880 --> 00:58:00.170
and starts lumbering angrily towards you,

1683
00:58:00.170 --> 00:58:03.430
you just go (roars) and you just give out

1684
00:58:03.430 --> 00:58:05.840
this piercing fallen angel scream

1685
00:58:05.840 --> 00:58:08.170
that echoes through the middle of this swamp.

1686
00:58:09.040 --> 00:58:11.260
You guys hear this, as the echo kind of

1687
00:58:11.260 --> 00:58:13.890
cha-kch-kch, you hear (makes thunder noises).

1688
00:58:15.830 --> 00:58:19.310
A stormless sky, yet you hear thunder rolling

1689
00:58:19.310 --> 00:58:21.669
and a flash in the distance as the Storm Lord--

1690
00:58:21.669 --> 00:58:24.680
(excitedly talking over each other)

1691
00:58:24.680 --> 00:58:26.940
It's within 60 feet.
That's all of them.

1692
00:58:26.940 --> 00:58:28.660
That's everybody? Okay, great.

1693
00:58:28.660 --> 00:58:31.510
Finished your go?
That'll be my go.

1694
00:58:31.510 --> 00:58:33.282
All right, it's their turn.

1695
00:58:33.282 --> 00:58:34.115
That's a real good go.

1696
00:58:34.115 --> 00:58:34.970
This guy's just gonna run right over

1697
00:58:34.970 --> 00:58:36.970
to Jester and this guy's gonna stay put.

1698
00:58:38.249 --> 00:58:39.490
I forgot about that.

1699
00:58:39.490 --> 00:58:42.140
This guy's gonna, I think, yeah,

1700
00:58:42.140 --> 00:58:45.430
this guy moves in and tries to push past.

1701
00:58:45.430 --> 00:58:47.730
Oh my god, this is terrifying.

1702
00:58:47.730 --> 00:58:48.670
That's as far as they can

1703
00:58:48.670 --> 00:58:51.240
get there.
Like the visual.

1704
00:58:52.165 --> 00:58:53.890
That one's not affected.
No, he's not affected

1705
00:58:53.890 --> 00:58:55.490
but the next, yeah, that guy is.

1706
00:58:56.560 --> 00:58:58.180
Do we get attacks of opportunity?

1707
00:58:58.180 --> 00:59:00.140
Fjord does.
That guy was affected.

1708
00:59:00.140 --> 00:59:01.950
But if we, we can hold it if we want to.

1709
00:59:01.950 --> 00:59:02.783
Yeah.
Yeah.

1710
00:59:02.783 --> 00:59:03.880
Okay.
If you hit one--

1711
00:59:03.880 --> 00:59:05.110
Correct.
It doesn't break on all,

1712
00:59:05.110 --> 00:59:06.040
does it?
No.

1713
00:59:06.040 --> 00:59:06.873
It just breaks on the one.

1714
00:59:06.873 --> 00:59:08.470
So you're not given to opportunity?

1715
00:59:09.342 --> 00:59:12.550
I'm gonna listen to--
One, two, three, four.

1716
00:59:12.550 --> 00:59:14.380
Yeah, can get right there.
What about

1717
00:59:14.380 --> 00:59:16.000
that little guy over by the tree?

1718
00:59:16.000 --> 00:59:17.100
Right here?
Yeah.

1719
00:59:18.673 --> 00:59:20.363
(whimpering)

1720
00:59:20.363 --> 00:59:22.306
Four, that's as far as he gets there.

1721
00:59:22.306 --> 00:59:23.480
(shuddering)

1722
00:59:23.480 --> 00:59:25.020
All right, so they just all kinda move forward.

1723
00:59:25.020 --> 00:59:25.930
All of a sudden--
Those two are unaffected?

1724
00:59:25.930 --> 00:59:27.320
Yeah.
Those two are unaffected

1725
00:59:27.320 --> 00:59:29.175
and that, so three of them are unaffected currently.

1726
00:59:29.175 --> 00:59:31.140
So Jester, you watch them all swarm

1727
00:59:31.140 --> 00:59:35.910
and you hear this kind of, this whole chorus of (groans).

1728
00:59:36.960 --> 00:59:38.260
You look around you and they're all just

1729
00:59:38.260 --> 00:59:40.860
glaring in your direction, some with both eyes,

1730
00:59:40.860 --> 00:59:43.480
some with the one eye they have, some with no eyes

1731
00:59:43.480 --> 00:59:44.960
but the very force that holds them together

1732
00:59:44.960 --> 00:59:48.420
through necrotic arcane terrible magic

1733
00:59:48.420 --> 00:59:50.530
that rocks into this swamp is still looking

1734
00:59:50.530 --> 00:59:53.210
right in your direction and it's not fun.

1735
00:59:53.210 --> 00:59:54.800
Help.
The one that's

1736
00:59:54.800 --> 00:59:56.470
still upon you that's kinda pulled apart

1737
00:59:56.470 --> 00:59:57.690
is gonna go ahead and strike you twice,

1738
00:59:57.690 --> 00:59:59.062
Yasha.
'Kay.

1739
00:59:59.062 --> 01:00:01.041
(dice clattering)

1740
01:00:01.041 --> 01:00:03.740
Ah, natural one and an 18.
That hits.

1741
01:00:03.740 --> 01:00:05.397
All right, so you do take

1742
01:00:05.397 --> 01:00:06.230
(dice clattering)

1743
01:00:06.230 --> 01:00:08.240
five points of slashing damage, reduced to two

1744
01:00:08.240 --> 01:00:10.250
because you're raging.
Tight.

1745
01:00:10.250 --> 01:00:12.430
Fjord, two attacks against you.

1746
01:00:12.430 --> 01:00:14.250
All right.
And this one's gonna

1747
01:00:14.250 --> 01:00:16.350
go ahead and move in a bit to about there,

1748
01:00:16.350 --> 01:00:19.170
kinda fill the gap between the three of you and

1749
01:00:21.460 --> 01:00:23.560
yup, it's gonna go ahead and take two strikes against you.

1750
01:00:23.560 --> 01:00:24.621
All right.

1751
01:00:24.621 --> 01:00:25.764
(dice clattering)

1752
01:00:25.764 --> 01:00:26.802
(clicks tongue) That's cocked, Harry.

1753
01:00:26.802 --> 01:00:27.760
(dice clattering)

1754
01:00:27.760 --> 01:00:28.660
Okay, there we go.

1755
01:00:30.564 --> 01:00:33.830
Ah, an eight and a 21.
21 hits.

1756
01:00:33.830 --> 01:00:34.663
(dice clattering)

1757
01:00:34.663 --> 01:00:36.340
Oh, that was a cock in that one.

1758
01:00:36.340 --> 01:00:38.650
Ooh, eight points of slashing damage on that one.

1759
01:00:38.650 --> 01:00:41.580
And he will take seven points of radiant damage as the

1760
01:00:41.580 --> 01:00:44.770
sword bursts with radiant energy each time I'm struck.

1761
01:00:45.850 --> 01:00:49.390
As it hits him, kshh, he rushes past.

1762
01:00:49.390 --> 01:00:53.030
The impact of that radiant energy burns up the back

1763
01:00:53.030 --> 01:00:55.160
and you see the neck itself kind of snap from

1764
01:00:55.160 --> 01:00:57.090
the tendons that are no longer holding it up,

1765
01:00:57.090 --> 01:00:59.960
it's kinda (makes creaking noise) dangles there

1766
01:00:59.960 --> 01:01:02.331
and the mouth kinda goes (growls).

1767
01:01:02.331 --> 01:01:04.910
Oh my, what?
It's hanging on by a thread.

1768
01:01:04.910 --> 01:01:06.540
That's so cool.
Yeah.

1769
01:01:08.158 --> 01:01:10.778
And then this one here is gonna rush over to you, Nott,

1770
01:01:10.778 --> 01:01:11.611
(screaming)

1771
01:01:11.611 --> 01:01:12.444
around the corner and make two strikes

1772
01:01:12.444 --> 01:01:14.156
against you.
No!

1773
01:01:14.156 --> 01:01:15.200
(dice clattering)

1774
01:01:15.200 --> 01:01:16.450
Oh shit.

1775
01:01:16.450 --> 01:01:18.040
Uh--
Shit.

1776
01:01:18.040 --> 01:01:20.267
20 and a natural 20.

1777
01:01:20.267 --> 01:01:21.734
(groaning)

1778
01:01:21.734 --> 01:01:22.567
Well, it hit.
Dang.

1779
01:01:22.567 --> 01:01:24.890
That I can, I can counter the natural 20 on that one,

1780
01:01:24.890 --> 01:01:26.530
though, 'cause I still have, now I have a reaction--

1781
01:01:26.530 --> 01:01:28.780
New turn.
You do,

1782
01:01:28.780 --> 01:01:29.730
now you do, yes.
Yeah.

1783
01:01:29.730 --> 01:01:31.450
So, no natural, no crit on you.

1784
01:01:31.450 --> 01:01:33.139
Okay.
Gimme a snap.

1785
01:01:33.139 --> 01:01:33.972
(snapping)

1786
01:01:33.972 --> 01:01:35.570
Technically, you woulda got your

1787
01:01:35.570 --> 01:01:38.743
reaction back 'cause you got your turn--

1788
01:01:38.743 --> 01:01:40.200
It was in the same turn, the last time.

1789
01:01:40.200 --> 01:01:41.801
No, you're right, you're right.

1790
01:01:41.801 --> 01:01:42.634
Yeah.
So--

1791
01:01:42.634 --> 01:01:43.488
We're cool.
Yeah yeah,

1792
01:01:43.488 --> 01:01:45.426
I was making sure, anyway, it's fine, you can do it.

1793
01:01:45.426 --> 01:01:46.370
(laughing)

1794
01:01:46.370 --> 01:01:48.620
So it's just two damage.
Lemme mark that.

1795
01:01:48.620 --> 01:01:49.540
That is

1796
01:01:51.920 --> 01:01:55.500
11 points of slashing damage to you, Nott.

1797
01:01:55.500 --> 01:01:58.240
For both or just the first?
For both.

1798
01:01:58.240 --> 01:02:00.190
Oh, okay.
Not as much

1799
01:02:00.190 --> 01:02:03.590
'cause the crit got canceled by Caduceus there.

1800
01:02:04.450 --> 01:02:05.880
That finishes their turn.

1801
01:02:05.880 --> 01:02:07.320
That brings us to Nott, you're up.

1802
01:02:07.320 --> 01:02:09.050
Caduceus, you're on deck.
Oh boy.

1803
01:02:09.050 --> 01:02:12.590
I'm stuck in front of this fellow, I don't like it.

1804
01:02:15.062 --> 01:02:16.160
Well, I can't do what I wanted to do,

1805
01:02:16.160 --> 01:02:20.360
so I will say, "Fjord, cover your eyes!"

1806
01:02:20.360 --> 01:02:23.520
And I will fire through the one in front of me at the one

1807
01:02:23.520 --> 01:02:25.400
engaged with Fjord.
Okay.

1808
01:02:28.138 --> 01:02:29.784
(dice clattering)

1809
01:02:29.784 --> 01:02:30.617
What'd you roll?
15.

1810
01:02:30.617 --> 01:02:32.820
15, that'll hit, go to roll damage.

1811
01:02:32.820 --> 01:02:35.810
As it shoots through, not only are you pushing past Fjord

1812
01:02:35.810 --> 01:02:37.000
but you're also waiting for a moment

1813
01:02:37.000 --> 01:02:39.690
where the giant gorilla that's slamming towards it

1814
01:02:39.690 --> 01:02:42.120
brings the fists up and you, shh, streak past

1815
01:02:42.120 --> 01:02:43.590
and still manage to hit the creature.

1816
01:02:43.590 --> 01:02:46.590
Like a million points.
Oh my god.

1817
01:02:46.590 --> 01:02:48.111
It had one hit point.

1818
01:02:48.111 --> 01:02:49.160
(laughing)

1819
01:02:49.160 --> 01:02:50.780
You hit it, dshh.
What a waste of all those

1820
01:02:50.780 --> 01:02:52.347
amazing rolls.
I know.

1821
01:02:52.347 --> 01:02:54.530
And he collapses and falls into the swamp, unmoving.

1822
01:02:56.026 --> 01:02:57.269
Then his body swells.
Ugh!

1823
01:02:57.269 --> 01:02:58.102
(laughing)

1824
01:02:58.102 --> 01:03:00.439
And poison all around you.
Run for your--

1825
01:03:00.439 --> 01:03:01.590
I need Beauregard, I need gorilla man,

1826
01:03:01.590 --> 01:03:03.080
and I need Fjord to go ahead and make--

1827
01:03:03.080 --> 01:03:04.790
Not Beau.
I'm good.

1828
01:03:04.790 --> 01:03:05.770
Oh not Beau 'cause you're fine.

1829
01:03:05.770 --> 01:03:07.791
With advantage and a D4.
Yep.

1830
01:03:07.791 --> 01:03:09.200
(dice clattering)

1831
01:03:09.200 --> 01:03:11.480
Oh, with advantage?
With advantage and a D4.

1832
01:03:12.360 --> 01:03:14.007
Way better.

1833
01:03:14.007 --> 01:03:16.440
(dice clattering)

1834
01:03:16.440 --> 01:03:18.790
25.
25, nice.

1835
01:03:18.790 --> 01:03:21.220
So, you take eight points of poison damage.

1836
01:03:21.220 --> 01:03:22.470
'Kay.
20.

1837
01:03:23.580 --> 01:03:25.610
You take eight points of poison damage.

1838
01:03:26.540 --> 01:03:29.170
There you go. (rubs hands)

1839
01:03:29.170 --> 01:03:31.250
Climbing is an action?

1840
01:03:31.250 --> 01:03:33.920
Or is it a movement?
You can climb

1841
01:03:33.920 --> 01:03:37.110
a certain amount with half, your movement is very minimized,

1842
01:03:37.110 --> 01:03:40.990
but you can attempt it.
Hm.

1843
01:03:40.990 --> 01:03:43.056
Ah-hmm, ah-hmm.

1844
01:03:43.056 --> 01:03:43.889
(laughing)

1845
01:03:43.889 --> 01:03:46.070
I will disengage with the one in front of me.

1846
01:03:46.070 --> 01:03:48.890
Okay.
And I will run and

1847
01:03:48.890 --> 01:03:51.539
slide under, between

1848
01:03:51.539 --> 01:03:53.730
Capeleb's

1849
01:03:55.310 --> 01:03:57.380
legs, between his legs just to--

1850
01:03:57.380 --> 01:03:59.570
Capeleb?
Capeleb.

1851
01:03:59.570 --> 01:04:00.820
Just kinda rush through and come to the other side,

1852
01:04:00.820 --> 01:04:02.030
you mean?
Yeah.

1853
01:04:02.030 --> 01:04:03.330
Yeah, that's doable.

1854
01:04:03.330 --> 01:04:05.000
So, you kind of run and you slide

1855
01:04:05.000 --> 01:04:06.500
and because it's all slick marshland,

1856
01:04:06.500 --> 01:04:07.900
it kinda Slip 'N Slides you, shh,

1857
01:04:07.900 --> 01:04:10.310
through the gorilla's legs and out the other side.

1858
01:04:10.310 --> 01:04:11.970
You kinda catch yourself and look up.

1859
01:04:11.970 --> 01:04:13.622
Ooh, I went over a rock.

1860
01:04:13.622 --> 01:04:15.574
You almost got, lookin' up, foreheaded by the monkey wang.

1861
01:04:15.574 --> 01:04:17.921
(laughing)

1862
01:04:17.921 --> 01:04:18.802
Alrighty, that finishes--

1863
01:04:18.802 --> 01:04:19.635
Did they all make saving throws at the

1864
01:04:19.635 --> 01:04:21.470
end of their turn to see if they broke the--

1865
01:04:21.470 --> 01:04:23.340
We should do that now.
Yeah.

1866
01:04:23.340 --> 01:04:25.260
All right, so those,

1867
01:04:26.560 --> 01:04:28.170
him?

1868
01:04:28.170 --> 01:04:29.003
Fail.

1869
01:04:29.003 --> 01:04:30.130
Him?

1870
01:04:30.130 --> 01:04:30.963
Fail.

1871
01:04:30.963 --> 01:04:32.220
Him?

1872
01:04:32.220 --> 01:04:33.053
Fail.

1873
01:04:33.053 --> 01:04:34.300
Him?

1874
01:04:34.300 --> 01:04:35.133
Fail.

1875
01:04:35.133 --> 01:04:36.184
Him?

1876
01:04:36.184 --> 01:04:37.017
(dice clattering)
(chuckling)

1877
01:04:37.017 --> 01:04:37.850
That's cocked.

1878
01:04:37.850 --> 01:04:38.730
(dice clattering)

1879
01:04:38.730 --> 01:04:40.090
Succeed.
Oh!

1880
01:04:40.090 --> 01:04:40.923
He is free.

1881
01:04:40.923 --> 01:04:43.270
I'm gonna go ahead and mark that just to have it.

1882
01:04:44.880 --> 01:04:45.713
That one?
Very

1883
01:04:45.713 --> 01:04:47.240
patriarchal society--
Fail.

1884
01:04:47.240 --> 01:04:48.350
That one?
Of zombies.

1885
01:04:48.350 --> 01:04:50.080
Fail.
Wow.

1886
01:04:50.080 --> 01:04:50.913
What?

1887
01:04:50.913 --> 01:04:51.860
They really like your diamond.

1888
01:04:51.860 --> 01:04:54.083
They really like that diamond.

1889
01:04:54.083 --> 01:04:55.740
They have a shitty wisdom saving throw.

1890
01:04:55.740 --> 01:04:56.720
What about this one?

1891
01:04:56.720 --> 01:04:58.110
Yeah, I don't think Matt can see that one.

1892
01:04:58.110 --> 01:04:59.090
Do you see this one behind the tree?

1893
01:04:59.090 --> 01:05:01.330
Oh shit, yeah, I'm blockin' my own self.

1894
01:05:01.330 --> 01:05:03.680
He would have gone--
I was blockin' myself.

1895
01:05:03.680 --> 01:05:04.513
As well.

1896
01:05:04.513 --> 01:05:05.920
So, just to mark that off there, Caduceus,

1897
01:05:05.920 --> 01:05:07.390
you do have two attacks on you from the one

1898
01:05:07.390 --> 01:05:08.550
that you blasted back last round that

1899
01:05:08.550 --> 01:05:09.770
did catch up, thank you for the reminder.

1900
01:05:09.770 --> 01:05:11.630
I was blocking with my own terrain.

1901
01:05:11.630 --> 01:05:13.227
Too much terrain.

1902
01:05:13.227 --> 01:05:14.240
(dice clattering)

1903
01:05:14.240 --> 01:05:17.200
That is a, cock number, 23 and a 20.

1904
01:05:18.080 --> 01:05:20.010
Those hit.
All right.

1905
01:05:20.010 --> 01:05:24.225
You take 12 points of slashing damage.

1906
01:05:24.225 --> 01:05:25.058
(laughing)

1907
01:05:25.058 --> 01:05:25.910
As the one that you blasted back now kind of

1908
01:05:25.910 --> 01:05:27.680
scoots towards you really low to the ground

1909
01:05:27.680 --> 01:05:29.740
and as it comes up, it just rakes you twice upward

1910
01:05:29.740 --> 01:05:32.236
with these kind of rising claw strikes.

1911
01:05:32.236 --> 01:05:34.930
(talking over each other)

1912
01:05:34.930 --> 01:05:37.510
How am I, I'm in contact with, oh my god,

1913
01:05:37.510 --> 01:05:38.900
I've got a lot of them around me, don't I?

1914
01:05:38.900 --> 01:05:40.094
Yeah.

1915
01:05:40.094 --> 01:05:40.927
A lot of them just rushed past you

1916
01:05:40.927 --> 01:05:42.040
and are staring at Jester, but one of them did

1917
01:05:42.040 --> 01:05:43.660
manage to come--
One of them,

1918
01:05:43.660 --> 01:05:44.860
I'm engaged with one.

1919
01:05:44.860 --> 01:05:46.580
Correct.
Okay.

1920
01:05:46.580 --> 01:05:47.620
All right, so that brings us, then,

1921
01:05:47.620 --> 01:05:48.710
Nott's turn, Caduceus, you're up.

1922
01:05:48.710 --> 01:05:49.760
Beau, you're on deck.

1923
01:05:51.624 --> 01:05:54.750
I'm trying to take a look at what's going on.

1924
01:05:54.750 --> 01:05:58.680
First thing I'm gonna do is I'm going to take my movement.

1925
01:05:58.680 --> 01:06:02.080
I'm actually, yeah, I'm gonna take my movement,

1926
01:06:02.080 --> 01:06:05.090
I'm gonna come as far out this way as I can.

1927
01:06:07.450 --> 01:06:08.600
That's as far as you can get to there,

1928
01:06:08.600 --> 01:06:09.900
next to the floating stump.

1929
01:06:09.900 --> 01:06:11.270
You're kinda up to waist-high in water.

1930
01:06:11.270 --> 01:06:12.330
Cool cool.
That one that just

1931
01:06:12.330 --> 01:06:14.570
attacked you does get attack of opportunity against you.

1932
01:06:15.745 --> 01:06:18.590
And rolls natural one, so it goes to strike towards you

1933
01:06:18.590 --> 01:06:21.660
and just kinda slips and then falls into the water

1934
01:06:21.660 --> 01:06:23.760
and spends the rest of the kinda the next round of action

1935
01:06:23.760 --> 01:06:26.020
just tryna get out of the muck.

1936
01:06:26.020 --> 01:06:27.827
What're you doin'?
Are we, have we,

1937
01:06:27.827 --> 01:06:31.123
are we doing a thing?
We can do the thing, mm hm.

1938
01:06:31.123 --> 01:06:33.140
What's the thing?
I'm going to hold

1939
01:06:33.140 --> 01:06:35.230
Turn Undead and I'm going to wait for

1940
01:06:35.230 --> 01:06:38.770
Jester's signal.
Okay, you got it.

1941
01:06:38.770 --> 01:06:40.700
So, you're holding Turn Undead as an action.

1942
01:06:40.700 --> 01:06:42.100
That finishes your go.

1943
01:06:42.100 --> 01:06:44.920
That brings us to Beauregard.
Do I see

1944
01:06:44.920 --> 01:06:47.210
any of this signaling happening?

1945
01:06:48.170 --> 01:06:51.300
Right now, you are--
Do I have any clue, huh?

1946
01:06:51.300 --> 01:06:53.130
They haven't made a signal towards you, so probably not.

1947
01:06:53.130 --> 01:06:54.640
All right.
We were standing in--

1948
01:06:54.640 --> 01:06:58.060
The zombie Jesus and the guy who was next to me,

1949
01:06:58.060 --> 01:06:59.630
I'm just gonna keep wailing on them.

1950
01:06:59.630 --> 01:07:00.811
Go for it.

1951
01:07:00.811 --> 01:07:01.880
(dice clattering)

1952
01:07:01.880 --> 01:07:03.980
And I have an advantage on attack rolls?

1953
01:07:04.998 --> 01:07:06.283
Yes.
You do, yup.

1954
01:07:06.283 --> 01:07:07.116
(dice clattering)

1955
01:07:07.116 --> 01:07:07.949
Okay, first one.

1956
01:07:09.080 --> 01:07:10.850
21.
That hits.

1957
01:07:10.850 --> 01:07:13.600
Second one, ho-ho, 13.

1958
01:07:15.070 --> 01:07:15.903
Both hit.

1959
01:07:15.903 --> 01:07:17.820
I rolled a natural one and a three.

1960
01:07:17.820 --> 01:07:19.270
Natural one misses automatically.

1961
01:07:19.270 --> 01:07:21.523
No, but that was--
No, with advantage.

1962
01:07:21.523 --> 01:07:22.356
With advantage.
Oh, the advantages.

1963
01:07:22.356 --> 01:07:23.737
Right, yeah.
Yeah.

1964
01:07:23.737 --> 01:07:24.820
So, both hit.

1965
01:07:25.850 --> 01:07:27.230
Yeah, one to each.
Go for it.

1966
01:07:27.230 --> 01:07:28.520
First one, wait, did you say something

1967
01:07:28.520 --> 01:07:30.090
about advantage on attack rolls?

1968
01:07:30.090 --> 01:07:31.490
Yep.
Yup.

1969
01:07:31.490 --> 01:07:33.540
So what, you get to re-roll it if you don't--

1970
01:07:33.540 --> 01:07:35.020
No, attack rolls, not damage.

1971
01:07:35.898 --> 01:07:37.010
Oh, okay.
Yep.

1972
01:07:37.010 --> 01:07:38.570
Not damage, not damage.
Correct.

1973
01:07:38.570 --> 01:07:40.230
Attack rolls and saving throws.

1974
01:07:40.230 --> 01:07:42.500
And saving throws.
You don't really need--

1975
01:07:42.500 --> 01:07:47.500
Okay, 11 to zombie Jesus.
Zombie Jesus falls--

1976
01:07:47.520 --> 01:07:49.076
Zombie Jesus--
Oh!

1977
01:07:49.076 --> 01:07:50.410
And the other one, how much?

1978
01:07:50.410 --> 01:07:51.823
Killed?
Don't worry,

1979
01:07:51.823 --> 01:07:52.656
he'll rise again.
Oh okay, yeah.

1980
01:07:52.656 --> 01:07:53.489
And the other one is nine.

1981
01:07:53.489 --> 01:07:56.210
Don't let zombie Jesus fall 'cause he'll knock the--

1982
01:07:56.210 --> 01:07:58.261
We got three days, we got three days.

1983
01:07:58.261 --> 01:07:59.094
The other ones aren't affected by

1984
01:07:59.094 --> 01:07:59.927
the poison, so it's fine.

1985
01:07:59.927 --> 01:08:01.080
They don't take damage.
They don't take damage.

1986
01:08:01.080 --> 01:08:02.710
Okay, good.
Burn themselves.

1987
01:08:03.920 --> 01:08:06.460
So, both of those, you punch, and as you hit them,

1988
01:08:06.460 --> 01:08:09.627
like pinatas filled with toxic juice, they both

1989
01:08:09.627 --> 01:08:10.730
(laughing)

1990
01:08:10.730 --> 01:08:14.400
just explode, scattering venomous liquid

1991
01:08:14.400 --> 01:08:16.120
across the field around all of you.

1992
01:08:16.120 --> 01:08:17.930
And just for a second, it goes slow motion

1993
01:08:17.930 --> 01:08:21.260
and Beau just like, Flashdance bathes--

1994
01:08:21.260 --> 01:08:22.093
In the poison.

1995
01:08:23.240 --> 01:08:24.289
In the goop.
With your friends

1996
01:08:24.289 --> 01:08:25.122
behind you screaming in pain.

1997
01:08:25.122 --> 01:08:26.930
Yes.
That's amazing.

1998
01:08:26.930 --> 01:08:28.080
Very metal, very metal.

1999
01:08:29.150 --> 01:08:32.310
To that, I need Jester

2000
01:08:32.310 --> 01:08:35.700
and you, monkey man, to go ahead and make

2001
01:08:35.700 --> 01:08:37.290
a constitution saving throw

2002
01:08:37.290 --> 01:08:39.830
with advantage, as of Yasha's epic scream--

2003
01:08:39.830 --> 01:08:41.580
I asked her how to make a constitution saving throw

2004
01:08:41.580 --> 01:08:44.440
'cause I was attacked and I have a spell up, but I--

2005
01:08:44.440 --> 01:08:45.490
Oh, yeah.
Just rolled a 20,

2006
01:08:45.490 --> 01:08:46.920
everything's fine.
What should you do,

2007
01:08:46.920 --> 01:08:48.848
throw this diamond and make them--

2008
01:08:48.848 --> 01:08:49.681
19.
Chase it away?

2009
01:08:49.681 --> 01:08:51.200
19? Okay.

2010
01:08:51.200 --> 01:08:52.310
Oh, shit, okay.

2011
01:08:52.310 --> 01:08:53.170
That is

2012
01:08:54.950 --> 01:08:56.730
20 points--
Oh wait, I would add

2013
01:08:56.730 --> 01:08:57.880
a D4 to that?

2014
01:08:57.880 --> 01:08:59.700
No, that's just for--
Saving throws.

2015
01:08:59.700 --> 01:09:02.480
Yeah, so I would've rolled a, added a D4.

2016
01:09:02.480 --> 01:09:03.830
Oh, so what'd I say, 19?

2017
01:09:03.830 --> 01:09:05.170
20.
So, 10 points of damage.

2018
01:09:05.170 --> 01:09:07.677
Go ahead and make a constitution check

2019
01:09:07.677 --> 01:09:08.510
or a constitution saving throw

2020
01:09:08.510 --> 01:09:09.400
to see if you maintain your spell.

2021
01:09:09.400 --> 01:09:10.910
Constitution saving throw also has advantage

2022
01:09:10.910 --> 01:09:11.743
in a D4.
Yup.

2023
01:09:11.743 --> 01:09:13.240
Yes it does.
Yup.

2024
01:09:13.240 --> 01:09:15.190
(dice clattering)

2025
01:09:15.190 --> 01:09:17.454
Okay.
Ooh, ooh.

2026
01:09:17.454 --> 01:09:18.287
Ooh!

2027
01:09:18.287 --> 01:09:20.230
17 plus three, 20.
20.

2028
01:09:20.230 --> 01:09:22.310
Okay, so you maintain concentration on your spells.

2029
01:09:22.310 --> 01:09:24.820
The other blast, I'm gonna need Nott,

2030
01:09:24.820 --> 01:09:26.210
just Nott to go ahead and make a constitution throw.

2031
01:09:26.210 --> 01:09:27.170
I need to roll as well.

2032
01:09:27.170 --> 01:09:28.180
Yeah, oh, sorry.
21.

2033
01:09:28.180 --> 01:09:29.300
21, so that's another 10 points

2034
01:09:29.300 --> 01:09:30.270
of poison damage to your monkey.

2035
01:09:30.270 --> 01:09:32.200
And you also have advantage with a D4.

2036
01:09:32.200 --> 01:09:34.410
Oh yeah, you get advantage--
And a D4 added.

2037
01:09:34.410 --> 01:09:36.743
Oh, that's slightly better.
Still bad.

2038
01:09:36.743 --> 01:09:38.660
(chuckles) Constitu--
Yep.

2039
01:09:38.660 --> 01:09:40.037
You've got your D4--
Plus a D4.

2040
01:09:40.037 --> 01:09:41.790
Not real good.

2041
01:09:41.790 --> 01:09:44.680
Right now I'm at a nine and now I'm at an 11.

2042
01:09:44.680 --> 01:09:46.070
That's still a fail.

2043
01:09:46.070 --> 01:09:47.860
You take 16 points of poison damage.

2044
01:09:47.860 --> 01:09:50.580
I'm gonna use uncanny something?

2045
01:09:50.580 --> 01:09:52.040
No, it's an area affect.

2046
01:09:52.040 --> 01:09:54.407
Yes, constitution save is not a dexterity saving throw.

2047
01:09:54.407 --> 01:09:55.760
Evas--
Actually, no, it's not.

2048
01:09:55.760 --> 01:09:58.932
It's for halve damage, right?
I'm gonna avoid air.

2049
01:09:58.932 --> 01:10:00.331
Evasion?
Lemme check, lemme check.

2050
01:10:00.331 --> 01:10:01.164
Little check on--
Dancing between

2051
01:10:01.164 --> 01:10:03.031
the raindrops.
Kind of, yeah.

2052
01:10:03.031 --> 01:10:04.401
(imitated whooshing)

2053
01:10:04.401 --> 01:10:06.140
Double check the wording on the rogue ability here.

2054
01:10:07.033 --> 01:10:07.866
Maybe you can duck underwater

2055
01:10:07.866 --> 01:10:09.550
for a second.
Sure.

2056
01:10:09.550 --> 01:10:10.510
No no, I can't--
You're little.

2057
01:10:10.510 --> 01:10:12.280
I don't like that.
Well, you could.

2058
01:10:12.280 --> 01:10:13.940
You also have a--
Saving throw,

2059
01:10:13.940 --> 01:10:15.320
it's constitution, so it is unaffected

2060
01:10:15.320 --> 01:10:16.710
by evasion, unfortunately, so.

2061
01:10:16.710 --> 01:10:17.820
16 points.
16 points

2062
01:10:17.820 --> 01:10:19.400
of poison damage to you.

2063
01:10:19.400 --> 01:10:20.233
Alrighty.

2064
01:10:20.233 --> 01:10:21.130
Does your ring make it so that

2065
01:10:21.130 --> 01:10:22.613
you can run full speed on a--

2066
01:10:23.580 --> 01:10:24.970
I have been running full speed--

2067
01:10:24.970 --> 01:10:26.150
Okay.
But I don't know if

2068
01:10:26.150 --> 01:10:27.410
that's because of the ring or just because

2069
01:10:27.410 --> 01:10:28.641
I'm awesome.
Oh, that's fair.

2070
01:10:28.641 --> 01:10:29.920
Well, because of the ring, you don't

2071
01:10:29.920 --> 01:10:31.400
have to worry about the terrain.

2072
01:10:31.400 --> 01:10:33.230
Bro Hefner.
I'm gonna go--

2073
01:10:33.230 --> 01:10:35.140
I'm drinking chai.

2074
01:10:35.140 --> 01:10:39.260
That is now from Caduceus', now Beau's turn, to Caleb.

2075
01:10:39.260 --> 01:10:40.190
Caleb, you're up, Jester, you're on deck.

2076
01:10:40.190 --> 01:10:42.420
So, this is a whole crowd of them still staring at Jester

2077
01:10:42.420 --> 01:10:44.950
and this one in red is the one that is active.

2078
01:10:44.950 --> 01:10:46.410
This one in red and this one

2079
01:10:46.410 --> 01:10:49.120
and the one that's still attacking Yasha over there,

2080
01:10:50.138 --> 01:10:51.316
those are the three that are currently unaffected.

2081
01:10:51.316 --> 01:10:52.149
All right, well where the monkey is looking,

2082
01:10:52.149 --> 01:10:54.150
he can see this one who is red and turns over

2083
01:10:54.150 --> 01:10:57.620
and sees it snarling at Jester.

2084
01:10:57.620 --> 01:10:59.060
He is a monkey, he goes forward

2085
01:10:59.060 --> 01:11:00.400
and pounds it into the ground.

2086
01:11:00.400 --> 01:11:02.070
Ugh, but then--
Move over here

2087
01:11:02.070 --> 01:11:02.903
to make space for it.

2088
01:11:02.903 --> 01:11:05.040
Maybe throw him away from me?

2089
01:11:05.040 --> 01:11:07.345
So, go for it, make the attacks.

2090
01:11:07.345 --> 01:11:09.762
(whispering)

2091
01:11:14.456 --> 01:11:15.289
Lemme see.

2092
01:11:15.289 --> 01:11:16.122
What's his intelligence?

2093
01:11:16.122 --> 01:11:18.230
What are you looking for?
His intelligence is seven,

2094
01:11:18.230 --> 01:11:19.680
that is exactly what he does.

2095
01:11:22.389 --> 01:11:23.889
Okay, so that's 30, 10 misses.

2096
01:11:24.790 --> 01:11:25.623
Who's fucked?

2097
01:11:26.470 --> 01:11:28.870
Okay, just checking, just checking who's fucked.

2098
01:11:29.790 --> 01:11:32.190
The first is a 24.

2099
01:11:33.560 --> 01:11:35.260
24 to hit? All right, that hits.

2100
01:11:36.123 --> 01:11:36.956
And

2101
01:11:37.840 --> 01:11:39.100
24.

2102
01:11:39.100 --> 01:11:40.100
Both hit.
Yeah.

2103
01:11:45.430 --> 01:11:46.970
Is that the attacks or the damage?

2104
01:11:46.970 --> 01:11:48.000
That's the damage.

2105
01:11:48.000 --> 01:11:49.840
Both hits?
I should

2106
01:11:49.840 --> 01:11:51.640
probably roll to hit.

2107
01:11:51.640 --> 01:11:52.670
And it's an advantage for him, yes?

2108
01:11:52.670 --> 01:11:54.220
Correct.
With a D4.

2109
01:11:54.220 --> 01:11:56.340
With a D4, so--
So, the first one is?

2110
01:11:56.340 --> 01:11:59.170
10, 10, 10 is 19--
That hits.

2111
01:11:59.170 --> 01:12:01.242
Plus a four, okay.
Wait.

2112
01:12:01.242 --> 01:12:02.291
That's a 20.
That's a 20.

2113
01:12:02.291 --> 01:12:04.890
Yeah, one's a, oh no, that's not, an advantage.

2114
01:12:04.890 --> 01:12:07.430
Yeah, that's a 20.
(sighs) Got distracted.

2115
01:12:07.430 --> 01:12:08.263
Wrong one.
Yup.

2116
01:12:08.263 --> 01:12:09.096
You're good.
It's fine.

2117
01:12:09.096 --> 01:12:09.929
Roll the second attack to see if

2118
01:12:09.929 --> 01:12:11.234
it hits.
Okay.

2119
01:12:11.234 --> 01:12:13.130
(dice clattering)

2120
01:12:13.130 --> 01:12:15.310
That is only a

2121
01:12:15.310 --> 01:12:17.240
11 plus 2 is 13.

2122
01:12:17.240 --> 01:12:18.900
Both hit, all damage is there.

2123
01:12:18.900 --> 01:12:21.660
Even without the critical hit, that was enough to kill it.

2124
01:12:21.660 --> 01:12:22.550
'Kay.
Yeah.

2125
01:12:23.800 --> 01:12:25.990
That one explodes once more.

2126
01:12:25.990 --> 01:12:29.520
This time as it does, it kind of sprays an upward geyser

2127
01:12:29.520 --> 01:12:32.760
of kind of greenish-brackish liquid and it kinda, shhh,

2128
01:12:32.760 --> 01:12:35.630
rains down on the immediate vicinity around where it was.

2129
01:12:35.630 --> 01:12:40.080
I need Jester and yourself to go ahead,

2130
01:12:40.080 --> 01:12:42.240
and Yasha, to make constitution saving throws, please.

2131
01:12:42.240 --> 01:12:44.064
Okay.
Brackish.

2132
01:12:44.064 --> 01:12:45.690
(dice clattering)

2133
01:12:45.690 --> 01:12:46.730
Oh, shit.

2134
01:12:46.730 --> 01:12:48.320
And this gets a D4 to this as well.

2135
01:12:48.320 --> 01:12:50.310
Yep.
Mmhm.

2136
01:12:51.610 --> 01:12:53.213
Yasha.
12.

2137
01:12:53.213 --> 01:12:55.310
12, you just barely make it, that is,

2138
01:12:55.310 --> 01:12:56.540
you take 10 points of poison damage.

2139
01:12:56.540 --> 01:12:58.400
Okay.
10.

2140
01:12:58.400 --> 01:12:59.750
20 points of poison damage to you, Jester,

2141
01:12:59.750 --> 01:13:01.469
and I need you to go ahead and make

2142
01:13:01.469 --> 01:13:03.110
a constitution saving throw, with advantage.

2143
01:13:03.110 --> 01:13:04.250
And a D4.
Mmhm.

2144
01:13:05.448 --> 01:13:06.281
18.
18.

2145
01:13:06.281 --> 01:13:07.360
You take 10 points of poison damage.

2146
01:13:07.360 --> 01:13:08.193
Yup.
Ooh.

2147
01:13:10.116 --> 01:13:10.949
Oh, that's nice.
Yeah, that's good.

2148
01:13:10.949 --> 01:13:12.190
That's nice.

2149
01:13:12.190 --> 01:13:16.420
I rolled 19 plus three, so 22.

2150
01:13:16.420 --> 01:13:18.650
Yeah, so you still manage to maintain your concentration.

2151
01:13:18.650 --> 01:13:20.470
Yes.
Yeah, you're fine.

2152
01:13:20.470 --> 01:13:22.930
Alrighty, that finish your turn, Caleb?

2153
01:13:22.930 --> 01:13:24.400
Yeah.
All right.

2154
01:13:25.840 --> 01:13:27.950
Also, I think 'cause you took the damage,

2155
01:13:27.950 --> 01:13:29.590
you took 10 points of damage?
Mmhm.

2156
01:13:30.672 --> 01:13:31.505
I'm tryna think, there's definitely

2157
01:13:31.505 --> 01:13:32.760
concentration checks for the--

2158
01:13:32.760 --> 01:13:33.740
Oh, for the--
Polymorph form.

2159
01:13:33.740 --> 01:13:34.573
Okay.
Just make

2160
01:13:34.573 --> 01:13:35.981
a couple for me, real fast.

2161
01:13:35.981 --> 01:13:37.852
Sure.
With advantage and a D4.

2162
01:13:37.852 --> 01:13:38.720
It's already an advantage because I'm--

2163
01:13:38.720 --> 01:13:40.864
Correct.
War Caster.

2164
01:13:40.864 --> 01:13:41.730
(dice clattering)

2165
01:13:41.730 --> 01:13:44.130
War Caster.
16.

2166
01:13:44.130 --> 01:13:44.963
You're fine.
Yeah.

2167
01:13:44.963 --> 01:13:46.418
Go one more time?

2168
01:13:46.418 --> 01:13:47.251
(laughing)

2169
01:13:47.251 --> 01:13:49.454
Yeah, he's Shakaste's brother, Warkaste.

2170
01:13:49.454 --> 01:13:50.440
(laughing)

2171
01:13:50.440 --> 01:13:53.720
13 plus, uh, 20.
Just making sure

2172
01:13:53.720 --> 01:13:55.380
that we were keeping track as we go.

2173
01:13:55.380 --> 01:13:56.213
All right, cool.

2174
01:13:56.213 --> 01:13:57.046
Finished with Caleb's go.

2175
01:13:57.046 --> 01:13:58.699
Jester, you're up, Fjord, you're on deck.

2176
01:13:58.699 --> 01:14:00.100
Thank you.
Okay, I'm going to,

2177
01:14:01.970 --> 01:14:04.159
I'm going to Dimension Door.

2178
01:14:04.159 --> 01:14:05.460
(gasps) Oh.
Okay.

2179
01:14:05.460 --> 01:14:06.510
This is new.
I'm gonna

2180
01:14:06.510 --> 01:14:09.350
Dimension Door right here,

2181
01:14:10.240 --> 01:14:12.550
next to Caduceus.
Okay.

2182
01:14:12.550 --> 01:14:15.879
So, boof, right next to him.
And I'm gonna say,

2183
01:14:15.879 --> 01:14:18.115
"This is a signal."
Got it.

2184
01:14:18.115 --> 01:14:19.720
(laughing)

2185
01:14:19.720 --> 01:14:21.360
All right, and you release Turn Undead.

2186
01:14:21.360 --> 01:14:23.350
Turn Undead.
Alrighty.

2187
01:14:23.350 --> 01:14:24.460
Which, yeah.

2188
01:14:25.590 --> 01:14:26.423
Just checkin'--
Depending on

2189
01:14:26.423 --> 01:14:27.720
what level they are at--
That's what I'm sayin',

2190
01:14:27.720 --> 01:14:29.120
depending on the level here.

2191
01:14:29.992 --> 01:14:32.058
(pages flipping)

2192
01:14:32.058 --> 01:14:34.820
All right.
Second or lower, I believe.

2193
01:14:34.820 --> 01:14:36.320
Yep, second or lower.
Okay.

2194
01:14:38.710 --> 01:14:39.840
Here we go.
Turn Undead--

2195
01:14:39.840 --> 01:14:41.370
That's everybody in that radius.

2196
01:14:41.370 --> 01:14:42.680
Yup, 30 feet.

2197
01:14:44.320 --> 01:14:48.610
Oh, (laughs) 17.
That one?

2198
01:14:48.610 --> 01:14:49.820
Oh, uh.
The DC in this is

2199
01:14:49.820 --> 01:14:51.170
17?
Is 17?

2200
01:14:51.170 --> 01:14:54.231
Is, I believe it's 17.
Wow, he succeeds.

2201
01:14:54.231 --> 01:14:55.690
Wow.
I think,

2202
01:14:55.690 --> 01:14:56.523
it's my spell, it's my

2203
01:14:56.523 --> 01:14:57.570
spell DC, right?
Correct.

2204
01:14:57.570 --> 01:14:59.270
Yeah, 17.
Pop.

2205
01:14:59.270 --> 01:15:00.250
Ooh!
Yes.

2206
01:15:00.250 --> 01:15:01.806
Turns to--
Pop pop.

2207
01:15:01.806 --> 01:15:05.100
The poison splashes, then it turns to dust.

2208
01:15:05.100 --> 01:15:08.456
That one over there, same.
Pop.

2209
01:15:08.456 --> 01:15:11.580
You watch 'em just kinda, as Caduceus focuses and releases

2210
01:15:11.580 --> 01:15:15.100
this energy outward, as opposed to a shockwave blast,

2211
01:15:15.100 --> 01:15:16.800
the energy kinda just all the sudden drifts up

2212
01:15:16.800 --> 01:15:20.360
off the ground like this kinda fire-like spark-less lift,

2213
01:15:20.360 --> 01:15:22.900
and then, bvvv, bursts like a thousand tiny fireworks

2214
01:15:22.900 --> 01:15:24.780
across the way and as they come (makes popping sounds)

2215
01:15:24.780 --> 01:15:26.560
around the undead, it goes around you guys

2216
01:15:26.560 --> 01:15:29.620
and it's just like this warm kind of wave that passes by.

2217
01:15:29.620 --> 01:15:32.610
As it explodes near them, you watch it, bsh, explode,

2218
01:15:32.610 --> 01:15:35.490
their body scatters outward and then turns to ash.

2219
01:15:35.490 --> 01:15:36.610
But the poison still splatters.

2220
01:15:36.610 --> 01:15:37.915
Yeah.
Ugh.

2221
01:15:37.915 --> 01:15:38.748
That one there?
That's okay,

2222
01:15:38.748 --> 01:15:39.581
they're all clumped together,

2223
01:15:39.581 --> 01:15:41.593
they're away from--
Bam, psh.

2224
01:15:41.593 --> 01:15:43.230
Yes.

2225
01:15:43.230 --> 01:15:44.063
That one.

2226
01:15:46.060 --> 01:15:47.350
Psh.
Yes.

2227
01:15:49.450 --> 01:15:51.650
Turn down for what?
Boop ba doop a doo.

2228
01:15:52.954 --> 01:15:53.787
That one.
Beau just

2229
01:15:53.787 --> 01:15:56.250
three-point lands in the rain pool and like--

2230
01:15:56.250 --> 01:15:58.263
This is how it's done.
Music video moment.

2231
01:15:58.263 --> 01:16:00.160
Yeah, like a--
Tim Robbins in Shawshank.

2232
01:16:00.160 --> 01:16:01.590
Yes, yeah.
Oh,

2233
01:16:01.590 --> 01:16:03.090
I was thinking like Tom Holland

2234
01:16:03.090 --> 01:16:04.554
dancing to Rihanna.
Tom Holland.

2235
01:16:04.554 --> 01:16:05.387
(laughing)

2236
01:16:05.387 --> 01:16:07.325
Okay, sorry, you guys get--
On Fallon, yeah.

2237
01:16:07.325 --> 01:16:08.560
Yasha and Caleb, I need you to make another

2238
01:16:08.560 --> 01:16:09.860
constitution saving throw with advantage.

2239
01:16:09.860 --> 01:16:11.720
And a D4.
Or like Step Up, Step Up 2,

2240
01:16:11.720 --> 01:16:13.650
or Step Up 3D where they did the dance in the rain.

2241
01:16:13.650 --> 01:16:15.100
Uh huh.
Step Up, Step Up 2--

2242
01:16:15.100 --> 01:16:17.740
Basically, any dance sequence with a rain pool.

2243
01:16:17.740 --> 01:16:19.938
With advantage and a D4.
Okay.

2244
01:16:19.938 --> 01:16:21.039
(dice clattering)

2245
01:16:21.039 --> 01:16:24.410
Oh, same, okay, so.
Jesus, you're fine.

2246
01:16:24.410 --> 01:16:26.520
Oh yeah, okay.
Oh lord, oh lord.

2247
01:16:26.520 --> 01:16:28.744
Just say the number out loud.

2248
01:16:28.744 --> 01:16:30.911
(humming)

2249
01:16:31.805 --> 01:16:32.638
29.
Eight points

2250
01:16:32.638 --> 01:16:33.471
of poison damage.
Okay.

2251
01:16:33.471 --> 01:16:34.304
15.
15.

2252
01:16:34.304 --> 01:16:36.000
Eight points of poison damage.

2253
01:16:36.000 --> 01:16:37.240
All right.

2254
01:16:37.240 --> 01:16:38.713
Oh, and I lost the--
So one,

2255
01:16:38.713 --> 01:16:41.610
one shmeasel skeleton left?

2256
01:16:41.610 --> 01:16:43.380
One skeleton left, or the,

2257
01:16:43.380 --> 01:16:46.180
the kind of lasting husk zombie.

2258
01:16:47.110 --> 01:16:49.079
Yeah.
My Syrinscape crashed.

2259
01:16:49.079 --> 01:16:50.246
That's okay.
Oh.

2260
01:16:50.246 --> 01:16:51.079
That's okay, it's easy enough to get

2261
01:16:51.079 --> 01:16:52.973
back into battle stuff, you know how it goes.

2262
01:16:52.973 --> 01:16:53.806
(laughing)

2263
01:16:53.806 --> 01:16:57.410
Alrighty, that finishes.
Doo da doo ba doo.

2264
01:16:57.410 --> 01:16:58.570
Oh no, yeah, that was your action.

2265
01:16:58.570 --> 01:16:59.670
There's only one left?

2266
01:16:59.670 --> 01:17:01.730
There is one left at the moment.

2267
01:17:01.730 --> 01:17:02.910
Can I--
Turn Undead, man.

2268
01:17:02.910 --> 01:17:05.730
For my bonus action--
Mm?

2269
01:17:05.730 --> 01:17:07.210
For my bonus action--
Yep.

2270
01:17:07.210 --> 01:17:09.159
That's the cleric thing.
Oh wait, no.

2271
01:17:09.159 --> 01:17:10.580
Nevermind.
'Cause you did the spell.

2272
01:17:10.580 --> 01:17:11.725
I did the spell, so--

2273
01:17:11.725 --> 01:17:12.558
That was a good call, though.

2274
01:17:12.558 --> 01:17:13.720
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

2275
01:17:13.720 --> 01:17:15.900
All right, that finishes your go.

2276
01:17:15.900 --> 01:17:18.020
Fjord.
I'll rush over and take

2277
01:17:18.020 --> 01:17:20.630
the last remaining undead piece of shit,

2278
01:17:20.630 --> 01:17:22.750
two swings.
Go up for it.

2279
01:17:23.840 --> 01:17:26.640
Uh, that's crap, 15.
15 hits.

2280
01:17:26.640 --> 01:17:27.473
Yes.
All right.

2281
01:17:27.473 --> 01:17:30.840
Second one is a 21.
Hits.

2282
01:17:30.840 --> 01:17:33.050
Yes.
All right, all right.

2283
01:17:34.460 --> 01:17:36.451
Ooh.
10, high, 19.

2284
01:17:36.451 --> 01:17:37.410
(dice clattering)
(snapping)

2285
01:17:37.410 --> 01:17:39.940
21 points of slashing damage in the first one.

2286
01:17:39.940 --> 01:17:41.230
Nice.
And

2287
01:17:42.150 --> 01:17:43.090
11 plus,

2288
01:17:45.130 --> 01:17:47.470
13 points of slashing damage on the second one.

2289
01:17:47.470 --> 01:17:48.550
You're adding the D4 to those?

2290
01:17:48.550 --> 01:17:49.800
Yes.
For the attack

2291
01:17:49.800 --> 01:17:51.170
or the damage?
For the damage.

2292
01:17:51.170 --> 01:17:52.710
They should be in it for the attack,

2293
01:17:52.710 --> 01:17:54.570
not the damage.
Right, my fault.

2294
01:17:54.570 --> 01:17:58.930
So, 11 points on the second one and only 18 points

2295
01:17:58.930 --> 01:18:01.070
on the first one.
You got it.

2296
01:18:01.070 --> 01:18:03.380
So, as you rush up, tsh tsh, whush,

2297
01:18:03.380 --> 01:18:05.335
strike once in the midsection

2298
01:18:05.335 --> 01:18:06.940
(groans) and that kind of holds him in place,

2299
01:18:06.940 --> 01:18:08.780
like the impact caused its back to seize,

2300
01:18:08.780 --> 01:18:11.020
the second strike, shh, carves back through its leg

2301
01:18:11.020 --> 01:18:12.550
and its leg kinda folds and splinters,

2302
01:18:12.550 --> 01:18:14.968
the bone, ka-chh, breaking in two pieces.

2303
01:18:14.968 --> 01:18:17.030
(makes squelching noise) The head (makes stretching noise)

2304
01:18:17.030 --> 01:18:18.510
bends backwards in an unhealthy way

2305
01:18:18.510 --> 01:18:20.310
and the tongue kinda (growls) lolls open.

2306
01:18:20.310 --> 01:18:21.840
Still standing and it's real angry.

2307
01:18:21.840 --> 01:18:23.630
He's still standin'?
Yup.

2308
01:18:25.210 --> 01:18:26.410
You didn't what?
I didn't roll them

2309
01:18:26.410 --> 01:18:27.880
with advantage.
You should roll to see if

2310
01:18:27.880 --> 01:18:30.340
you get a natural 20 on either of those.

2311
01:18:30.340 --> 01:18:31.370
It's true.
Yeah,

2312
01:18:31.370 --> 01:18:33.240
just do two more rolls.

2313
01:18:33.240 --> 01:18:35.700
Two rolls to see if they're 20.

2314
01:18:35.700 --> 01:18:37.260
Nope.
Okay, good enough.

2315
01:18:37.260 --> 01:18:38.820
All right, Yasha, you're up.

2316
01:18:40.060 --> 01:18:44.130
Okay, well, I mean, I don't think I can get over there.

2317
01:18:44.130 --> 01:18:45.040
Can I get over there?

2318
01:18:45.040 --> 01:18:47.210
You can certainly try.
I can try.

2319
01:18:47.210 --> 01:18:49.120
You can make it.

2320
01:18:49.120 --> 01:18:52.020
5, 10, 15, 20, 25,

2321
01:18:52.020 --> 01:18:53.150
30,

2322
01:18:53.150 --> 01:18:54.170
35, 40.

2323
01:18:54.170 --> 01:18:55.360
Yeah, you can.
Okay, okay.

2324
01:18:55.360 --> 01:18:56.410
Whoa.
All right,

2325
01:18:57.497 --> 01:18:59.330
so I take a swing.

2326
01:19:01.266 --> 01:19:03.040
I got friends in low--
Big ol' swing,

2327
01:19:03.040 --> 01:19:05.140
that's cocked, that's cocked again.

2328
01:19:05.140 --> 01:19:06.740
Here we go.
Ooh.

2329
01:19:07.761 --> 01:19:08.940
Good thing I have advantage.

2330
01:19:08.940 --> 01:19:09.930
Oh wait.
You do not have

2331
01:19:09.930 --> 01:19:10.910
advantage anymore, unless you want--

2332
01:19:10.910 --> 01:19:12.820
That was a natural one.
Oh.

2333
01:19:12.820 --> 01:19:14.029
Yeah, you did not call it--
Unless I what?

2334
01:19:14.029 --> 01:19:17.050
You didn't call Reckless Attacks before--

2335
01:19:17.050 --> 01:19:18.490
Oh yeah, no, no-no-no.
So, the first one misses.

2336
01:19:18.490 --> 01:19:21.600
You go forward and as you go to swing, your foot catches

2337
01:19:21.600 --> 01:19:24.640
one of the swamp roots and you almost fly into it.

2338
01:19:24.640 --> 01:19:26.750
You get your blade up in time before you stumble into

2339
01:19:26.750 --> 01:19:28.960
its kind of flayed body and it manages to

2340
01:19:28.960 --> 01:19:30.890
block you with its weight.

2341
01:19:30.890 --> 01:19:32.170
As you kind of catch yourself again,

2342
01:19:32.170 --> 01:19:34.060
its head, just partially pulled back,

2343
01:19:34.060 --> 01:19:36.973
is like (makes chomping noises) biting over

2344
01:19:36.973 --> 01:19:37.806
the edge of the blade as you retract

2345
01:19:37.806 --> 01:19:38.880
and get yourself in the right position.

2346
01:19:38.880 --> 01:19:40.110
Second attack.
Okay.

2347
01:19:41.040 --> 01:19:42.800
You have a D4 on that, too.
I do?

2348
01:19:42.800 --> 01:19:44.050
Okay, let's see.
Yeah.

2349
01:19:46.757 --> 01:19:48.717
I mean, if I don't mess up the rolls.

2350
01:19:48.717 --> 01:19:49.550
(dice clattering)

2351
01:19:49.550 --> 01:19:50.383
Yup.
Okay.

2352
01:19:51.240 --> 01:19:53.830
19.
19 damage or 19 to hit?

2353
01:19:53.830 --> 01:19:55.060
19 to hit.
19 does hit,

2354
01:19:55.060 --> 01:19:58.090
go ahead and roll damage.
Okay.

2355
01:19:58.090 --> 01:20:03.090
Eight, nine, (whispers) 16.
16 points of damage.

2356
01:20:03.370 --> 01:20:04.734
16 points of damage.

2357
01:20:04.734 --> 01:20:05.817
(dice clattering)

2358
01:20:05.817 --> 01:20:08.178
(laughing)

2359
01:20:08.178 --> 01:20:10.970
You stab it with the second strike and actually bisect it.

2360
01:20:10.970 --> 01:20:13.800
Its torso falls to the ground and the legs kinda

2361
01:20:13.800 --> 01:20:15.500
crumple into place and you're waiting for it

2362
01:20:15.500 --> 01:20:16.890
to explode.
Wait for it.

2363
01:20:16.890 --> 01:20:18.610
Instead, the legs kinda get back up

2364
01:20:18.610 --> 01:20:21.500
and the torso climbs up onto its legs.

2365
01:20:21.500 --> 01:20:23.460
What, it's still alive?
Fuck.

2366
01:20:23.460 --> 01:20:25.130
It was the one that made its Undead Fortitude

2367
01:20:25.130 --> 01:20:27.335
save for this entire fuckin' fight.

2368
01:20:27.335 --> 01:20:28.170
(laughing)

2369
01:20:28.170 --> 01:20:29.003
Fucking die.
So,

2370
01:20:29.003 --> 01:20:31.550
it remains at one hit point.
Don't take it personally.

2371
01:20:31.550 --> 01:20:32.383
(groaning)

2372
01:20:32.383 --> 01:20:33.216
All right.
Okay.

2373
01:20:33.216 --> 01:20:36.560
That finishes your turn, I believe.

2374
01:20:36.560 --> 01:20:37.900
Can I try, yeah.

2375
01:20:37.900 --> 01:20:38.860
I can't do anything else.

2376
01:20:38.860 --> 01:20:40.320
'Cause the Hex Blades curse

2377
01:20:40.320 --> 01:20:41.892
target died.
Ooh, it did.

2378
01:20:41.892 --> 01:20:42.725
Call that.

2379
01:20:42.725 --> 01:20:43.820
You hear additional moans come rushing--

2380
01:20:43.820 --> 01:20:45.610
No!
You are lying.

2381
01:20:46.710 --> 01:20:48.632
We just, whatta we do?

2382
01:20:48.632 --> 01:20:49.465
How do we get out of here?

2383
01:20:49.465 --> 01:20:50.298
From where you guys were over in the space,

2384
01:20:50.298 --> 01:20:52.640
these guys rush in here--
Oh.

2385
01:20:52.640 --> 01:20:54.510
They're just gonna keep coming.

2386
01:20:54.510 --> 01:20:56.040
Should we run?
These two--

2387
01:20:56.040 --> 01:20:57.350
I feel like that's the only--

2388
01:20:57.350 --> 01:20:59.520
Other part of the swamp.
I'd have to start over.

2389
01:20:59.520 --> 01:21:00.640
I know.
This time,

2390
01:21:00.640 --> 01:21:02.410
as all of them have been falling and fighting,

2391
01:21:02.410 --> 01:21:04.050
these all rush forward and as they're

2392
01:21:04.050 --> 01:21:06.040
getting towards you, and they're rushing quickly,

2393
01:21:06.040 --> 01:21:07.270
as they're getting near your bodies,

2394
01:21:07.270 --> 01:21:08.482
you watch their bodies swell

2395
01:21:08.482 --> 01:21:11.830
(makes sucking noises) psh, pop pop pop.

2396
01:21:11.830 --> 01:21:14.440
They're not even going into combat, they're just--

2397
01:21:14.440 --> 01:21:16.060
Exploding?
Detonating around you.

2398
01:21:16.060 --> 01:21:18.170
Isn't it, if they were within 30 feet when I would've,

2399
01:21:18.170 --> 01:21:19.400
when it hit that, would that have been a--

2400
01:21:19.400 --> 01:21:21.470
They were out of the range and just rushed in

2401
01:21:21.470 --> 01:21:22.630
'cause you guys moved, you guys moved

2402
01:21:22.630 --> 01:21:24.840
to the outside that realm.

2403
01:21:24.840 --> 01:21:27.740
So, I need Caduceus
Mmhm.

2404
01:21:27.740 --> 01:21:30.730
And Jester to go make, this is gonna be here.

2405
01:21:32.460 --> 01:21:33.660
Caduceus, you make two saving throws

2406
01:21:33.660 --> 01:21:35.400
for me.
Okay.

2407
01:21:35.400 --> 01:21:36.450
They don't have advantage anymore.

2408
01:21:36.450 --> 01:21:37.490
No.
No more advantage.

2409
01:21:37.490 --> 01:21:39.489
Okay, that's all right, I got a D4.

2410
01:21:39.489 --> 01:21:40.322
(dice clattering)

2411
01:21:40.322 --> 01:21:41.155
Constitution saving throw?
Oh.

2412
01:21:42.246 --> 01:21:44.030
Mmhm.
Uh, 25.

2413
01:21:44.030 --> 01:21:45.920
Okay, eight points of poison damage.

2414
01:21:45.920 --> 01:21:48.593
That's, and Jester, if you don't mind.

2415
01:21:48.593 --> 01:21:51.808
(dice clattering)

2416
01:21:51.808 --> 01:21:54.450
(dice clattering)

2417
01:21:54.450 --> 01:21:57.280
12.
8 points of poison damage.

2418
01:21:58.330 --> 01:22:00.010
Second one against you, Caduceus.

2419
01:22:00.010 --> 01:22:01.210
Go ahead and roll again.

2420
01:22:02.206 --> 01:22:03.548
I mean--
It's gonna add up real fast.

2421
01:22:03.548 --> 01:22:04.751
Are we just gonna keep going?

2422
01:22:04.751 --> 01:22:05.588
Yeah.

2423
01:22:05.588 --> 01:22:07.920
(sighs) 20.
20?

2424
01:22:07.920 --> 01:22:09.590
Eight points of poison damage.

2425
01:22:09.590 --> 01:22:11.015
Jester.

2426
01:22:11.015 --> 01:22:12.540
(dice clattering)

2427
01:22:12.540 --> 01:22:14.132
Mm, that's better.

2428
01:22:14.132 --> 01:22:14.965
(dice clattering)

2429
01:22:14.965 --> 01:22:15.798
I definitely saved.

2430
01:22:15.798 --> 01:22:19.270
Okay, that would be 10 points of poison damage.

2431
01:22:19.270 --> 01:22:21.310
And Caduceus?
Oh, I was.

2432
01:22:21.310 --> 01:22:22.580
Oh no, you're on against the third one.

2433
01:22:22.580 --> 01:22:24.680
I was doing a--
Sorry.

2434
01:22:24.680 --> 01:22:25.800
(talking over each other.

2435
01:22:25.800 --> 01:22:27.300
Another one?
You made two, right?

2436
01:22:27.300 --> 01:22:28.550
Yeah.
Sorry, then you're fine.

2437
01:22:28.550 --> 01:22:30.220
Oh, I'm okay?

2438
01:22:30.220 --> 01:22:31.860
Those are all the ones you guys have to worry about.

2439
01:22:31.860 --> 01:22:34.450
And then, I rolled to maintain concentration and rolled

2440
01:22:34.450 --> 01:22:35.750
a 25.
Okay.

2441
01:22:35.750 --> 01:22:36.650
Good, good on you.

2442
01:22:37.810 --> 01:22:38.700
Nott.
Yeah.

2443
01:22:38.700 --> 01:22:39.940
Twice for me, if you don't mind.

2444
01:22:39.940 --> 01:22:41.438
Sure.

2445
01:22:41.438 --> 01:22:42.271
(dice clattering)

2446
01:22:42.271 --> 01:22:43.810
Oh shit.
Do we have the advantage?

2447
01:22:43.810 --> 01:22:45.110
No.
No.

2448
01:22:45.110 --> 01:22:48.090
Then, one was a--
You should just

2449
01:22:48.090 --> 01:22:50.290
roll again 'cause they hit each other, it was a thing.

2450
01:22:50.290 --> 01:22:52.040
And then, plus a D4.
One was a 20, it shouldn't.

2451
01:22:52.040 --> 01:22:53.740
Well, now those are terrible.

2452
01:22:53.740 --> 01:22:56.160
Thanks, Laura.
Oh sorry, well.

2453
01:22:56.160 --> 01:22:57.250
Doesn't matter.

2454
01:22:57.250 --> 01:23:00.070
It's single digits.
14 points of poison damage.

2455
01:23:00.070 --> 01:23:01.520
Sorry.
Cool.

2456
01:23:01.520 --> 01:23:02.970
Can I evade one of them?

2457
01:23:02.970 --> 01:23:05.150
Nope, it is not a dexterity-based.

2458
01:23:05.150 --> 01:23:08.030
Oh, doing your Uncanny Dodge, you mean?

2459
01:23:08.030 --> 01:23:08.863
Sure.
Evasion's only against

2460
01:23:08.863 --> 01:23:10.980
dexterity saving throws, unfortunately,

2461
01:23:10.980 --> 01:23:13.570
and Evade, I think, has to be in--

2462
01:23:13.570 --> 01:23:15.833
It's fine.
They're both duds.

2463
01:23:15.833 --> 01:23:16.666
(clunking)

2464
01:23:16.666 --> 01:23:18.360
Well, Evade is against an attack.

2465
01:23:18.360 --> 01:23:19.440
This technically doesn't count

2466
01:23:19.440 --> 01:23:20.720
as an attack, so it's not an--

2467
01:23:20.720 --> 01:23:23.330
I'll just take it, it's fine.

2468
01:23:23.330 --> 01:23:25.090
Uncanny Dodge, it hits you with an attack,

2469
01:23:25.090 --> 01:23:27.200
so it is not a hit or attack, so you take,

2470
01:23:27.200 --> 01:23:31.672
for the second one, I totally forgot, actually.

2471
01:23:31.672 --> 01:23:34.800
(dice clattering)

2472
01:23:34.800 --> 01:23:38.150
Oof, 19 points of poison damage.

2473
01:23:38.150 --> 01:23:38.983
Ouchies.

2474
01:23:40.484 --> 01:23:42.020
(imitated exploding noises)

2475
01:23:42.020 --> 01:23:46.030
And the one that's currently between Yasha and Fjord

2476
01:23:46.030 --> 01:23:49.450
is gonna go ahead and strike twice, once at each of you.

2477
01:23:49.450 --> 01:23:50.680
Okay.
Against you, Fjord.

2478
01:23:50.680 --> 01:23:53.550
Mmhm.
That's gonna be a 14.

2479
01:23:53.550 --> 01:23:56.170
It'll miss.
Yasha, that is a 16.

2480
01:23:56.170 --> 01:23:57.750
No.
It strikes out

2481
01:23:57.750 --> 01:23:59.150
and both you guys just managed to push it away.

2482
01:23:59.150 --> 01:24:01.170
It's barely holding on, its body, its upper torso

2483
01:24:01.170 --> 01:24:03.340
kind of runs or its upper torso just climbs up

2484
01:24:03.340 --> 01:24:05.590
its legs, leaps, and scrambles towards Yasha.

2485
01:24:05.590 --> 01:24:06.880
The legs just kind stay there on its own,

2486
01:24:06.880 --> 01:24:08.890
kinda using its own body as a catapult.

2487
01:24:08.890 --> 01:24:10.930
You push it off onto Fjord and Fjord, you catch it

2488
01:24:10.930 --> 01:24:12.437
and like, "Ah!"
Throw it at me?

2489
01:24:12.437 --> 01:24:13.646
You throw it back on the ground.

2490
01:24:13.646 --> 01:24:14.479
(laughing)

2491
01:24:14.479 --> 01:24:15.312
That's their turn.

2492
01:24:15.312 --> 01:24:17.850
Have some dignity in death.
Nott, you're up.

2493
01:24:17.850 --> 01:24:20.486
I mean, are they gonna keep coming?

2494
01:24:20.486 --> 01:24:21.319
Should we run?

2495
01:24:21.319 --> 01:24:22.152
Do you wanna take your action to look around?

2496
01:24:22.152 --> 01:24:24.510
No, I'll shoot the one between Yasha and Fjord.

2497
01:24:24.510 --> 01:24:26.500
Go for it.
Just take it off the,

2498
01:24:26.500 --> 01:24:28.370
24.
That hits.

2499
01:24:28.370 --> 01:24:31.490
A million points of damage.
It, yeah.

2500
01:24:31.490 --> 01:24:32.874
We'll see if it makes its,

2501
01:24:32.874 --> 01:24:33.748
(dice clattering)

2502
01:24:33.748 --> 01:24:36.040
it does not make its Undead Fortitude save.

2503
01:24:36.040 --> 01:24:37.410
I need Yasha and Fjord to make

2504
01:24:37.410 --> 01:24:38.370
another constitution saving throw.

2505
01:24:38.370 --> 01:24:39.737
Mmhm.
Oh god.

2506
01:24:39.737 --> 01:24:40.900
Without advantage.
With advantage?

2507
01:24:40.900 --> 01:24:42.664
Without advantage.
Without advantage.

2508
01:24:42.664 --> 01:24:43.497
(dice clattering)

2509
01:24:43.497 --> 01:24:46.750
Let's stop killing--
Hoo, 21.

2510
01:24:46.750 --> 01:24:47.800
Stop.
We need to run away.

2511
01:24:47.800 --> 01:24:49.200
We also have to stop--
20 total.

2512
01:24:49.200 --> 01:24:50.280
If they're next to people.

2513
01:24:50.280 --> 01:24:52.192
Seven points of poison damage to each of you.

2514
01:24:52.192 --> 01:24:54.240
Okay.

2515
01:24:54.240 --> 01:24:55.120
Okay.

2516
01:24:55.120 --> 01:24:56.210
What're you guys doin'?

2517
01:24:56.210 --> 01:24:58.820
Fuckin' movin'--
We, how,

2518
01:24:58.820 --> 01:25:01.620
where do we go?

2519
01:25:01.620 --> 01:25:03.760
Keep moving through it or try to get back to the--

2520
01:25:03.760 --> 01:25:05.710
I'm gonna do a Detect Undead really quickly again.

2521
01:25:05.710 --> 01:25:07.190
Okay.
60 feet.

2522
01:25:07.190 --> 01:25:08.023
60 feet.

2523
01:25:08.023 --> 01:25:10.223
In that radius, you sense no other

2524
01:25:10.223 --> 01:25:11.940
undead in your immediate vicinity.

2525
01:25:11.940 --> 01:25:13.230
So, there's nothing in 60 feet.

2526
01:25:13.230 --> 01:25:14.978
Nothing yet.
Do this now?

2527
01:25:14.978 --> 01:25:16.220
(grunting)

2528
01:25:16.220 --> 01:25:17.629
Do you wanna build--
And that's,

2529
01:25:17.629 --> 01:25:18.740
that will last for a little while, so.

2530
01:25:18.740 --> 01:25:19.920
Oh, that will last for awhile?

2531
01:25:19.920 --> 01:25:21.010
There's nothing around us right now.

2532
01:25:21.010 --> 01:25:23.090
It's last for how long?
Let me tell you.

2533
01:25:23.090 --> 01:25:24.620
How many points of damage did we just take?

2534
01:25:24.620 --> 01:25:26.110
Seven.
Seven, okay.

2535
01:25:26.110 --> 01:25:27.310
Turn Undead lasts for a minute.

2536
01:25:27.310 --> 01:25:29.900
This is, oh awesome, Turn Undead is also still up.

2537
01:25:29.900 --> 01:25:31.250
Is Turn Undead concentration, though?

2538
01:25:31.250 --> 01:25:32.160
Uh, no.
No.

2539
01:25:33.360 --> 01:25:34.510
Hold on, I'm looking.

2540
01:25:36.130 --> 01:25:38.640
Eyes of the Grave is until the end of my next turn.

2541
01:25:38.640 --> 01:25:40.740
Okay, so it stays up for the next round.

2542
01:25:41.940 --> 01:25:43.840
So and the second, if anything comes

2543
01:25:43.840 --> 01:25:45.780
into the next round, I get an instant warning.

2544
01:25:45.780 --> 01:25:46.870
Turn Undead is--
It doesn't

2545
01:25:46.870 --> 01:25:48.610
say anything about concentration on here-

2546
01:25:48.610 --> 01:25:51.390
No, I don't think Turn Undead is--

2547
01:25:51.390 --> 01:25:54.890
Concentration.
No, it is turn form,

2548
01:25:54.890 --> 01:25:56.220
it doesn't last for a minute, meaning if

2549
01:25:56.220 --> 01:25:58.180
they're turn, they are.
If they're turn--

2550
01:25:58.180 --> 01:25:59.013
That's what I thought.

2551
01:25:59.013 --> 01:26:00.050
It's an instant move and it can,

2552
01:26:00.050 --> 01:26:01.160
the fear that you put in them

2553
01:26:01.160 --> 01:26:02.510
can last a minute.
Okay.

2554
01:26:03.610 --> 01:26:05.730
So, does that mean you can't detect things right now?

2555
01:26:05.730 --> 01:26:07.870
There is nothing--
Immediately around you.

2556
01:26:07.870 --> 01:26:10.300
Immediately around us.
What are you guys doing?

2557
01:26:10.300 --> 01:26:13.060
You're all covered in gunk, your body itself is--

2558
01:26:13.060 --> 01:26:14.950
We should heal.
Burning from the poison

2559
01:26:14.950 --> 01:26:16.950
that's now kind of seeped into the outside of your

2560
01:26:16.950 --> 01:26:20.609
exposed flesh and begun to found its way into your armor.

2561
01:26:20.609 --> 01:26:22.170
Be better to save mass heals for when someone goes down

2562
01:26:22.170 --> 01:26:26.990
so it gets them up and heals everybody, I think.

2563
01:26:26.990 --> 01:26:28.000
What?
It's quiet, we're here.

2564
01:26:28.000 --> 01:26:29.840
Should we just try and put the hut back up?

2565
01:26:29.840 --> 01:26:31.110
If something comes, we run.

2566
01:26:31.110 --> 01:26:32.677
Capeleb is--
11 minutes

2567
01:26:32.677 --> 01:26:35.460
and then the other half of us stand watch.

2568
01:26:37.120 --> 01:26:38.710
Apeleb, Capeleb?
They're not gonna

2569
01:26:40.664 --> 01:26:43.160
stay away for 11 minutes, but--

2570
01:26:43.160 --> 01:26:46.250
I am keeping a very sharp eye out for anything.

2571
01:26:46.250 --> 01:26:47.930
We should just keep going.
All right.

2572
01:26:47.930 --> 01:26:49.050
Let's keep going.
Up to you guys.

2573
01:26:49.050 --> 01:26:50.080
You guys are still going?

2574
01:26:50.080 --> 01:26:51.050
Try to get out of the mist.

2575
01:26:51.050 --> 01:26:53.410
So, is the mist, did the mist cover the whole forest?

2576
01:26:53.410 --> 01:26:54.243
Yeah, I guess.
Yes.

2577
01:26:54.243 --> 01:26:55.540
We don't know.

2578
01:26:55.540 --> 01:26:57.440
Since you began to enter the forest,

2579
01:26:57.440 --> 01:26:59.420
the mist was kind of slowly hanging around

2580
01:26:59.420 --> 01:27:02.120
the hut anyway, the house, it's just been getting thicker

2581
01:27:02.120 --> 01:27:04.735
as the night progresses and the temperature drops.

2582
01:27:04.735 --> 01:27:05.568
So, it's just gonna get--
We gotta hut it.

2583
01:27:05.568 --> 01:27:07.540
We gotta hut.
There's no escaping it.

2584
01:27:07.540 --> 01:27:09.860
Well, we just keep walking through the night, no?

2585
01:27:09.860 --> 01:27:11.370
With exhaustion already?

2586
01:27:11.370 --> 01:27:13.160
I think we're just gonna make more noise.

2587
01:27:13.160 --> 01:27:14.680
We should chance it for the 10 minutes for the hut.

2588
01:27:14.680 --> 01:27:16.620
Let's do 10 minutes.
Okay.

2589
01:27:16.620 --> 01:27:20.070
I'll jump up and down and start signaling to Caleb.

2590
01:27:20.070 --> 01:27:22.030
And I'm gonna keep Turn Undead prepped for,

2591
01:27:22.030 --> 01:27:23.990
if anything comes near us, I'm gonna immediately

2592
01:27:23.990 --> 01:27:25.817
cast Turn Undead.
Okay.

2593
01:27:25.817 --> 01:27:29.050 line:15%
If I see a feather move in the forest,

2594
01:27:29.050 --> 01:27:30.600 line:15%
I'm gonna immediately do Detect.

2595
01:27:30.600 --> 01:27:32.920 line:15%
Magic.
Okay, you got it.

2596
01:27:32.920 --> 01:27:35.410 line:15%
So, you guys--
You, smart person.

2597
01:27:35.410 --> 01:27:37.230 line:15%
Gorilla goes fft.

2598
01:27:37.230 --> 01:27:39.930 line:15%
You know, I can understand everything that you're saying.

2599
01:27:39.930 --> 01:27:42.510 line:15%
Oh, we didn't have to talk to you like idiots?

2600
01:27:42.510 --> 01:27:43.590 line:15%
No.
Oh.

2601
01:27:43.590 --> 01:27:45.200 line:15%
Okay, so--
You shoulda told us that.

2602
01:27:45.200 --> 01:27:47.010 line:15%
Shh.
You go back to

2603
01:27:47.010 --> 01:27:48.320 line:15%
that little patch of land you had

2604
01:27:48.320 --> 01:27:49.610 line:15%
situated in the middle of this battle

2605
01:27:49.610 --> 01:27:51.890 line:15%
and you begin the 10 minute process

2606
01:27:51.890 --> 01:27:54.550 line:15%
of preparing this ritual a second time.

2607
01:27:54.550 --> 01:27:56.660 line:15%
Who, I would say all of you guys,

2608
01:27:58.440 --> 01:28:00.630 line:15%
everyone make a stealth check.
Ooh.

2609
01:28:01.680 --> 01:28:04.550 line:15%
Oh, it's that fucking trunk probably attracted--

2610
01:28:04.550 --> 01:28:07.570 line:15%
The trunk sound is what you think attracted them.

2611
01:28:07.570 --> 01:28:08.780 line:15%
With advantage.
They weren't drawn to you

2612
01:28:08.780 --> 01:28:11.940 line:15%
until they heard the loud crack and the splash in the water.

2613
01:28:11.940 --> 01:28:15.780 line:15%
Oh, I'm getting myself a D4 as well.

2614
01:28:15.780 --> 01:28:16.613 line:15%
21.
Mmhm.

2615
01:28:16.613 --> 01:28:17.480 line:15%
8.
15.

2616
01:28:18.660 --> 01:28:20.100 line:15%
29.

2617
01:28:20.100 --> 01:28:20.933 line:15%
19.

2618
01:28:21.790 --> 01:28:22.870 line:15%
18.
9.

2619
01:28:22.870 --> 01:28:24.690 line:15%
Wait, these are--
Stealth.

2620
01:28:24.690 --> 01:28:26.520 line:15%
A disadvantage.
A disadvantage for--

2621
01:28:26.520 --> 01:28:28.042 line:15%
Yes.
Disadvantage?

2622
01:28:28.042 --> 01:28:29.363 line:15%
Oh, against anyone that's exhausted.

2623
01:28:29.363 --> 01:28:30.970 line:15%
For anybody who has exhaustion.

2624
01:28:30.970 --> 01:28:33.270 line:15%
Eight still.
And mine is a natural one.

2625
01:28:35.060 --> 01:28:37.313 line:15%
Oh, your first one was a natural one?

2626
01:28:37.313 --> 01:28:38.146 line:15%
Yeah.
Okay.

2627
01:28:38.146 --> 01:28:40.740 line:15%
Did you have a point of exhaustion from last game?

2628
01:28:40.740 --> 01:28:41.670 line:15%
I don't think--
I don't think I do.

2629
01:28:41.670 --> 01:28:43.789 line:15%
No, you weren't exhausted.
Okay.

2630
01:28:43.789 --> 01:28:44.870 line:15%
Okay.
But I do have

2631
01:28:44.870 --> 01:28:46.820 line:15%
Reliable Talent?
It does say

2632
01:28:46.820 --> 01:28:48.560 line:15%
condition is exhaustion.
Oh, then you do.

2633
01:28:48.560 --> 01:28:49.910 line:15%
So yeah, so you roll again.

2634
01:28:49.910 --> 01:28:51.770 line:15%
So yeah, that would be a 10 plus whatever

2635
01:28:51.770 --> 01:28:53.210 line:15%
bonus you have.
23.

2636
01:28:53.210 --> 01:28:54.940 line:15%
23.
It's still 9.

2637
01:28:54.940 --> 01:28:55.773 line:15%
Yeah.

2638
01:28:57.180 --> 01:28:59.410 line:15%
Yeah, um.
Before too, so.

2639
01:28:59.410 --> 01:29:01.250 line:15%
What're these, stealth?
Yeah.

2640
01:29:01.250 --> 01:29:02.600 line:15%
So what is it?
Nine still.

2641
01:29:02.600 --> 01:29:03.433 line:15%
Nine still?
Yeah.

2642
01:29:03.433 --> 01:29:05.300 line:15%
17.
17, okay.

2643
01:29:06.870 --> 01:29:10.180 line:15%
You guys begin kind of guarding the space and keeping

2644
01:29:10.180 --> 01:29:13.410 line:15%
a look out, you two in particular being ready and watchful.

2645
01:29:13.410 --> 01:29:15.389 line:15%
About five or so minutes into this casting,

2646
01:29:15.389 --> 01:29:17.870 line:15%
you begin to see a few more shapes

2647
01:29:17.870 --> 01:29:19.570 line:15%
kind of emerging from the mist,

2648
01:29:19.570 --> 01:29:22.570 line:15%
seemingly still drawn from the nearby sound of battle.

2649
01:29:22.570 --> 01:29:24.860 line:15%
They look a little confused, meaning that

2650
01:29:24.860 --> 01:29:26.390 line:15%
they're not coming directly, bee-lining at you,

2651
01:29:26.390 --> 01:29:29.980 line:15%
but the sounds of combat that recently happened here,

2652
01:29:29.980 --> 01:29:31.530 line:15%
they've been moving in that direction

2653
01:29:31.530 --> 01:29:33.470 line:15%
and you guys haven't moved away from your position,

2654
01:29:33.470 --> 01:29:35.720 line:15%
so they're just now catching up to you.

2655
01:29:35.720 --> 01:29:37.910 line:15%
They're about, I'd say at this point,

2656
01:29:37.910 --> 01:29:40.160 line:15%
you can clock them at about 50 feet from you.

2657
01:29:41.505 --> 01:29:44.770 line:15%
I will cast Major Image--
Yes.

2658
01:29:44.770 --> 01:29:49.260 line:15%
And put a giant thrashing young blue dragon

2659
01:29:49.260 --> 01:29:53.350 line:15%
120 feet in that direction.
Okay.

2660
01:29:53.350 --> 01:29:55.010 line:15%
As you guys see this and you're beginning to prep yourself,

2661
01:29:55.010 --> 01:29:58.870 line:15%
all of a sudden you hear this (roars),

2662
01:29:59.760 --> 01:30:01.090 line:15%
the cracking and breaking of trees.

2663
01:30:01.090 --> 01:30:05.840 line:15%
You glance over and you see a fucking young blue dragon

2664
01:30:05.840 --> 01:30:08.920 line:15%
just land in the middle of this swamp and begin growling,

2665
01:30:08.920 --> 01:30:11.290 line:15%
its mouth crackling with electrical energy.

2666
01:30:11.290 --> 01:30:13.100 line:15%
And you watch as these undead,

2667
01:30:13.100 --> 01:30:15.291 line:15%
immediately their heads turn (growls)

2668
01:30:15.291 --> 01:30:16.300 line:15%
and begin running in that direction.

2669
01:30:16.300 --> 01:30:18.330 line:15%
Oh, okay.
He's back, he's back.

2670
01:30:18.330 --> 01:30:19.780 line:15%
No--
He's back to--

2671
01:30:19.780 --> 01:30:20.864 line:15%
It's me, it's me, I did, I did it,

2672
01:30:20.864 --> 01:30:22.757 line:15%
I did, (rolls tongue) that's me.

2673
01:30:22.757 --> 01:30:23.670 line:15%
(laughing)

2674
01:30:23.670 --> 01:30:24.920 line:15%
How long can that last?

2675
01:30:25.817 --> 01:30:26.928 line:15%
(laughing)

2676
01:30:26.928 --> 01:30:27.761 line:15%
10 minutes?
That's amazing

2677
01:30:27.761 --> 01:30:29.210 line:15%
10 minutes.
10 minutes.

2678
01:30:29.210 --> 01:30:30.694 line:15%
Ah.
Okay.

2679
01:30:30.694 --> 01:30:33.210 line:15%
You, then, sit there and wait and watch

2680
01:30:33.210 --> 01:30:36.200 line:15%
as the loud noise that that Major Image is creating,

2681
01:30:38.010 --> 01:30:38.843 line:15%
two more,

2682
01:30:39.880 --> 01:30:40.713 line:15%
six more,

2683
01:30:41.930 --> 01:30:42.763 line:15%
a dozen more,

2684
01:30:44.310 --> 01:30:46.240 line:15%
you eventually, probably, in the period of time

2685
01:30:46.240 --> 01:30:47.480 line:15%
it takes for you to finish this ritual,

2686
01:30:47.480 --> 01:30:51.090 line:15%
watch somewhere between 40 to 50 more of these undead

2687
01:30:51.090 --> 01:30:52.970 line:15%
come out of the mists from different places,

2688
01:30:52.970 --> 01:30:54.660 line:15%
the shadows just rushing through,

2689
01:30:54.660 --> 01:30:58.950 line:15%
once again at a sprinting speed for a zombie-like creature

2690
01:30:58.950 --> 01:31:00.750 line:15%
in the direction of this dragon,

2691
01:31:00.750 --> 01:31:02.260 line:15%
as thrashing around as they're just kind of

2692
01:31:02.260 --> 01:31:04.980 line:15%
walking in and out of its space, not intelligent enough

2693
01:31:04.980 --> 01:31:06.700 line:15%
to really discern that it's an illusion and just

2694
01:31:06.700 --> 01:31:08.780 line:15%
confused and frustrated that it's not having any effect.

2695
01:31:08.780 --> 01:31:10.490 line:15%
Some of them are popping and exploding

2696
01:31:10.490 --> 01:31:12.440 line:15%
in the hopes of taking this down,

2697
01:31:12.440 --> 01:31:13.940 line:15%
this thing that doesn't exist.

2698
01:31:15.510 --> 01:31:18.480 line:15%
But it's a large, large group of them now.

2699
01:31:18.480 --> 01:31:21.210 line:15%
Probably about 30 or so are just there, nestled around

2700
01:31:21.210 --> 01:31:24.120 line:15%
this dragon illusion.
Oh my god.

2701
01:31:24.120 --> 01:31:28.320 line:15%
As you finish creating the dome. (makes poofing noise)

2702
01:31:28.320 --> 01:31:29.870 line:15%
It is a green and brown mottled color

2703
01:31:29.870 --> 01:31:32.210 line:15%
and it is less moist inside than out,

2704
01:31:32.210 --> 01:31:33.760 line:15%
except for the ground.
Okay.

2705
01:31:35.364 --> 01:31:37.173 line:15%
You guys all step inside?
Yeah.

2706
01:31:37.173 --> 01:31:39.370 line:15%
I will drop it and step inside.

2707
01:31:39.370 --> 01:31:41.270 line:15%
Drop it.
Okay.

2708
01:31:41.270 --> 01:31:42.410 line:15%
Ooh.
They're all gonna

2709
01:31:42.410 --> 01:31:44.996 line:15%
just come out and, like--
Yeah, they're

2710
01:31:44.996 --> 01:31:45.829 line:15%
just gonna pound this.
Well, here's the thing.

2711
01:31:45.829 --> 01:31:47.130 line:15%
We're gonna give it some time.

2712
01:31:47.130 --> 01:31:48.320 line:15%
Well, they're not gonna see us, they can't hear us.

2713
01:31:48.320 --> 01:31:50.550 line:15%
If they come back, we can just Turn Undead

2714
01:31:51.489 --> 01:31:52.370 line:15%
and just keep Turning Undead until

2715
01:31:52.370 --> 01:31:54.460 line:15%
they all go away.
Okay.

2716
01:31:55.600 --> 01:31:58.318 line:15%
I can still do it, you can still do it.

2717
01:31:58.318 --> 01:31:59.790 line:15%
We can still do that.
We'll be fine.

2718
01:31:59.790 --> 01:32:03.660 line:15%
I don't think the group will get through the thing.

2719
01:32:03.660 --> 01:32:05.310 line:15%
And they can hear through the--

2720
01:32:06.290 --> 01:32:07.160 line:15%
Yeah.
Dome?

2721
01:32:07.160 --> 01:32:08.630 line:15%
Okay.
Yeah, so we should just be

2722
01:32:08.630 --> 01:32:11.160 line:15%
quiet as possible for awhile.
Quiet, quiet.

2723
01:32:11.160 --> 01:32:14.120 line:15%
Caleb is picking little insects out of the damaged tree

2724
01:32:14.120 --> 01:32:16.570 line:15%
that was pulled up and is just feeding them to Frumpkin.

2725
01:32:16.570 --> 01:32:19.770 line:15%
There's plenty.
Oh, I take after and I start

2726
01:32:19.770 --> 01:32:22.002 line:15%
doing that for Sprinkle, too.
Okay.

2727
01:32:22.002 --> 01:32:23.890 line:15%
You stop yourself a couple times

2728
01:32:23.890 --> 01:32:25.210 line:15%
before feeding it to Sprinkle 'cause

2729
01:32:25.210 --> 01:32:29.000 line:15%
the toxic poison that was thrown all around this area

2730
01:32:29.000 --> 01:32:30.100 line:15%
where you guys are planning to sleep--

2731
01:32:30.100 --> 01:32:31.849 line:15%
No no, she gives it to Sprinkle.

2732
01:32:31.849 --> 01:32:33.844 line:15%
(laughing)

2733
01:32:33.844 --> 01:32:34.950 line:15%
Good sleep, good sleep.

2734
01:32:34.950 --> 01:32:36.590 line:15%
(laughing)

2735
01:32:36.590 --> 01:32:38.097 line:15%
Shh, shh.

2736
01:32:38.097 --> 01:32:40.090 line:15%
(laughing)

2737
01:32:40.090 --> 01:32:41.549 line:15%
I welcome it.

2738
01:32:41.549 --> 01:32:42.514 line:15%
(laughing)

2739
01:32:42.514 --> 01:32:43.480 line:15%
Just to help everybody heal overnight,

2740
01:32:43.480 --> 01:32:44.750 line:15%
I'm gonna take a few minutes to do

2741
01:32:44.750 --> 01:32:46.400 line:15%
a Prayer of Healing.
Okay.

2742
01:32:47.520 --> 01:32:51.435 line:15%
We all are very, very, very quiet until, you know,

2743
01:32:51.435 --> 01:32:52.268 line:15%
(dice clattering)

2744
01:32:52.268 --> 01:32:53.430 line:15%
hopefully the zombies start to, like.

2745
01:32:54.910 --> 01:32:55.743 line:15%
Yup.

2746
01:32:55.743 --> 01:32:57.390 line:15%
So, as you all get quiet and kind of rest

2747
01:32:57.390 --> 01:32:59.940 line:15%
and begin setting up your space here and you're doing what?

2748
01:32:59.940 --> 01:33:02.640 line:15%
A Prayer of Healing for 25 hit points to everybody.

2749
01:33:02.640 --> 01:33:03.473 line:15%
How long does it take to cast?

2750
01:33:03.473 --> 01:33:04.970 line:15%
Ugh.
10 minutes.

2751
01:33:04.970 --> 01:33:05.803 line:15%
10 minutes?

2752
01:33:05.803 --> 01:33:07.240 line:15%
Okay.
25 points, okay.

2753
01:33:07.240 --> 01:33:09.720 line:15%
So, the illusion drops before you finish

2754
01:33:09.720 --> 01:33:11.505 line:15%
casting your prayer.
Mmhm.

2755
01:33:11.505 --> 01:33:12.338 line:15%
(sneezing)

2756
01:33:12.338 --> 01:33:13.259 line:15%
Gesundheit.

2757
01:33:13.259 --> 01:33:15.050 line:15%
So, as you're kind of quietly muttering the incantation,

2758
01:33:15.050 --> 01:33:16.400 line:15%
I would like you to make a,

2759
01:33:17.413 --> 01:33:18.246 line:15%
(sneezing)

2760
01:33:18.246 --> 01:33:19.079 line:15%
bless you.
Bless you.

2761
01:33:19.079 --> 01:33:20.790 line:15%
Just a general stealth check for me.

2762
01:33:21.628 --> 01:33:22.482 line:15%
All right.

2763
01:33:22.482 --> 01:33:24.213 line:15%
(chuckling)

2764
01:33:24.213 --> 01:33:25.527 line:15%
(dice clattering)

2765
01:33:25.527 --> 01:33:26.360 line:15%
I don't think I can do that.

2766
01:33:26.360 --> 01:33:29.950 line:15%
Can I guide him in this moment?

2767
01:33:31.930 --> 01:33:33.130 line:15%
I feel like--
You can

2768
01:33:33.130 --> 01:33:35.590 line:15%
Blessing of the Trickster with him if you want to.

2769
01:33:35.590 --> 01:33:37.500 line:15%
What does that give me?
Advantage.

2770
01:33:37.500 --> 01:33:39.250 line:15%
Oh, so it's just a straight roll,

2771
01:33:39.250 --> 01:33:40.910 line:15%
I don't have disadvantage.

2772
01:33:40.910 --> 01:33:42.150 line:15%
That's cool, that helps.

2773
01:33:43.355 --> 01:33:45.060 line:15%
(dice clattering)

2774
01:33:45.060 --> 01:33:47.390 line:15%
16.
16, okay.

2775
01:33:47.390 --> 01:33:49.130 line:15%
You manage to speak the incantation

2776
01:33:49.130 --> 01:33:52.610 line:15%
loud enough that it manages to maintain the spell itself

2777
01:33:52.610 --> 01:33:54.214 line:15%
but not enough to draw the attention.

2778
01:33:54.214 --> 01:33:56.450 line:15%
In that kind of little bit of crossover time,

2779
01:33:56.450 --> 01:33:58.100 line:15%
you watch the dragon that's just

2780
01:33:58.100 --> 01:33:59.780 line:15%
thrashing and growling and making noise

2781
01:33:59.780 --> 01:34:03.780 line:15%
in the middle of the swamp here suddenly (pops lips) vanish.

2782
01:34:05.946 --> 01:34:06.779 line:15%
And then right as you're getting towards

2783
01:34:06.779 --> 01:34:07.710 line:15%
the end of your spell, you can see

2784
01:34:07.710 --> 01:34:08.950 line:15%
some of the shapes wandering

2785
01:34:08.950 --> 01:34:10.950 line:15%
from where that cluster of zombies were.

2786
01:34:12.890 --> 01:34:15.640 line:15%
Right as you finish the healing effect, it flashes,

2787
01:34:15.640 --> 01:34:17.300 line:15%
and it heals you all for how much?

2788
01:34:17.300 --> 01:34:18.520 line:15%
Everybody for 25 hit points.

2789
01:34:18.520 --> 01:34:22.155 line:15%
25 hit points to all of you.
"Thank you, sir,"

2790
01:34:22.155 --> 01:34:23.613 line:15%
I say quietly.

2791
01:34:23.613 --> 01:34:26.150 line:15%
(laughs) But the light does not emerge because

2792
01:34:26.150 --> 01:34:29.670 line:15%
the dome manages to remain obfuscating the interior.

2793
01:34:29.670 --> 01:34:31.950 line:15%
But you all watch quietly and tensely as,

2794
01:34:31.950 --> 01:34:34.850 line:15%
over the next hour or so, they just

2795
01:34:34.850 --> 01:34:37.540 line:15%
begin to kind of scatter out a bit.

2796
01:34:37.540 --> 01:34:39.620 line:15%
And others that you didn't notice

2797
01:34:39.620 --> 01:34:41.640 line:15%
kind of walk through the mist behind you.

2798
01:34:42.520 --> 01:34:44.380 line:15%
Night here is a very dangerous thing.

2799
01:34:45.346 --> 01:34:46.930 line:15%
Wow.
At least in

2800
01:34:46.930 --> 01:34:48.630 line:15%
this particular part of the swamp.

2801
01:34:50.061 --> 01:34:51.530 line:15%
But cold.
What did

2802
01:34:51.530 --> 01:34:52.580 line:15%
this place used to be?

2803
01:34:52.580 --> 01:34:54.480 line:15%
Why are there so many dead people here?

2804
01:34:54.480 --> 01:34:55.620 line:15%
Caduceus--
We're whispering

2805
01:34:55.620 --> 01:34:58.310 line:15%
all of this, nothing above a teeny, tiny whisper.

2806
01:34:58.310 --> 01:34:59.520 line:15%
Both of you guys can make history checks

2807
01:34:59.520 --> 01:35:00.620 line:15%
if you want to.
Gotta say, would I know?

2808
01:35:00.620 --> 01:35:01.780 line:15%
You might, make a history check.

2809
01:35:01.780 --> 01:35:03.240 line:15%
Yeah.
Okay.

2810
01:35:03.240 --> 01:35:04.130 line:15%
The two Empire kids might.

2811
01:35:04.130 --> 01:35:07.580 line:15%
Would I know being close, nearby, raised here?

2812
01:35:07.580 --> 01:35:09.242 line:15%
That's what this roll's for.

2813
01:35:09.242 --> 01:35:10.075 line:15%
(laughing)

2814
01:35:10.075 --> 01:35:11.300 line:15%
Oh wait, I don't have advantage.

2815
01:35:11.300 --> 01:35:12.554 line:15%
Nope.
I'll say

2816
01:35:12.554 --> 01:35:13.690 line:15%
because you lived here, close to here, sure.

2817
01:35:13.690 --> 01:35:15.240 line:15%
Roll advantage.
They were both,

2818
01:35:15.240 --> 01:35:16.590 line:15%
but I'm also exhausted, so I'll take

2819
01:35:16.590 --> 01:35:18.930 line:15%
the lower of the two, which is 15.

2820
01:35:18.930 --> 01:35:20.470 line:15%
15, okay.
18.

2821
01:35:20.470 --> 01:35:22.270 line:15%
18.
Wait, 15 is what I rolled.

2822
01:35:22.270 --> 01:35:24.170 line:15%
Okay, plus?
With a history check, it's--

2823
01:35:24.170 --> 01:35:26.050 line:15%
7,000.
23.

2824
01:35:26.050 --> 01:35:27.220 line:15%
23, okay.
Ooh.

2825
01:35:28.950 --> 01:35:30.530 line:15%
During the time of the Julous Dominion--

2826
01:35:30.530 --> 01:35:32.170 line:15%
Beau knows.
During the time

2827
01:35:32.170 --> 01:35:34.070 line:15%
of the Julous Dominion, before the Dwendalian Empire

2828
01:35:34.070 --> 01:35:36.120 line:15%
and the Julous Dominion had their fight,

2829
01:35:37.240 --> 01:35:39.190 line:15%
there were certain sects of people

2830
01:35:39.190 --> 01:35:41.540 line:15%
that lived in what is now the Truscan Vale

2831
01:35:41.540 --> 01:35:44.620 line:15%
and around these mountains that had built

2832
01:35:44.620 --> 01:35:47.580 line:15%
an entire colony based around this,

2833
01:35:49.210 --> 01:35:51.560 line:15%
what they proclaimed to be a god-like creature

2834
01:35:51.560 --> 01:35:53.060 line:15%
that existed in this mountain.

2835
01:35:54.250 --> 01:35:56.940 line:15%
They referred to it as the Twilight Phoenix

2836
01:35:56.940 --> 01:36:00.390 line:15%
and they would burn effigies to it.

2837
01:36:00.390 --> 01:36:02.170 line:15%
They have this longstanding belief that

2838
01:36:02.170 --> 01:36:03.970 line:15%
this mountain was kind of its home

2839
01:36:03.970 --> 01:36:07.636 line:15%
or its what it became when it eventually laid to rest.

2840
01:36:07.636 --> 01:36:09.080 line:15%
And that's why they explain all the geothermal activity

2841
01:36:09.080 --> 01:36:11.330 line:15%
around here they say is just a remnant of it.

2842
01:36:12.433 --> 01:36:13.266 line:15%
Twilight Phoenix.
We did see

2843
01:36:13.266 --> 01:36:15.470 line:15%
a purple sort of firebird down in that

2844
01:36:15.470 --> 01:36:18.600 line:15%
temple of Uk'otoa.
Uk'otoa.

2845
01:36:18.600 --> 01:36:20.440 line:15%
But the people that worshiped this--

2846
01:36:20.440 --> 01:36:22.350 line:15%
Oh right.
The people that

2847
01:36:22.350 --> 01:36:25.210 line:15%
worshiped this entity around this area

2848
01:36:27.060 --> 01:36:30.220 line:15%
also made a lot of enemies and the Julous Dominion itself,

2849
01:36:30.220 --> 01:36:33.440 line:15%
though they were within its terrain, at some point,

2850
01:36:33.440 --> 01:36:37.750 line:15%
they were hunted down and killed in their homeland,

2851
01:36:37.750 --> 01:36:42.000 line:15%
pretty much just wiped out around the base of Mount Mentiri.

2852
01:36:44.060 --> 01:36:45.670 line:15%
I have a question.
Yes.

2853
01:36:46.930 --> 01:36:49.320 line:15%
When you were seeing that vision of Uk'otoa.

2854
01:36:49.320 --> 01:36:50.450 line:15%
Uk'otoa.
Uk'otoa.

2855
01:36:50.450 --> 01:36:54.340 line:15%
And he showed you something in the mountains or something,

2856
01:36:54.340 --> 01:36:56.380 line:15%
like, a location, are we near that?

2857
01:36:56.380 --> 01:36:57.360 line:15%
No.
Would you know?

2858
01:36:57.360 --> 01:36:58.520 line:15%
Yes.
Okay.

2859
01:36:58.520 --> 01:37:02.090 line:15%
No, it's more, it's closer to the Menagerie Coast

2860
01:37:02.090 --> 01:37:04.220 line:15%
and East and inland just a little bit,

2861
01:37:04.220 --> 01:37:05.450 line:15%
before you get to the gate that

2862
01:37:05.450 --> 01:37:06.750 line:15%
leads to the--
Okay, okay.

2863
01:37:06.750 --> 01:37:07.990 line:15%
Empire, if I remember correctly.

2864
01:37:07.990 --> 01:37:09.660 line:15%
You are correct.
Okay.

2865
01:37:09.660 --> 01:37:12.206 line:15%
I remembered correctly?
You did.

2866
01:37:12.206 --> 01:37:13.039 line:15%
(snapping)

2867
01:37:13.039 --> 01:37:14.260 line:15%
Mr. Stone.
What?

2868
01:37:14.260 --> 01:37:15.210 line:15%
Right.
Ice cold.

2869
01:37:16.775 --> 01:37:17.608 line:15%
What?

2870
01:37:18.466 --> 01:37:19.299 line:15%
Uk'otoa.

2871
01:37:19.299 --> 01:37:20.370 line:15%
So, you--
What.

2872
01:37:21.370 --> 01:37:22.203 line:15%
Right.

2873
01:37:23.169 --> 01:37:25.692 line:15%
(laughing)

2874
01:37:25.692 --> 01:37:28.024 line:15%
Ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch.

2875
01:37:28.024 --> 01:37:29.838 line:15%
It's always a good D&amp;D game when Peaches comes out.

2876
01:37:29.838 --> 01:37:31.884 line:15%
(talking over each other)

2877
01:37:31.884 --> 01:37:32.764 line:15%
(laughing)

2878
01:37:32.764 --> 01:37:33.908 line:15%
I can do her all day.
So--

2879
01:37:33.908 --> 01:37:35.265 line:15%
Fuck your mountain and your phoenix.

2880
01:37:35.265 --> 01:37:36.160 line:15%
Yeah, no.
Lore?

2881
01:37:36.160 --> 01:37:37.856 line:15%
Lore.
Peaches.

2882
01:37:37.856 --> 01:37:40.206 line:15%
(laughing)

2883
01:37:40.206 --> 01:37:41.220 line:15%
I'm not explaining.
That's true, right?

2884
01:37:41.220 --> 01:37:43.530 line:15%
We saw tapestries in that temple.

2885
01:37:43.530 --> 01:37:45.980 line:15%
One was a purple--
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

2886
01:37:47.354 --> 01:37:48.187 line:15%
Does that sound about right?

2887
01:37:48.187 --> 01:37:49.340 line:15%
Crap your memory is.
Is there

2888
01:37:49.340 --> 01:37:52.820 line:15%
a roll to see if that sounds relatable?

2889
01:37:55.190 --> 01:37:56.540 line:15%
Can I roll for relatability?

2890
01:37:56.540 --> 01:37:58.570 line:15%
No, your history check was, you don't have

2891
01:37:58.570 --> 01:37:59.850 line:15%
anything that directly connects to those two,

2892
01:37:59.850 --> 01:38:01.370 line:15%
but there was a mention of phoenix

2893
01:38:01.370 --> 01:38:04.020 line:15%
and this was a historical phoenix in this region.

2894
01:38:04.020 --> 01:38:05.313 line:15%
Mmhm.
Yeah.

2895
01:38:05.313 --> 01:38:06.146 line:15%
If it even existed.

2896
01:38:06.146 --> 01:38:07.390 line:15%
Like I said, there were a lot of entities

2897
01:38:07.390 --> 01:38:10.500 line:15%
that were worshiped that were just landmarks,

2898
01:38:10.500 --> 01:38:11.750 line:15%
that were just, you know,

2899
01:38:13.935 --> 01:38:17.640 line:15%
giving a persona and a divine essence

2900
01:38:17.640 --> 01:38:20.990 line:15%
to what is essentially a landmass or a natural phenomenon.

2901
01:38:20.990 --> 01:38:22.490 line:15%
This is not an uncommon thing.

2902
01:38:23.970 --> 01:38:25.510 line:15%
But it could be, who knows?

2903
01:38:26.472 --> 01:38:27.360 line:15%
(chair scraping)

2904
01:38:27.360 --> 01:38:29.020 line:15%
Especially, then, if the worshipers

2905
01:38:29.020 --> 01:38:31.770 line:15%
were hunted down and eradicated.

2906
01:38:31.770 --> 01:38:34.550 line:15%
Yeah, I mean, if you really wanna get crazy,

2907
01:38:34.550 --> 01:38:36.700 line:15%
Uk'otoa had three temples--
Uk'otoa.

2908
01:38:36.700 --> 01:38:39.880 line:15%
And then I'm sure the other two entities might also have--

2909
01:38:39.880 --> 01:38:41.180 line:15%
Three temples.
Right.

2910
01:38:42.647 --> 01:38:43.480 line:15%
Maybe.

2911
01:38:43.480 --> 01:38:44.313 line:15%
Don't know if there were, you know,

2912
01:38:44.313 --> 01:38:46.560 line:15%
forgotten to time temples around here, do you?

2913
01:38:48.200 --> 01:38:50.212 line:15%
Well, I know that this was also

2914
01:38:50.212 --> 01:38:53.400 line:15%
a big battleground of the pre-Calamity--

2915
01:38:53.400 --> 01:38:56.041 line:15%
She's whispering, that's how she whispers.

2916
01:38:56.041 --> 01:38:57.270 line:15%
I'm whispering, yeah, very, yeah.

2917
01:38:58.120 --> 01:39:02.280 line:15%
Do I know of any weird temples around, like ruined temples

2918
01:39:03.250 --> 01:39:05.800 line:15%
around these parts that would fit that description?

2919
01:39:07.145 --> 01:39:09.580 line:15%
No, based on the history check you rolled, not really,

2920
01:39:09.580 --> 01:39:12.090 line:15%
none that you know of.
Hm.

2921
01:39:14.000 --> 01:39:19.000 line:15%
But I know that Pride's Call is not far from here

2922
01:39:19.320 --> 01:39:21.694 line:15%
and that's where they found the other Beacon,

2923
01:39:21.694 --> 01:39:23.790 line:15%
it's just North of here.
Right.

2924
01:39:23.790 --> 01:39:26.950 line:15%
Yeah, on the other side of this mountain range.

2925
01:39:28.207 --> 01:39:29.330 line:15%
Not that this isn't the most comfortable place

2926
01:39:29.330 --> 01:39:31.680 line:15%
we've ever been in, but now that we're in here,

2927
01:39:33.950 --> 01:39:36.300 line:15%
Jester, do you mind telling us--

2928
01:39:36.300 --> 01:39:38.370 line:15%
Oh, yes.
What actually happened?

2929
01:39:38.370 --> 01:39:40.070 line:15%
What the fuck happened in there?

2930
01:39:41.511 --> 01:39:44.260 line:15%
Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay.

2931
01:39:44.260 --> 01:39:46.310 line:15%
As I'm talking, I'm just going to be watching

2932
01:39:46.310 --> 01:39:48.840 line:15%
from the direction we came and see if anything's

2933
01:39:48.840 --> 01:39:51.230 line:15%
coming out of the mist towards us or anything.

2934
01:39:51.230 --> 01:39:52.063 line:15%
You got it.

2935
01:39:53.590 --> 01:39:54.423 line:15%
Well,

2936
01:39:56.863 --> 01:40:01.367 line:15%
okay, so, do you remember when I told you guys that

2937
01:40:03.160 --> 01:40:06.080 line:15%
I could maybe do some, like, spells

2938
01:40:06.080 --> 01:40:09.990 line:15%
that would maybe affect people's memories and stuff?

2939
01:40:09.990 --> 01:40:11.470 line:15%
No.
Don't remember that, but--

2940
01:40:11.470 --> 01:40:14.905 line:15%
Wow, you're real good.
I, well, (laughs) no.

2941
01:40:14.905 --> 01:40:16.150 line:15%
(laughing)

2942
01:40:16.150 --> 01:40:19.540 line:15%
I told you, I don't know, was I around everyone?

2943
01:40:19.540 --> 01:40:22.351 line:15%
We were talking about it with Essek, right?

2944
01:40:22.351 --> 01:40:23.184 line:15%
Yeah.
Oh.

2945
01:40:23.184 --> 01:40:24.017 line:15%
Anyway,

2946
01:40:24.933 --> 01:40:26.980 line:15%
yes, so I, I,

2947
01:40:26.980 --> 01:40:31.030 line:15%
I sort of altered her memory

2948
01:40:31.030 --> 01:40:34.950 line:15%
just a little to where she was like, "Oh my gosh, Jester!"

2949
01:40:34.950 --> 01:40:37.010 line:15%
I made her think that she, like, really liked me

2950
01:40:37.010 --> 01:40:39.040 line:15%
and that we had a really amazing time hanging out,

2951
01:40:39.040 --> 01:40:41.620 line:15%
like, we braided each other's hair and, you know,

2952
01:40:41.620 --> 01:40:43.540 line:15%
she just took an immediate liking to me,

2953
01:40:43.540 --> 01:40:45.800 line:15%
maybe she saw a little bit of herself in me,

2954
01:40:45.800 --> 01:40:47.300 line:15%
I don't know, you know.

2955
01:40:47.300 --> 01:40:48.140 line:15%
And so,

2956
01:40:49.780 --> 01:40:51.750 line:15%
and then she, um, she was like,

2957
01:40:51.750 --> 01:40:53.570 line:15%
"Oh my gosh, I just like you so much.

2958
01:40:53.570 --> 01:40:54.930 line:15%
"What can I do to make you happy?"

2959
01:40:54.930 --> 01:40:56.440 line:15%
And I was like, "Oh change, you know,

2960
01:40:56.440 --> 01:40:58.360 line:15%
"help Nott out and change that."

2961
01:40:58.360 --> 01:41:01.710 line:15%
And she did.
And it just worked?

2962
01:41:01.710 --> 01:41:03.223 line:15%
Well--
Did she,

2963
01:41:03.223 --> 01:41:04.720 line:15%
did she realize what you had done?

2964
01:41:04.720 --> 01:41:07.090 line:15%
No, but she did seem a little confused at the end.

2965
01:41:07.090 --> 01:41:08.240 line:15%
And, you know what?

2966
01:41:08.240 --> 01:41:09.730 line:15%
I don't know if that's normal 'cause

2967
01:41:09.730 --> 01:41:12.570 line:15%
I've never done this before, but just in case,

2968
01:41:12.570 --> 01:41:15.150 line:15%
possibly, that it's not normal, I just thought

2969
01:41:15.150 --> 01:41:16.800 line:15%
maybe it would be smart to leave.

2970
01:41:18.880 --> 01:41:20.090 line:15%
But, you know--
Sure.

2971
01:41:20.090 --> 01:41:22.360 line:15%
As incredible--
If it did work

2972
01:41:22.360 --> 01:41:25.390 line:15%
and if does stick, then, you know, I have a really cool,

2973
01:41:25.390 --> 01:41:27.780 line:15%
powerful good friend who likes cupcakes a lot.

2974
01:41:27.780 --> 01:41:29.480 line:15%
I'm gonna send her some, for sure.

2975
01:41:30.900 --> 01:41:32.923 line:15%
Seems only fair.
Wow.

2976
01:41:32.923 --> 01:41:34.610 line:15%
That's very resourceful, Jester.

2977
01:41:34.610 --> 01:41:36.630 line:15%
Wow.
Amazing.

2978
01:41:36.630 --> 01:41:37.610 line:15%
Yeah.
Wow.

2979
01:41:37.610 --> 01:41:42.610 line:15%
Were you nervous at all?
Oh, well, of course.

2980
01:41:43.190 --> 01:41:45.000 line:15%
She's really scary looking, right?

2981
01:41:47.785 --> 01:41:48.780 line:15%
You seem a little nervous now.

2982
01:41:48.780 --> 01:41:51.370 line:15%
Well yeah, 'cause what if she comes after us?

2983
01:41:51.370 --> 01:41:54.200 line:15%
I mean, all of us were nervous speaking with her.

2984
01:41:54.200 --> 01:41:56.990 line:15%
At least, I was, I don't know about you,

2985
01:41:56.990 --> 01:41:58.950 line:15%
that witch.
If it didn't work,

2986
01:41:58.950 --> 01:42:00.500 line:15%
what were you going to do then?

2987
01:42:02.107 --> 01:42:02.940 line:15%
Ooh,

2988
01:42:04.142 --> 01:42:05.120 line:15%
like, run?

2989
01:42:06.430 --> 01:42:09.050 line:15%
Maybe like--
No.

2990
01:42:09.050 --> 01:42:11.860 line:15%
Dimension Door out of there, if I could,

2991
01:42:11.860 --> 01:42:16.860 line:15%
or like, um, (hums).
We would've thrown down.

2992
01:42:17.850 --> 01:42:19.690 line:15%
It would've been a throw down probably

2993
01:42:19.690 --> 01:42:21.650 line:15%
or maybe, no, she probably woulda been

2994
01:42:21.650 --> 01:42:23.300 line:15%
real pissed if she'd have figured out.

2995
01:42:23.300 --> 01:42:24.710 line:15%
It would've turned into a fight.

2996
01:42:24.710 --> 01:42:25.970 line:15%
Who knows, she might've killed me.

2997
01:42:25.970 --> 01:42:29.170 line:15%
Anyway, thank you for getting the job done.

2998
01:42:29.170 --> 01:42:30.740 line:15%
Yeah.
Yes, I mean,

2999
01:42:31.950 --> 01:42:36.200 line:15%
I don't really feel any different, but I guess I am, now.

3000
01:42:37.200 --> 01:42:39.110 line:15%
I believe that she broke it.

3001
01:42:39.110 --> 01:42:44.110 line:15%
It really was, like, super creepy magic stuff that she did,

3002
01:42:44.210 --> 01:42:46.100 line:15%
so I think she broke it.

3003
01:42:47.320 --> 01:42:48.153 line:15%
But

3004
01:42:50.880 --> 01:42:54.520 line:15%
that's just, I mean, I have so many questions, um.

3005
01:42:55.980 --> 01:42:57.990 line:15%
But like, so if that's true then

3006
01:42:57.990 --> 01:43:00.950 line:15%
I could just change back whenever, I guess.

3007
01:43:00.950 --> 01:43:03.210 line:15%
I think so.
Yeah, we would

3008
01:43:04.180 --> 01:43:06.060 line:15%
go again.
That's great.

3009
01:43:06.060 --> 01:43:09.360 line:15%
But what about Beauregard?

3010
01:43:09.360 --> 01:43:10.193 line:15%
What about you?

3011
01:43:12.470 --> 01:43:13.560 line:15%
What about me?

3012
01:43:13.560 --> 01:43:18.048 line:15%
Well, I mean, didn't she affect your family somehow?

3013
01:43:18.048 --> 01:43:20.140 line:15%
(mysterious music)

3014
01:43:20.140 --> 01:43:22.640 line:15%
I mean, here's the thing:

3015
01:43:24.461 --> 01:43:26.110 line:15%
if she realizes

3016
01:43:26.110 --> 01:43:29.590 line:15%
that, you know, I did something,

3017
01:43:30.460 --> 01:43:31.970 line:15%
then it's possible.

3018
01:43:34.150 --> 01:43:37.090 line:15%
But I mean, even if she doesn't realize,

3019
01:43:37.090 --> 01:43:39.030 line:15%
it still could affect Beauregard, right?

3020
01:43:39.030 --> 01:43:43.000 line:15%
'Cause you have this, your father did something with her?

3021
01:43:44.090 --> 01:43:46.280 line:15%
Don't worry about me or mine.

3022
01:43:48.270 --> 01:43:49.470 line:15%
Don't worry about you?

3023
01:43:51.980 --> 01:43:53.670 line:15%
But--
I think it's possible

3024
01:43:53.670 --> 01:43:55.440 line:15%
that if we killed her, the next day

3025
01:43:55.440 --> 01:43:57.540 line:15%
all of your father's grapes would've died.

3026
01:43:58.946 --> 01:43:59.779 line:15%
(snorting)

3027
01:43:59.779 --> 01:44:01.530 line:15%
Honestly.
You know, it's true.

3028
01:44:01.530 --> 01:44:03.527 line:15%
Or worse.
That's probably

3029
01:44:03.527 --> 01:44:04.730 line:15%
what woulda happened.
But you're not worried

3030
01:44:04.730 --> 01:44:07.540 line:15%
about your family or your safety or anything?

3031
01:44:09.090 --> 01:44:10.700 line:15%
About what?
Well,

3032
01:44:10.700 --> 01:44:13.520 line:15%
she said that there's a price to be paid, right?

3033
01:44:13.520 --> 01:44:14.900 line:15%
A price to be paid

3034
01:44:16.810 --> 01:44:19.658 line:15%
for what your father got.

3035
01:44:19.658 --> 01:44:21.600 line:15%
(mysterious music)

3036
01:44:21.600 --> 01:44:22.938 line:15%
Right.

3037
01:44:22.938 --> 01:44:24.120 line:15%
What're you driving at?
I don't understand

3038
01:44:24.120 --> 01:44:26.160 line:15%
what you're--
Aren't you worried about

3039
01:44:26.160 --> 01:44:27.700 line:15%
anything happen--
Yeah, yeah.

3040
01:44:29.812 --> 01:44:30.645 line:15%
It doesn't matter, don't worry about it.

3041
01:44:32.040 --> 01:44:35.320 line:15%
Should we have killed her?
No, not at all.

3042
01:44:37.110 --> 01:44:38.980 line:15%
I don't think it's a price on

3043
01:44:38.980 --> 01:44:40.980 line:15%
the family, I think it's a price on him.

3044
01:44:42.190 --> 01:44:44.420 line:15%
It's a price on everyone.
Maybe?

3045
01:44:44.420 --> 01:44:45.530 line:15%
Well, I mean, if you're gonna

3046
01:44:45.530 --> 01:44:47.500 line:15%
maybe things, you can maybe anything.

3047
01:44:47.500 --> 01:44:49.570 line:15%
Maybe there is no price.

3048
01:44:49.570 --> 01:44:51.840 line:15%
Maybe it's a price on everyone who works there,

3049
01:44:51.840 --> 01:44:53.400 line:15%
maybe it's no price at all,

3050
01:44:53.400 --> 01:44:55.290 line:15%
maybe it's just 10 bottles of wine.

3051
01:44:56.930 --> 01:44:59.460 line:15%
Maybes are not useful.
That deal was made

3052
01:44:59.460 --> 01:45:02.850 line:15%
so long ago, I would be afraid it would unroot quite a bit.

3053
01:45:03.990 --> 01:45:07.270 line:15%
Maybe you're the price, maybe--

3054
01:45:07.270 --> 01:45:11.650 line:15%
I thought I was.
I'm glad you're not.

3055
01:45:11.650 --> 01:45:13.040 line:15%
Oh--
'Cause you're still here.

3056
01:45:14.090 --> 01:45:17.140 line:15%
Maybe it was his fear and not

3057
01:45:17.140 --> 01:45:19.490 line:15%
being able to--
Oh.

3058
01:45:19.490 --> 01:45:21.760 line:15%
Oh, that's deep.
Thank you.

3059
01:45:21.760 --> 01:45:23.330 line:15%
Wait, what was it?

3060
01:45:24.930 --> 01:45:26.840 line:15%
His fear was the price?
Yeah.

3061
01:45:26.840 --> 01:45:30.590 line:15%
Like what if he made his entire life so miserable

3062
01:45:30.590 --> 01:45:33.340 line:15%
because he was seeking this rich goal

3063
01:45:33.340 --> 01:45:37.060 line:15%
that he ended up making himself miserable and Beau miserable

3064
01:45:37.060 --> 01:45:38.660 line:15%
and all these people around him miserable

3065
01:45:38.660 --> 01:45:40.240 line:15%
and that's what she was feeding off of,

3066
01:45:40.240 --> 01:45:41.990 line:15%
that's the price that he paid?

3067
01:45:41.990 --> 01:45:44.420 line:15%
He didn't get to live a happy life with his wife,

3068
01:45:44.420 --> 01:45:48.940 line:15%
he lived a very sad, sad life.
And drove his daughter away.

3069
01:45:49.945 --> 01:45:53.060 line:15%
And now he has a son.
He'll do the same thing.

3070
01:45:54.290 --> 01:45:56.270 line:15%
Maybe.
I--

3071
01:45:56.270 --> 01:45:58.780 line:15%
Or maybe the price has been paid.

3072
01:45:58.780 --> 01:46:01.180 line:15%
What's done is done, you can't turn back time.

3073
01:46:02.060 --> 01:46:03.580 line:15%
True, and it doesn't seem like it's something

3074
01:46:03.580 --> 01:46:07.550 line:15%
that gets fulfilled, it just sort of seems to keep going.

3075
01:46:07.550 --> 01:46:09.780 line:15%
Is it?
I don't know.

3076
01:46:09.780 --> 01:46:10.613 line:15%
I like having you here.

3077
01:46:10.613 --> 01:46:13.020 line:15%
She said, "The more, the better."

3078
01:46:13.020 --> 01:46:16.210 line:15%
Yeah.
What do you feel like?

3079
01:46:16.210 --> 01:46:18.870 line:15%
Do you feel like your life is being siphoned away?

3080
01:46:18.870 --> 01:46:21.100 line:15%
Do you feel happier right now?

3081
01:46:21.100 --> 01:46:23.250 line:15%
Happier?
Yeah.

3082
01:46:23.250 --> 01:46:25.240 line:15%
Do you feel like somebody's sucking your life force?

3083
01:46:25.240 --> 01:46:26.730 line:15%
I feel like there's a--
I don't feel

3084
01:46:26.730 --> 01:46:28.310 line:15%
that someone's sucking my life force.

3085
01:46:28.310 --> 01:46:30.310 line:15%
I think it was a different deal.

3086
01:46:30.310 --> 01:46:32.240 line:15%
There's a maximum level of happiness

3087
01:46:32.240 --> 01:46:34.820 line:15%
possible when you're ankle-deep in swamp.

3088
01:46:34.820 --> 01:46:38.890 line:15%
I think this is kind of lowering the baseline at the moment.

3089
01:46:38.890 --> 01:46:40.850 line:15%
I--
Hey, hey, hey--

3090
01:46:40.850 --> 01:46:44.290 line:15%
I, honestly, I feel, I feel guilty right now.

3091
01:46:44.290 --> 01:46:45.610 line:15%
Guilty, why?
Because--

3092
01:46:45.610 --> 01:46:47.050 line:15%
Why?
Because

3093
01:46:47.050 --> 01:46:49.290 line:15%
we all went in there, well I don't know, I mean,

3094
01:46:49.290 --> 01:46:51.810 line:15%
you said that you, you had offered to,

3095
01:46:52.950 --> 01:46:56.840 line:15%
to go away from us and live a life of solitude

3096
01:46:56.840 --> 01:47:00.320 line:15%
in order to, to take this curse off of me.

3097
01:47:00.320 --> 01:47:01.153 line:15%
I mean, that was

3098
01:47:02.880 --> 01:47:05.340 line:15%
very brave of you and--

3099
01:47:05.340 --> 01:47:08.760 line:15%
And very not okay.
I mean, it was amazing.

3100
01:47:08.760 --> 01:47:09.940 line:15%
No, I don't think it was.

3101
01:47:09.940 --> 01:47:12.370 line:15%
I disagree with that entirely.

3102
01:47:12.370 --> 01:47:13.203 line:15%
What are you talking about?

3103
01:47:13.203 --> 01:47:14.900 line:15%
It was a sacrifice for her friend.

3104
01:47:14.900 --> 01:47:16.160 line:15%
It would have been a sacrifice

3105
01:47:16.160 --> 01:47:18.250 line:15%
for her and for everyone else.

3106
01:47:18.250 --> 01:47:20.758 line:15%
Beau, you wouldn't have--
For her mostly, though.

3107
01:47:20.758 --> 01:47:21.591 line:15%
Been making yourself miserable.

3108
01:47:21.591 --> 01:47:24.250 line:15%
We would've been--
We would've been miserable.

3109
01:47:25.899 --> 01:47:26.732 line:15%
We would've been so sad.
But she would've been

3110
01:47:26.732 --> 01:47:28.210 line:15%
even more so.
I mean,

3111
01:47:28.210 --> 01:47:31.140 line:15%
we still would've lost a friend in the end, so.

3112
01:47:32.120 --> 01:47:36.100 line:15%
I think the hag pushed us to a lot of ultimate decisions.

3113
01:47:36.100 --> 01:47:38.500 line:15%
Beau was ready to move away from everything,

3114
01:47:38.500 --> 01:47:40.380 line:15%
you were ready to entertain war between nations.

3115
01:47:40.380 --> 01:47:41.213 line:15%
I know, that's what I'm saying.

3116
01:47:41.213 --> 01:47:44.661 line:15%
That, I, the thing that I, I was a coward.

3117
01:47:44.661 --> 01:47:46.541 line:15%
Whisper.
I was a coward.

3118
01:47:46.541 --> 01:47:47.742 line:15%
(gasping)

3119
01:47:47.742 --> 01:47:48.980 line:15%
Sorry, sorry.

3120
01:47:48.980 --> 01:47:49.930 line:15%
You all get quiet for a minute

3121
01:47:49.930 --> 01:47:52.303 line:15%
and you watch as two of these zombies kinda like

3122
01:47:52.303 --> 01:47:55.180 line:15%
(groans) come lumbering through the swamp, wading.

3123
01:47:55.180 --> 01:47:56.470 line:15%
I open the door to the hut

3124
01:47:56.470 --> 01:47:59.160 line:15%
and I just throw one of my ball bearings.

3125
01:47:59.160 --> 01:48:00.390 line:15%
There's no door.
No, there is no door.

3126
01:48:00.390 --> 01:48:01.910 line:15%
Oh, I just reach through and I go

3127
01:48:01.910 --> 01:48:04.130 line:15%
pff and toss a ball bearing.

3128
01:48:04.130 --> 01:48:05.610 line:15%
It's the South, there's a screen door, you just--

3129
01:48:05.610 --> 01:48:06.610 line:15%
Yeah, whatever.

3130
01:48:06.610 --> 01:48:09.595 line:15%
They're both kinda (gasps) and one of them finds the hut

3131
01:48:09.595 --> 01:48:12.245 line:15%
and is kinda scraping against the exterior, shh, shh.

3132
01:48:13.903 --> 01:48:14.736 line:15%
(splashing noise)

3133
01:48:14.736 --> 01:48:16.960 line:15%
(gasps) They both (grunts) and (makes splashing noises).

3134
01:48:18.919 --> 01:48:20.349 line:15%
(imitated scuttling noises)

3135
01:48:20.349 --> 01:48:22.560 line:15%
Can't deal with any distractions right now.

3136
01:48:22.560 --> 01:48:24.910 line:15%
Hey Caleb, can anybody scry on us in the hut?

3137
01:48:26.180 --> 01:48:27.560 line:15%
Well, we are packed pretty tightly

3138
01:48:27.560 --> 01:48:30.080 line:15%
and no one can scry on me, so probably

3139
01:48:30.080 --> 01:48:31.430 line:15%
not at the moment.
Okay.

3140
01:48:33.340 --> 01:48:34.190 line:15%
Just making sure.

3141
01:48:38.193 --> 01:48:39.190 line:15%
What?
Don't go.

3142
01:48:41.910 --> 01:48:44.410 line:15%
Well, I mean, this isn't gonna last forever, right?

3143
01:48:45.920 --> 01:48:47.120 line:15%
So, if--
That doesn't mean

3144
01:48:47.120 --> 01:48:48.820 line:15%
you pull the pin on it.

3145
01:48:48.820 --> 01:48:50.400 line:15%
Follow your own advice.

3146
01:48:52.330 --> 01:48:53.163 line:15%
Don't go.

3147
01:48:56.370 --> 01:48:59.960 line:15%
I know you think you're done, I understand.

3148
01:49:01.000 --> 01:49:03.250 line:15%
You're not done yet.
How do you know?

3149
01:49:04.140 --> 01:49:06.430 line:15%
I know things.
Okay.

3150
01:49:08.030 --> 01:49:10.000 line:15%
That's not an answer, you know that.

3151
01:49:10.000 --> 01:49:11.870 line:15%
All right, I'll answer it: you're young,

3152
01:49:11.870 --> 01:49:15.320 line:15%
you're full of life, you hook up with anything that moves.

3153
01:49:15.320 --> 01:49:17.870 line:15%
You haven't even begun to live your life.

3154
01:49:18.810 --> 01:49:21.180 line:15%
I'm this much older than you and you're ready to quit

3155
01:49:21.180 --> 01:49:23.870 line:15%
and move on from everything that's good in your world?

3156
01:49:27.140 --> 01:49:28.320 line:15%
There's a greatness in you that

3157
01:49:28.320 --> 01:49:31.300 line:15%
you've maybe known three months.

3158
01:49:32.340 --> 01:49:33.740 line:15%
This is just the beginning.

3159
01:49:34.890 --> 01:49:38.370 line:15%
To think that you've peaked is insane.

3160
01:49:38.370 --> 01:49:39.840 line:15%
Well, what are you gonna do?

3161
01:49:40.700 --> 01:49:41.700 line:15%
What are your goals?

3162
01:49:43.920 --> 01:49:46.000 line:15%
To stay with my friends, to see

3163
01:49:46.000 --> 01:49:48.080 line:15%
what happens, to watch over you.

3164
01:49:48.080 --> 01:49:52.440 line:15%
You've watched over me as I've explored my past.

3165
01:49:52.440 --> 01:49:55.120 line:15%
The least I can do is return the favor.

3166
01:49:55.120 --> 01:49:57.940 line:15%
I'm invested now, I want to see peace between these nations,

3167
01:49:57.940 --> 01:50:02.940 line:15%
I want to see what this green cloaked figure is

3168
01:50:02.981 --> 01:50:05.020 line:15%
that Jester keeps talking to--

3169
01:50:05.020 --> 01:50:06.180 line:15%
His name is the Traveler.
I want to see Nott get back

3170
01:50:06.180 --> 01:50:07.819 line:15%
what she wants--
His name is the Traveler--

3171
01:50:07.819 --> 01:50:08.910 line:15%
Yes, the Traveler.
His name's the Traveler

3172
01:50:08.910 --> 01:50:10.130 line:15%
and he's really awesome.
All right, it's fine.

3173
01:50:10.130 --> 01:50:11.880 line:15%
We owe it to each other.
Yeah.

3174
01:50:12.900 --> 01:50:14.160 line:15%
Nott doesn't seem to care about me,

3175
01:50:14.160 --> 01:50:15.850 line:15%
but I care about her, it's okay.

3176
01:50:15.850 --> 01:50:18.311 line:15%
I care about you, Fjord.
Tell me again.

3177
01:50:18.311 --> 01:50:20.561 line:15%
(laughing)

3178
01:50:22.130 --> 01:50:24.720 line:15%
I care about you, Fjord, I care about all of you.

3179
01:50:27.010 --> 01:50:29.460 line:15%
You all would've sacrificed so much for me.

3180
01:50:29.460 --> 01:50:33.190 line:15%
You did, you risked your life in there.

3181
01:50:33.190 --> 01:50:35.080 line:15%
She could've seen through your little spell

3182
01:50:35.080 --> 01:50:37.810 line:15%
and taken off your cute little head.

3183
01:50:37.810 --> 01:50:41.070 line:15%
Well, she would've taken off my cute little hands faster.

3184
01:50:42.110 --> 01:50:44.730 line:15%
That's bad, too.
Yeah,

3185
01:50:44.730 --> 01:50:47.230 line:15%
we woulda come running in at the first yelp.

3186
01:50:48.660 --> 01:50:51.210 line:15%
If we could.
We're not done until

3187
01:50:51.210 --> 01:50:52.043 line:15%
we've saved each other.
I don't know what's

3188
01:50:52.043 --> 01:50:53.210 line:15%
going on in that hut, you guys.

3189
01:50:53.210 --> 01:50:56.890 line:15%
And why would we have come running in at the first yelp?

3190
01:50:56.890 --> 01:51:01.120 line:15%
Your delts are crazy.
Thank you.

3191
01:51:01.120 --> 01:51:03.290 line:15%
Why, why would we have come running in?

3192
01:51:03.290 --> 01:51:05.280 line:15%
Because we care about each other.

3193
01:51:05.280 --> 01:51:06.800 line:15%
Oh, fucking shit, we do?

3194
01:51:06.800 --> 01:51:08.800 line:15%
Amazing, does that apply to you as well?

3195
01:51:09.714 --> 01:51:11.473 line:15%
I don't know.
Oh, I think it does.

3196
01:51:11.473 --> 01:51:14.520 line:15%
(laughing)

3197
01:51:14.520 --> 01:51:15.750 line:15%
Don't do that again.

3198
01:51:18.610 --> 01:51:20.410 line:15%
Don't you care what happens to Nott?

3199
01:51:23.200 --> 01:51:25.420 line:15%
Don't do that again.
I guess.

3200
01:51:25.420 --> 01:51:26.920 line:15%
Jester.
I guess.

3201
01:51:26.920 --> 01:51:27.940 line:15%
Yasha.
Okay.

3202
01:51:27.940 --> 01:51:29.160 line:15%
This one.
Yeah.

3203
01:51:29.160 --> 01:51:30.310 line:15%
Most of all.
Mleh.

3204
01:51:35.289 --> 01:51:36.577 line:15%
I love you guys.

3205
01:51:36.577 --> 01:51:37.610 line:15%
(laughing)

3206
01:51:37.610 --> 01:51:38.660 line:15%
We did really good.

3207
01:51:40.449 --> 01:51:42.790 line:15%
That was crazy, you should've seen her up there on the roof.

3208
01:51:42.790 --> 01:51:44.781 line:15%
Bitch had four elbows.

3209
01:51:44.781 --> 01:51:45.614 line:15%
(laughing)

3210
01:51:45.614 --> 01:51:46.880 line:15%
It's not normal.

3211
01:51:46.880 --> 01:51:50.044 line:15%
I saw it, I like, literally, I have to do a poop check.

3212
01:51:50.044 --> 01:51:51.240 line:15%
(laughing)

3213
01:51:51.240 --> 01:51:54.051 line:15%
I want to do it here but we're all trapped in this bubble.

3214
01:51:54.051 --> 01:51:55.540 line:15%
Nott still has poop on her leg from--

3215
01:51:57.287 --> 01:51:58.425 line:15%
Yeah.
What was that from, again?

3216
01:51:58.425 --> 01:51:59.700 line:15%
(wheezing laughter)

3217
01:51:59.700 --> 01:52:01.110 line:15%
From seeing the hag.
Oh.

3218
01:52:01.110 --> 01:52:02.960 line:15%
Yep.
I don't wanna look.

3219
01:52:02.960 --> 01:52:05.331 line:15%
I don't wanna break the seal and we'll all be fucked.

3220
01:52:05.331 --> 01:52:07.581 line:15%
(laughing)

3221
01:52:10.470 --> 01:52:11.920 line:15%
Anyway, we just got this one back,

3222
01:52:11.920 --> 01:52:13.220 line:15%
we don't need to lose one.

3223
01:52:15.190 --> 01:52:16.070 line:15%
Nobody goes.

3224
01:52:18.310 --> 01:52:19.143 line:15%
Okay.

3225
01:52:23.570 --> 01:52:26.160 line:15%
Okay.
Good.

3226
01:52:26.160 --> 01:52:29.700 line:15%
Do you think my brother's destined

3227
01:52:29.700 --> 01:52:32.220 line:15%
for a life of misery, though?

3228
01:52:32.220 --> 01:52:34.590 line:15%
Well, maybe you can break him from that.

3229
01:52:36.190 --> 01:52:37.140 line:15%
Maybe there are other ways.

3230
01:52:37.140 --> 01:52:38.030 line:15%
I mean--
Like how?

3231
01:52:38.030 --> 01:52:39.842 line:15%
Do you wanna kidnap him?
No, but--

3232
01:52:39.842 --> 01:52:40.940 line:15%
Maybe?
I was kinda,

3233
01:52:40.940 --> 01:52:42.210 line:15%
I was kinda thinkin' about it.

3234
01:52:42.210 --> 01:52:43.043 line:15%
Look at the fuzz on your chin.

3235
01:52:43.043 --> 01:52:43.876 line:15%
That's not a bad idea.
Wait.

3236
01:52:43.876 --> 01:52:45.250 line:15%
Did you say kidnap him?
Yeah,

3237
01:52:45.250 --> 01:52:46.430 line:15%
what if we just suddenly take him?

3238
01:52:46.430 --> 01:52:48.920 line:15%
Well she, I mean, Beauregard said something interesting.

3239
01:52:48.920 --> 01:52:51.760 line:15%
She said, "Oh Luc and my brother," what is his name?

3240
01:52:51.760 --> 01:52:53.690 line:15%
JT? TJ?
TJ.

3241
01:52:53.690 --> 01:52:54.800 line:15%
TJ.
Thoreau, Jr.

3242
01:52:54.800 --> 01:52:58.300 line:15%
My dad's got an ego.
Luc and TJ could be friends.

3243
01:52:58.300 --> 01:53:00.950 line:15%
What if just went back and kidnapped your brother

3244
01:53:00.950 --> 01:53:02.250 line:15%
and took him to live--
(gasps) What if we

3245
01:53:02.250 --> 01:53:06.933 line:15%
go up there, I Dimension Door in, I snag him up, bamf out--

3246
01:53:06.933 --> 01:53:11.933 line:15%
Maybe TJ is going to reach an age and he'll reach out

3247
01:53:12.370 --> 01:53:13.930 line:15%
and you'll be there to get him out of

3248
01:53:13.930 --> 01:53:15.010 line:15%
a bad situation.
It's true.

3249
01:53:15.010 --> 01:53:18.040 line:15%
Nothing makes siblings connect faster

3250
01:53:18.040 --> 01:53:20.250 line:15%
than shitty parents.
That's true.

3251
01:53:21.530 --> 01:53:25.540 line:15%
Plus, I have a good way of talking with angsty teens, so.

3252
01:53:26.720 --> 01:53:28.770 line:15%
Just have to wait 10 years and--

3253
01:53:28.770 --> 01:53:29.772 line:15%
(laughing)

3254
01:53:29.772 --> 01:53:31.560 line:15%
Yeah, yeah.
Really connect.

3255
01:53:32.670 --> 01:53:35.960 line:15%
And he's probably safer there than, you know, taking,

3256
01:53:35.960 --> 01:53:38.630 line:15%
we can't take a baby on the road with us, you know?

3257
01:53:38.630 --> 01:53:40.280 line:15%
We barely scared Kiri.
He's with his mother.

3258
01:53:40.280 --> 01:53:41.390 line:15%
Kiri turned out great, okay?

3259
01:53:41.390 --> 01:53:43.500 line:15%
He's behind shatterproof glass.

3260
01:53:43.500 --> 01:53:44.720 line:15%
His mother, is your mother

3261
01:53:44.720 --> 01:53:46.540 line:15%
caring at all?
She's walkin' around

3262
01:53:46.540 --> 01:53:48.030 line:15%
with a dagger, telling people to go fuck herself.

3263
01:53:48.030 --> 01:53:48.863 line:15%
(laughing)

3264
01:53:48.863 --> 01:53:50.410 line:15%
Themselves.

3265
01:53:50.410 --> 01:53:52.490 line:15%
She's caring when she,

3266
01:53:53.900 --> 01:53:56.920 line:15%
she's caring, yeah, she cares.

3267
01:53:56.920 --> 01:54:00.060 line:15%
I bet when your dad isn't around, your mom's cool.

3268
01:54:01.370 --> 01:54:04.980 line:15%
That's kind of exactly it, yeah.

3269
01:54:07.810 --> 01:54:10.840 line:15%
What if when your mom's not around, is that okay?

3270
01:54:14.345 --> 01:54:15.630 line:15%
I think it's a little different.

3271
01:54:17.180 --> 01:54:20.740 line:15%
If you're talkin' about yourself, it is 100% different

3272
01:54:20.740 --> 01:54:23.640 line:15%
and do not fuckin' compare yourself to my parents.

3273
01:54:23.640 --> 01:54:25.770 line:15%
Well, I'm totally absent right now.

3274
01:54:25.770 --> 01:54:27.920 line:15%
But there's a difference between

3275
01:54:27.920 --> 01:54:30.750 line:15%
pursuing the things that make you happy

3276
01:54:30.750 --> 01:54:33.340 line:15%
and showing that and being an example to your kids

3277
01:54:33.340 --> 01:54:35.190 line:15%
and then just totally fucking being

3278
01:54:35.190 --> 01:54:38.090 line:15%
so self absorbed in your own damage that you

3279
01:54:38.090 --> 01:54:41.734 line:15%
just transfer all of that in neglect to them.

3280
01:54:41.734 --> 01:54:43.620 line:15%
That's very well put, actually.

3281
01:54:43.620 --> 01:54:46.750 line:15%
That's really well put.
What were your parents like?

3282
01:54:46.750 --> 01:54:49.538 line:15%
What was your mom's name?

3283
01:54:49.538 --> 01:54:51.630 line:15%
(laughing)

3284
01:54:51.630 --> 01:54:52.463 line:15%
Wow.

3285
01:54:52.463 --> 01:54:54.666 line:15%
(laughing)

3286
01:54:57.110 --> 01:54:58.394 line:15%
Chef's kiss.

3287
01:54:58.394 --> 01:54:59.285 line:15%
(laughing)

3288
01:54:59.285 --> 01:55:01.420 line:15%
I have lovely parents.
Yeah.

3289
01:55:01.420 --> 01:55:03.195 line:15%
Ashley was her name.

3290
01:55:03.195 --> 01:55:04.410 line:15%
(laughing)

3291
01:55:04.410 --> 01:55:08.959 line:15%
Everyone write that down.
It was easy to remember.

3292
01:55:08.959 --> 01:55:09.792 line:15%
(laughing)

3293
01:55:09.792 --> 01:55:11.660 line:15%
And your father?
Travis.

3294
01:55:11.660 --> 01:55:13.910 line:15%
(laughing)

3295
01:55:15.470 --> 01:55:16.640 line:15%
Oh, they sound, those are the most--

3296
01:55:16.640 --> 01:55:18.764 line:15%
Canon.
Those are great names.

3297
01:55:18.764 --> 01:55:20.800 line:15%
Those are really good names.
Strong, strong names.

3298
01:55:20.800 --> 01:55:22.420 line:15%
Warrior's names.

3299
01:55:22.420 --> 01:55:24.110 line:15%
I had three older brothers who

3300
01:55:24.110 --> 01:55:26.600 line:15%
I didn't get along with too well,

3301
01:55:26.600 --> 01:55:28.730 line:15%
but my parents were loving and kind and--

3302
01:55:29.790 --> 01:55:31.950 line:15%
My parents would take long trips.

3303
01:55:34.080 --> 01:55:34.913 line:15%
Wait, yeah?

3304
01:55:34.913 --> 01:55:35.990 line:15%
Okay.
I mean, we were--

3305
01:55:35.990 --> 01:55:38.770 line:15%
How did you cope with that?
Very well.

3306
01:55:38.770 --> 01:55:41.110 line:15%
We would, we had a close family

3307
01:55:41.110 --> 01:55:44.500 line:15%
and pilgrimages and leaving home to

3308
01:55:46.590 --> 01:55:50.420 line:15%
check in on other people was pretty common.

3309
01:55:50.420 --> 01:55:52.770 line:15%
They'd be gone months at a time sometimes.

3310
01:55:52.770 --> 01:55:55.030 line:15%
Your parents?
And my aunt.

3311
01:55:55.030 --> 01:55:58.060 line:15%
Not all at once, obviously, but yes.

3312
01:55:58.060 --> 01:55:59.500 line:15%
Eventually, every now and then,

3313
01:55:59.500 --> 01:56:02.800 line:15%
some of my siblings would go, too.

3314
01:56:02.800 --> 01:56:06.820 line:15%
I would've eventually gone for things longer than two weeks

3315
01:56:06.820 --> 01:56:09.180 line:15%
to get supplies, but--
Was it lonely?

3316
01:56:09.180 --> 01:56:10.990 line:15%
Did you miss them?
Well,

3317
01:56:10.990 --> 01:56:12.790 line:15%
I missed them, but it wasn't lonely.

3318
01:56:13.880 --> 01:56:15.280 line:15%
How did you know that they still

3319
01:56:15.280 --> 01:56:16.830 line:15%
loved you while they were gone?

3320
01:56:18.360 --> 01:56:19.970 line:15%
Absence

3321
01:56:19.970 --> 01:56:24.730 line:15%
isn't the opposite of love.

3322
01:56:24.730 --> 01:56:28.560 line:15%
Plenty of ways to show someone you don't love them

3323
01:56:28.560 --> 01:56:30.400 line:15%
that don't involve not being there.

3324
01:56:31.570 --> 01:56:34.070 line:15%
Being off and doing good work was important.

3325
01:56:35.430 --> 01:56:37.730 line:15%
That's what we did as a family.

3326
01:56:41.870 --> 01:56:43.570 line:15%
They were being their best selves.

3327
01:56:44.990 --> 01:56:49.750 line:15%
My dad wasn't around and he was off doing work and--

3328
01:56:49.750 --> 01:56:50.583 line:15%
Well.

3329
01:56:50.583 --> 01:56:53.020 line:15%
Sure.
He was doing work.

3330
01:56:54.010 --> 01:56:54.843 line:15%
But--
He was

3331
01:56:54.843 --> 01:56:56.860 line:15%
very successful at the work he did, no doubt.

3332
01:56:58.360 --> 01:56:59.193 line:15%
Yeah.
Yeah.

3333
01:56:59.193 --> 01:57:00.460 line:15%
And you know what, though?

3334
01:57:00.460 --> 01:57:04.490 line:15%
My mom always told me if he could be here, he would,

3335
01:57:04.490 --> 01:57:08.290 line:15%
and that if he knew me, he would love the shit out of me.

3336
01:57:08.290 --> 01:57:10.870 line:15%
She didn't say it exactly like that, but.

3337
01:57:12.050 --> 01:57:13.660 line:15%
You know, your husband is telling

3338
01:57:13.660 --> 01:57:15.860 line:15%
your son how much you love him.

3339
01:57:18.780 --> 01:57:19.880 line:15%
But I--
He knows.

3340
01:57:23.340 --> 01:57:26.880 line:15%
But I could be there, I can, as soon as we want.

3341
01:57:27.880 --> 01:57:30.200 line:15%
Yeah.
That's true of anything.

3342
01:57:30.200 --> 01:57:31.300 line:15%
That's true right now.

3343
01:57:32.660 --> 01:57:34.230 line:15%
You could have been there this whole time, though.

3344
01:57:34.230 --> 01:57:35.530 line:15%
That's true a month ago.

3345
01:57:37.950 --> 01:57:41.770 line:15%
It's pretty obvious that Yeza would accept you as you are.

3346
01:57:45.280 --> 01:57:47.580 line:15%
You're also making boatloads of cash,

3347
01:57:47.580 --> 01:57:51.400 line:15%
which can totally go towards a great scholarship

3348
01:57:51.400 --> 01:57:53.970 line:15%
and a retirement fund, you know?

3349
01:57:53.970 --> 01:57:54.803 line:15%
Braces are not cheap these days.

3350
01:57:54.803 --> 01:57:57.270 line:15%
Absolutely.
Fjord knows.

3351
01:57:57.270 --> 01:57:58.508 line:15%
You don't want,

3352
01:57:58.508 --> 01:58:00.200 line:15%
(laughing)

3353
01:58:00.200 --> 01:58:02.030 line:15%
you don't want Luc filing down his own teeth.

3354
01:58:02.030 --> 01:58:03.360 line:15%
Yeah.
That shit hurts.

3355
01:58:03.360 --> 01:58:04.560 line:15%
No, I don't.
True that.

3356
01:58:05.530 --> 01:58:08.660 line:15%
They look good, though, they're lookin' real good.

3357
01:58:08.660 --> 01:58:10.130 line:15%
Thanks, Jester.
But what if I,

3358
01:58:10.130 --> 01:58:13.470 line:15%
what if when I change, if I, when I change back,

3359
01:58:13.470 --> 01:58:18.420 line:15%
what if I don't, what if I don't wanna stay with you guys?

3360
01:58:19.780 --> 01:58:21.210 line:15%
Then you don't have to.
You don't have to,

3361
01:58:21.210 --> 01:58:22.670 line:15%
that's okay, but just make sure

3362
01:58:22.670 --> 01:58:24.810 line:15%
you're doing it for the right reasons.

3363
01:58:24.810 --> 01:58:26.840 line:15%
It's important that you know that we want you to,

3364
01:58:26.840 --> 01:58:29.900 line:15%
but your decision matters the most.

3365
01:58:29.900 --> 01:58:32.290 line:15%
And if you don't stay with us,

3366
01:58:35.210 --> 01:58:36.500 line:15%
we'll know you love us.

3367
01:58:42.310 --> 01:58:43.143 line:15%
Mmhm.

3368
01:58:45.650 --> 01:58:49.210 line:15%
Does thinking about going back home and having

3369
01:58:50.460 --> 01:58:54.260 line:15%
a family life, is that an exciting thought to you?

3370
01:58:58.329 --> 01:58:59.162 line:15%
(sighs) Yes and no.

3371
01:58:59.162 --> 01:59:02.560 line:15%
I mean, yes, of course, I wanna be with my family.

3372
01:59:04.780 --> 01:59:07.840 line:15%
They need me, I need to be with them and

3373
01:59:11.160 --> 01:59:12.990 line:15%
it's all I've wanted for so long but

3374
01:59:15.150 --> 01:59:16.970 line:15%
just to go back and to be a,

3375
01:59:20.580 --> 01:59:22.800 line:15%
a supporting player in my story

3376
01:59:25.360 --> 01:59:30.360 line:15%
doesn't seem, I don't know how I would feel about that.

3377
01:59:30.530 --> 01:59:34.870 line:15%
I mean, we've had so many amazing adventures together.

3378
01:59:34.870 --> 01:59:36.270 line:15%
You tried to kill me.
I--

3379
01:59:37.625 --> 01:59:39.425 line:15%
And that's crazy, that's exciting.

3380
01:59:40.732 --> 01:59:42.360 line:15%
Did, I, Nott, I didn't.
Well, I mean--

3381
01:59:42.360 --> 01:59:44.270 line:15%
You've tried to kill me a couple times.

3382
01:59:44.270 --> 01:59:45.900 line:15%
I almost did kill you.
No, you've tried to kill,

3383
01:59:45.900 --> 01:59:48.200 line:15%
you've actually, you've, you've, you've,

3384
01:59:48.200 --> 01:59:49.900 line:15%
I think you stabbed me a few times.

3385
01:59:49.900 --> 01:59:52.470 line:15%
Oh, I'm sure, yes.
Beau has shot me in the ass.

3386
01:59:52.470 --> 01:59:55.389 line:15%
Sorry, Nott has shot Beau in the ass.

3387
01:59:55.389 --> 01:59:56.880 line:15%
(laughing)

3388
01:59:56.880 --> 01:59:58.450 line:15%
You're Beau.
I'm Beau.

3389
01:59:59.580 --> 02:00:03.430 line:15%
I'm exhausted, literally.
Literally.

3390
02:00:03.430 --> 02:00:04.659 line:15%
Sorry.

3391
02:00:04.659 --> 02:00:05.492 line:15%
(laughing)
(talking over each other)

3392
02:00:05.492 --> 02:00:06.857 line:15%
(groaning)

3393
02:00:06.857 --> 02:00:08.741 line:15%
Shh shh shh.

3394
02:00:08.741 --> 02:00:10.886 line:15%
I throw another ball bearing.

3395
02:00:10.886 --> 02:00:12.040 line:15%
(chuckling)

3396
02:00:12.040 --> 02:00:12.999 line:15%
(groaning)

3397
02:00:12.999 --> 02:00:13.832 line:15%
(laughing)

3398
02:00:13.832 --> 02:00:14.841 line:15%
(gulping)

3399
02:00:14.841 --> 02:00:16.183 line:15%
(choking)

3400
02:00:16.183 --> 02:00:17.051 line:15%
(imitated exploding)

3401
02:00:17.051 --> 02:00:19.750 line:15%
(laughing)

3402
02:00:19.750 --> 02:00:20.583 line:15%
Shit.

3403
02:00:20.583 --> 02:00:21.637 line:15%
(laughing)

3404
02:00:21.637 --> 02:00:22.733 line:15%
You got the wrong white person.

3405
02:00:22.733 --> 02:00:24.530 line:15%
(laughing)

3406
02:00:24.530 --> 02:00:27.943 line:15%
I just don't know how, I don't know how to manage it.

3407
02:00:27.943 --> 02:00:29.341 line:15%
Not knowing the Heimlich, the most deadly thing.

3408
02:00:29.341 --> 02:00:30.174 line:15%
(laughing)

3409
02:00:30.174 --> 02:00:32.240 line:15%
I do want to be with them, of course I wanna be with them,

3410
02:00:32.240 --> 02:00:34.410 line:15%
and I'm worried that when I get to

3411
02:00:34.410 --> 02:00:36.980 line:15%
be with them again, I won't want to leave.

3412
02:00:36.980 --> 02:00:39.830 line:15%
And if I do, I'll feel shitty about it.

3413
02:00:39.830 --> 02:00:42.840 line:15%
And when I'm with you, I'll feel great,

3414
02:00:42.840 --> 02:00:44.940 line:15%
but I'll also feel a little bit shitty

3415
02:00:44.940 --> 02:00:47.720 line:15%
and when I'm with them, I'll feel great

3416
02:00:47.720 --> 02:00:49.450 line:15%
but also kind of a little bit shitty.

3417
02:00:49.450 --> 02:00:52.620 line:15%
And I'm not brave enough to do either.

3418
02:00:53.665 --> 02:00:56.610 line:15%
I think, I've been thinking this for a while now,

3419
02:00:58.820 --> 02:01:03.120 line:15%
there is a truth to the idea that you coulda gone back

3420
02:01:03.120 --> 02:01:04.500 line:15%
at any time.
Mmhm.

3421
02:01:06.680 --> 02:01:11.680 line:15%
Have you ever really taken some sober quiet time

3422
02:01:12.070 --> 02:01:14.470 line:15%
to think about what it is that you actually want

3423
02:01:15.307 --> 02:01:16.948 line:15%
and not what you think you should want?

3424
02:01:16.948 --> 02:01:18.620 line:15%
(gasping)

3425
02:01:18.620 --> 02:01:20.520 line:15%
Sober's not my thing, really.

3426
02:01:22.134 --> 02:01:24.560 line:15%
Well.
If it's possible to just sit

3427
02:01:24.560 --> 02:01:27.750 line:15%
and really try and clear your mind and

3428
02:01:30.000 --> 02:01:35.000 line:15%
figure out what it is that would bring you the most peace.

3429
02:01:35.920 --> 02:01:38.420 line:15%
I've never really been religious or anything,

3430
02:01:38.420 --> 02:01:40.390 line:15%
but do you think I should sit and--

3431
02:01:40.390 --> 02:01:41.280 line:15%
Pray to the Traveler?

3432
02:01:41.280 --> 02:01:44.880 line:15%
Definitely.
I was going to suggest

3433
02:01:44.880 --> 02:01:47.430 line:15%
maybe some quiet meditation, but.

3434
02:01:47.430 --> 02:01:48.670 line:15%
Is that something you can do

3435
02:01:48.670 --> 02:01:51.830 line:15%
without believing in some god thing?

3436
02:01:51.830 --> 02:01:52.663 line:15%
To just sit--

3437
02:01:52.663 --> 02:01:54.390 line:15%
Only have to believe in quiet.

3438
02:01:54.390 --> 02:01:56.757 line:15%
I could teach you that.
Oh yeah?

3439
02:01:56.757 --> 02:01:58.490 line:15%
Yeah.
I mean, I--

3440
02:01:58.490 --> 02:02:00.200 line:15%
It's like monk 101 shit.

3441
02:02:02.840 --> 02:02:05.020 line:15%
A Skillshare class?
Yeah.

3442
02:02:06.130 --> 02:02:07.960 line:15%
It's 75 gold.
You only

3443
02:02:07.960 --> 02:02:08.866 line:15%
have to believe in yourself.

3444
02:02:08.866 --> 02:02:09.699 line:15%
(laughing)

3445
02:02:09.699 --> 02:02:11.430 line:15%
It's a subscription service.

3446
02:02:11.430 --> 02:02:12.519 line:15%
(laughing)

3447
02:02:12.519 --> 02:02:14.210 line:15%
I thought monk 101 was horse ass-slapping.

3448
02:02:14.210 --> 02:02:16.770 line:15%
That's another Skillshare course.

3449
02:02:16.770 --> 02:02:18.590 line:15%
You learn a lot in 101.
Yeah.

3450
02:02:18.590 --> 02:02:20.955 line:15%
Yeah.
The first year's a bitch.

3451
02:02:20.955 --> 02:02:21.788 line:15%
(laughing)

3452
02:02:21.788 --> 02:02:22.888 line:15%
Backpack's super heavy.

3453
02:02:22.888 --> 02:02:24.520 line:15%
(laughing)

3454
02:02:24.520 --> 02:02:25.865 line:15%
Fucking Cobalt

3455
02:02:25.865 --> 02:02:26.698 line:15%
(laughing)

3456
02:02:26.698 --> 02:02:30.134 line:15%
class load.
Let's jog a mile first.

3457
02:02:30.134 --> 02:02:31.380 line:15%
(laughing)

3458
02:02:31.380 --> 02:02:33.380 line:15%
All right, maybe if we have some time.

3459
02:02:33.380 --> 02:02:35.500 line:15%
I mean, we're in the swamp of doom here, we can't--

3460
02:02:35.500 --> 02:02:38.340 line:15%
We're also pressed like sardines because we don't have,

3461
02:02:38.340 --> 02:02:39.850 line:15%
oh no, we cleared it, we cleared it--

3462
02:02:39.850 --> 02:02:41.680 line:15%
You cleared it, you got space.

3463
02:02:41.680 --> 02:02:42.513 line:15%
Well, it's pretty tight.
We could do this right now.

3464
02:02:42.513 --> 02:02:44.570 line:15%
But we're really close because we're whispering, so.

3465
02:02:44.570 --> 02:02:46.490 line:15%
Need a little more--
Meditation is about

3466
02:02:46.490 --> 02:02:51.047 line:15%
blocking out everything around you and your head and just--

3467
02:02:53.690 --> 02:02:54.760 line:15%
All right.
I can help.

3468
02:02:54.760 --> 02:02:56.440 line:15%
I'll just, yeah, I'll just poke.

3469
02:02:56.440 --> 02:02:57.990 line:15%
I'll just poke Nott the whole time.

3470
02:02:57.990 --> 02:03:00.390 line:15%
That's high level meditation, that's like--

3471
02:03:00.390 --> 02:03:02.540 line:15%
She's not ready for that.
A challenge.

3472
02:03:02.540 --> 02:03:04.350 line:15%
Should I get drunk first or--

3473
02:03:04.350 --> 02:03:05.183 line:15%
No.
No, no.

3474
02:03:06.037 --> 02:03:08.840 line:15%
You really shouldn't--
That will make it hard.

3475
02:03:08.840 --> 02:03:12.420 line:15%
I appreciate that sentiment and I know where you're goin',

3476
02:03:12.420 --> 02:03:14.440 line:15%
but no.
Maybe you should

3477
02:03:15.280 --> 02:03:20.280 line:15%
skip that flask for a few days and think about it.

3478
02:03:20.680 --> 02:03:21.920 line:15%
What is it considered?

3479
02:03:21.920 --> 02:03:24.840 line:15%
Does it make you wise when you are meditating?

3480
02:03:26.286 --> 02:03:27.400 line:15%
Do you wanna try it with me?

3481
02:03:28.400 --> 02:03:30.760 line:15%
Am I about to lead the group in a group meditation?

3482
02:03:30.760 --> 02:03:33.460 line:15%
Fuck yes, let's do that.
All right, all right.

3483
02:03:33.460 --> 02:03:34.700 line:15%
Who wants to meditate?
I do.

3484
02:03:34.700 --> 02:03:37.380 line:15%
I'm always down.
It's a yoga class

3485
02:03:37.380 --> 02:03:39.711 line:15%
in a zombie field.
This is a first.

3486
02:03:39.711 --> 02:03:40.544 line:15%
(laughing)

3487
02:03:40.544 --> 02:03:41.520 line:15%
This is a first.
Which, mind you,

3488
02:03:41.520 --> 02:03:44.820 line:15%
the space in here is very much like a sleepover.

3489
02:03:44.820 --> 02:03:47.680 line:15%
You're all are kinda Tetris-ed in this interior space.

3490
02:03:47.680 --> 02:03:49.350 line:15%
I'll also say that we all are exhausted,

3491
02:03:49.350 --> 02:03:50.490 line:15%
so this is gonna be really hard.

3492
02:03:50.490 --> 02:03:51.748 line:15%
Yeah, everyone's just gonna fall asleep.

3493
02:03:51.748 --> 02:03:52.581 line:15%
Yeah.

3494
02:03:52.581 --> 02:03:53.720 line:15%
(laughing)
(imitated falling noises)

3495
02:03:53.720 --> 02:03:56.840 line:15%
But I'm going to wait before we do this.

3496
02:03:57.700 --> 02:03:58.580 line:15%
Do we need a word?
What? No.

3497
02:03:58.580 --> 02:04:00.650 line:15%
No.
Like a chanting word?

3498
02:04:00.650 --> 02:04:01.710 line:15%
Don't you have a--
That's a

3499
02:04:01.710 --> 02:04:03.000 line:15%
monkey chant, that's different.

3500
02:04:03.000 --> 02:04:04.754 line:15%
A monkey chant?
Yeah.

3501
02:04:04.754 --> 02:04:06.020 line:15%
(grunting)

3502
02:04:06.020 --> 02:04:07.387 line:15%
Good callback.

3503
02:04:07.387 --> 02:04:09.950 line:15%
Like a monk apostrophe Y or a monkey chant?

3504
02:04:09.950 --> 02:04:14.950 line:15%
No, like a monkey, but I appreciate that as well, yeah.

3505
02:04:14.950 --> 02:04:17.860 line:15%
But isn't there, I've heard or read or whatever,

3506
02:04:17.860 --> 02:04:19.420 line:15%
don't you have to say a word

3507
02:04:19.420 --> 02:04:20.520 line:15%
over and over to lull yourself--

3508
02:04:20.520 --> 02:04:22.190 line:15%
I think that's called something else.

3509
02:04:22.190 --> 02:04:24.430 line:15%
That's somethin' else.
I mean, there's many ways

3510
02:04:24.430 --> 02:04:27.320 line:15%
of meditation, there's no real right way.

3511
02:04:27.320 --> 02:04:30.810 line:15%
It kinda depends on what works best

3512
02:04:30.810 --> 02:04:32.750 line:15%
for you and your inner peace.

3513
02:04:32.750 --> 02:04:34.440 line:15%
All right, take us through it.

3514
02:04:34.440 --> 02:04:37.120 line:15%
I'm going to, hold on, before we do this,

3515
02:04:38.360 --> 02:04:43.320 line:15%
I'm going to cast Enhance Ability at third level

3516
02:04:45.410 --> 02:04:46.243 line:15%
on Nott.

3517
02:04:47.690 --> 02:04:48.911 line:15%
Guidance.

3518
02:04:48.911 --> 02:04:51.040 line:15%
(laughing)

3519
02:04:51.040 --> 02:04:53.890 line:15%
And also myself because the whole time we're doin' this,

3520
02:04:53.890 --> 02:04:58.020 line:15%
I'm keeping an eye out for anything coming through the mist.

3521
02:04:58.020 --> 02:04:59.620 line:15%
Okay.
I'm watching as well.

3522
02:04:59.620 --> 02:05:01.790 line:15%
Enhance Ability on which ability?

3523
02:05:01.790 --> 02:05:04.493 line:15%
Owl's Wisdom.
Okay, you got it.

3524
02:05:04.493 --> 02:05:05.340 line:15%
(whispering)

3525
02:05:05.340 --> 02:05:06.540 line:15%
Make a perception check.

3526
02:05:09.078 --> 02:05:10.996 line:15%
Advantage.
Mmhm.

3527
02:05:10.996 --> 02:05:13.040 line:15%
(dice clacking)

3528
02:05:13.040 --> 02:05:14.212 line:15%
Guide me.

3529
02:05:14.212 --> 02:05:15.290 line:15%
(dice clattering)

3530
02:05:15.290 --> 02:05:17.350 line:15%
Ooh hoo, that's good.

3531
02:05:20.840 --> 02:05:22.130 line:15%
25.

3532
02:05:22.130 --> 02:05:25.160 line:15%
25, you're keeping watch on 'em.

3533
02:05:25.160 --> 02:05:29.700 line:15%
The heavy cluster of these undead that had found you,

3534
02:05:29.700 --> 02:05:32.350 line:15%
it's taken a long time, like the past hour and a half or so

3535
02:05:32.350 --> 02:05:33.700 line:15%
that you guys have been kinda waiting and talking

3536
02:05:33.700 --> 02:05:36.780 line:15%
and catching up a bit, they've been slowly dissipating.

3537
02:05:36.780 --> 02:05:38.780 line:15%
There's maybe a handful that are visible

3538
02:05:39.623 --> 02:05:41.553 line:15%
about maybe a hundred feet away or more

3539
02:05:41.553 --> 02:05:43.500 line:15%
and even then, just barely through the mist

3540
02:05:43.500 --> 02:05:45.110 line:15%
and only because you rolled so high.

3541
02:05:45.110 --> 02:05:46.540 line:15%
But you don't see any immediate danger,

3542
02:05:46.540 --> 02:05:47.890 line:15%
you haven't drawn any immediate attention,

3543
02:05:47.890 --> 02:05:49.540 line:15%
and for the time being, you feel safe.

3544
02:05:51.160 --> 02:05:52.810 line:15%
Are you gonna guide them through a meditation?

3545
02:05:53.750 --> 02:05:56.190 line:15%
Everyone lay on your back.
Oh, we're laying down?

3546
02:05:56.190 --> 02:05:57.400 line:15%
I'm gonna--
Yeah, I'm going this way.

3547
02:05:57.400 --> 02:05:59.070 line:15%
I'm gonna do, yeah.
I'm gonna sit.

3548
02:05:59.070 --> 02:06:00.470 line:15%
I'm gonna sit so I can keep watch.

3549
02:06:00.470 --> 02:06:02.670 line:15%
Close eyes, open eyes?
Close your eyes.

3550
02:06:04.330 --> 02:06:06.500 line:15%
Just being to focus on your breathing.

3551
02:06:06.500 --> 02:06:07.980 line:15%
I feel itchy.
No, don't,

3552
02:06:07.980 --> 02:06:10.330 line:15%
you push it out--
You are the worst.

3553
02:06:10.330 --> 02:06:11.163 line:15%
Of your brain.

3554
02:06:12.500 --> 02:06:16.910 line:15%
Try not to move, try not to touch anything.

3555
02:06:17.990 --> 02:06:21.530 line:15%
Just try to release.
I am thinking

3556
02:06:21.530 --> 02:06:23.830 line:15%
so many things now--
Stop, shut up, Caleb.

3557
02:06:23.830 --> 02:06:26.435 line:15%
God fuckin', all right.

3558
02:06:26.435 --> 02:06:27.702 line:15%
(groaning)

3559
02:06:27.702 --> 02:06:29.230 line:15%
(sighing)

3560
02:06:29.230 --> 02:06:31.590 line:15%
Ignore the fuckin' undead, okay?

3561
02:06:31.590 --> 02:06:33.680 line:15%
Sorry, sorry.
Ball bearing.

3562
02:06:33.680 --> 02:06:35.790 line:15%
This is the perfect place to meditate.

3563
02:06:37.990 --> 02:06:39.300 line:15%
I don't know what it looks like,

3564
02:06:39.300 --> 02:06:42.210 line:15%
but even with my eyes closed, this is so great.

3565
02:06:43.244 --> 02:06:44.420 line:15%
You see it from 500 feet

3566
02:06:44.420 --> 02:06:47.182 line:15%
and there's just, they're closing in

3567
02:06:47.182 --> 02:06:48.394 line:15%
(laughing)

3568
02:06:48.394 --> 02:06:49.280 line:15%
on this little glass ball.

3569
02:06:50.814 --> 02:06:53.483 line:15%
This is the weirdest 28 Days Later reboot I've ever seen.

3570
02:06:53.483 --> 02:06:54.553 line:15%
(laughing)

3571
02:06:54.553 --> 02:06:55.614 line:15%
Lay out on the deck.

3572
02:06:55.614 --> 02:06:56.730 line:15%
(groaning)

3573
02:06:56.730 --> 02:06:57.580 line:15%
We'll say--
Namaste.

3574
02:06:57.580 --> 02:06:58.880 line:15%
Yeah.
And I lead them through

3575
02:06:58.880 --> 02:07:00.540 line:15%
a guided meditation.
You do.

3576
02:07:00.540 --> 02:07:02.000 line:15%
And you know what?

3577
02:07:02.000 --> 02:07:04.170 line:15%
Who here doesn't have a point of exhaustion?

3578
02:07:05.670 --> 02:07:07.310 line:15%
Doesn't?
Yasha does not, right?

3579
02:07:07.310 --> 02:07:08.143 line:15%
I do.
You do.

3580
02:07:08.143 --> 02:07:09.000 line:15%
All right.
I don't know

3581
02:07:10.043 --> 02:07:11.119 line:15%
where it came from, though.

3582
02:07:11.119 --> 02:07:12.580 line:15%
Caleb and Jester, it is a very nice guided meditation.

3583
02:07:12.580 --> 02:07:16.220 line:15%
It is weirdly calming for you, very challenging for you

3584
02:07:16.220 --> 02:07:18.000 line:15%
for the continuous amount of information

3585
02:07:18.000 --> 02:07:18.833 line:15%
that's going through your head,

3586
02:07:18.833 --> 02:07:21.210 line:15%
but you do find a few moments of clarity.

3587
02:07:21.210 --> 02:07:22.920 line:15%
You finish the meditation, you both

3588
02:07:22.920 --> 02:07:25.270 line:15%
open your eyes, and that was really peaceful.

3589
02:07:25.270 --> 02:07:26.645 line:15%
Everyone else is dead asleep.

3590
02:07:26.645 --> 02:07:28.240 line:15%
(laughing)

3591
02:07:28.240 --> 02:07:30.423 line:15%
I'm okay with that.
I'm all right with that.

3592
02:07:30.423 --> 02:07:31.980 line:15%
(sighs) Did your spirit animal come to you?

3593
02:07:31.980 --> 02:07:34.700 line:15%
Did you have a vision, did you?

3594
02:07:34.700 --> 02:07:35.533 line:15%
Who you talkin' to?

3595
02:07:35.533 --> 02:07:36.732 line:15%
We're all fuckin' out.

3596
02:07:36.732 --> 02:07:38.091 line:15%
I was talking to them.
Are you awake?

3597
02:07:38.091 --> 02:07:38.924 line:15%
Are you awake?
Well,

3598
02:07:38.924 --> 02:07:41.160 line:15%
I guided the meditation, so I'm assuming I am. (laughs)

3599
02:07:41.160 --> 02:07:42.510 line:15%
Yeah.
It's a marsh, I was out.

3600
02:07:42.510 --> 02:07:44.420 line:15%
Yeah.
Yeah. (laughs)

3601
02:07:44.420 --> 02:07:45.350 line:15%
Tickles.

3602
02:07:45.350 --> 02:07:47.720 line:15%
Because you know this space well, you weren't,

3603
02:07:47.720 --> 02:07:49.470 line:15%
you weren't taken by the meditation to put you to sleep.

3604
02:07:49.470 --> 02:07:50.792 line:15%
Sha-ka!

3605
02:07:50.792 --> 02:07:52.220 line:15%
(laughing)

3606
02:07:52.220 --> 02:07:53.483 line:15%
Nice cover.

3607
02:07:53.483 --> 02:07:55.280 line:15%
(laughing)

3608
02:07:55.280 --> 02:07:57.241 line:15%
What was that sound supposed to be?

3609
02:07:57.241 --> 02:07:59.090 line:15%
(laughs) Like how to tickle.

3610
02:07:59.090 --> 02:08:01.740 line:15%
The meditation, successful, was nice.

3611
02:08:01.740 --> 02:08:04.680 line:15%
Eventually, you find yourselves to a comfortable rest

3612
02:08:04.680 --> 02:08:06.440 line:15%
for the night within the safety of this dome,

3613
02:08:06.440 --> 02:08:09.180 line:15%
hopefully for the length of time that it remains

3614
02:08:09.180 --> 02:08:10.910 line:15%
as it is an eight hour dome and you spent the first

3615
02:08:10.910 --> 02:08:14.371 line:15%
two hours of it talking and going through this meditation.

3616
02:08:14.371 --> 02:08:16.040 line:15%
Oh Jesus.
But that should be fine.

3617
02:08:16.880 --> 02:08:18.470 line:15%
As you find yourselves asleep in

3618
02:08:18.470 --> 02:08:20.480 line:15%
the middle of the darkened mist-covered--

3619
02:08:20.480 --> 02:08:21.350 line:15%
Wait.
Swamp.

3620
02:08:21.350 --> 02:08:23.040 line:15%
One last thing.
Yes?

3621
02:08:23.040 --> 02:08:26.890 line:15%
As we're going to sleep, I just want to apologize, Caleb.

3622
02:08:28.134 --> 02:08:31.130 line:15%
I mean, I just want you to know that

3623
02:08:31.130 --> 02:08:33.590 line:15%
I would never use anything to modify a memory

3624
02:08:33.590 --> 02:08:36.190 line:15%
on you or Yasha or anyone that,

3625
02:08:39.767 --> 02:08:40.600 line:15%
that we know.

3626
02:08:40.600 --> 02:08:43.760 line:15%
You know, I know what it means.

3627
02:08:47.010 --> 02:08:47.843 line:15%
Well,

3628
02:08:52.452 --> 02:08:55.530 line:15%
it's a tricky thing and it's all about

3629
02:08:55.530 --> 02:08:57.460 line:15%
what you do with it, really.
Yeah.

3630
02:08:59.060 --> 02:09:01.630 line:15%
And you did a good thing.
Yeah.

3631
02:09:02.790 --> 02:09:05.490 line:15%
You made her happier.
I think so.

3632
02:09:05.490 --> 02:09:09.550 line:15%
And it sounds like you made your new friend

3633
02:09:09.550 --> 02:09:11.250 line:15%
happier as well.
(laughs) Yeah.

3634
02:09:14.203 --> 02:09:16.786 line:15%
(gentle music)

3635
02:09:18.210 --> 02:09:19.043 line:15%
Okay.

3636
02:09:20.096 --> 02:09:21.040 line:15%
I just wanted to make sure.

3637
02:09:24.820 --> 02:09:27.640 line:15%
Good night, Jester.
Good night, Caleb.

3638
02:09:27.640 --> 02:09:29.740 line:15%
(gentle music)

3639
02:09:29.740 --> 02:09:33.220 line:15%
Under the dull moonlight against the

3640
02:09:33.220 --> 02:09:36.430 line:15%
now relatively still marsh waters that rest around here,

3641
02:09:37.854 --> 02:09:39.910 line:15%
the darkened dome visible,

3642
02:09:41.520 --> 02:09:43.510 line:15%
you all find a night's rest.

3643
02:09:43.510 --> 02:09:44.891 line:15%
We're gonna go take a break.

3644
02:09:44.891 --> 02:09:45.823 line:15%
(whooping)

3645
02:09:45.823 --> 02:09:47.200 line:15%
Long rest, baby, you gimme dat.

3646
02:09:47.200 --> 02:09:48.730 line:15%
You did, you got yourself a long rest.

3647
02:09:48.730 --> 02:09:52.460 line:15%
I, I think, knocked over, there it is,

3648
02:09:52.460 --> 02:09:54.230 line:15%
my information sheet for the giveaway tonight.

3649
02:09:54.230 --> 02:09:56.660 line:15%
We have our giveaway tonight

3650
02:09:58.043 --> 02:10:00.930 line:15%
from our friends at Wyrmwood Gaming.

3651
02:10:00.930 --> 02:10:02.930
We're giving away the Valentine's Day Vault,

3652
02:10:02.930 --> 02:10:04.540
which includes a custom transcription,

3653
02:10:04.540 --> 02:10:07.000
transcwiption, in Quenya Elvish.

3654
02:10:08.589 --> 02:10:09.422
So we got, I guess, two of these

3655
02:10:09.422 --> 02:10:11.090
to give away on that, which is kinda rad.

3656
02:10:12.140 --> 02:10:13.830
You can order it now until February 8th,

3657
02:10:13.830 --> 02:10:16.580
so very soon, little window, at wyrmwoodgaming.com

3658
02:10:16.580 --> 02:10:18.670
to receive it by Valentine's Day if you're lookin' to

3659
02:10:18.670 --> 02:10:20.730
give one of these to a present and a special someone.

3660
02:10:20.730 --> 02:10:23.460
So, you got two days to get it in time.

3661
02:10:23.460 --> 02:10:24.600
So, the keyword.

3662
02:10:24.600 --> 02:10:26.760
Remember, you can only enter it once in chat.

3663
02:10:26.760 --> 02:10:28.970
Entering it more than once will disqualify you guys.

3664
02:10:30.084 --> 02:10:33.280
Once again, it's for US and Canada only, excluding Quebec

3665
02:10:33.280 --> 02:10:35.660
because of challenging laws.
Hey.

3666
02:10:37.058 --> 02:10:39.149
But yeah, the word tonight is cupcake.

3667
02:10:39.149 --> 02:10:41.256
(laughing)

3668
02:10:41.256 --> 02:10:44.020
There you go.
C-U-P-C-A-K-E, cupcake.

3669
02:10:44.020 --> 02:10:46.240
We'll be back here shortly to continue our story.

3670
02:10:46.240 --> 02:10:47.517

3712
02:13:33.915 --> 02:13:37.082
(bluesy guitar music)

3713
02:13:38.260 --> 02:13:40.700
Last time on Talks Machina.

3714
02:13:40.700 --> 02:13:43.510 line:15%
We saw your face journeys, but can you talk about

3715
02:13:43.510 --> 02:13:46.380 line:15%
your train of thought as Laura Bailey

3716
02:13:46.380 --> 02:13:50.070 line:15%
once again proved she is the bestest at haggling?

3717
02:13:50.070 --> 02:13:51.640 line:15%
It took awhile to realize what she doing,

3718
02:13:51.640 --> 02:13:53.680 line:15%
but then when we did, we were like, "There's no way"--

3719
02:13:53.680 --> 02:13:55.980 line:15%
I didn't, I genuinely didn't know what she was doing

3720
02:13:55.980 --> 02:13:58.060 line:15%
until the, so I was like, "Is this a bit?

3721
02:13:58.060 --> 02:13:59.940 line:15%
"Are you just doing a bit, is this?"

3722
02:13:59.940 --> 02:14:02.490 line:15%
Ah yeah, and then, that spell--

3723
02:14:02.490 --> 02:14:03.323 line:15%
Did you think she was

3724
02:14:03.323 --> 02:14:05.350 line:15%
gonna really give up her hands?

3725
02:14:05.350 --> 02:14:06.370 line:15%
I thought she was gonna give up her hands--

3726
02:14:06.370 --> 02:14:07.760
For a second, I was like--
I was like, "She must have

3727
02:14:07.760 --> 02:14:10.340
"some spell where she could grow them back?"

3728
02:14:10.340 --> 02:14:15.080
Jester does shit that you're like, "How did you even?

3729
02:14:15.080 --> 02:14:17.490
"You're so impulsive and you do thing."

3730
02:14:17.490 --> 02:14:19.840
Like, it wouldn't have surprised me if she did it.

3731
02:14:19.840 --> 02:14:21.890
It was so, it was so clutch, too.

3732
02:14:21.890 --> 02:14:23.860
It was so fucking crazy.
It was so cool.

3733
02:14:23.860 --> 02:14:25.990
She's playin' some long cons this campaign for sure.

3734
02:14:25.990 --> 02:14:26.870
Yes.
Yeah.

3735
02:14:27.950 --> 02:14:29.840
Every now and then you see somebody in one of these games

3736
02:14:29.840 --> 02:14:31.920
just do something so off the fucking wall.

3737
02:14:31.920 --> 02:14:33.350
And it was so off the fucking wall.

3738
02:14:33.350 --> 02:14:38.350
And she used Modify Memory in such a positive way,

3739
02:14:38.940 --> 02:14:42.020
which is what was so cool, it was just so delightful,

3740
02:14:42.020 --> 02:14:44.220
and then just, like, now the hag is like,

3741
02:14:44.220 --> 02:14:46.460
"Oh, I got a buddy now and I wonder where she is.

3742
02:14:46.460 --> 02:14:47.760
"I just wanna hang out with her."

3743
02:14:47.760 --> 02:14:48.593
I mean, who knows?

3744
02:14:48.593 --> 02:14:49.426
Maybe in the future, it won't--

3745
02:14:49.426 --> 02:14:51.086
That's gonna come back to haunt us.

3746
02:14:51.086 --> 02:14:52.072
It's gonna come back.
Yeah, 'cause Matt--

3747
02:14:52.072 --> 02:14:52.905
That's come back to haunt us.

3748
02:14:52.905 --> 02:14:54.530
Matt even did one of those, you know,

3749
02:14:54.530 --> 02:14:57.010
things where he says, "Yeah," but, you know,

3750
02:14:57.010 --> 02:14:59.630
and he's smiling while he does it that makes me think--

3751
02:14:59.630 --> 02:15:01.120
But in the moment.
"Oof."

3752
02:15:01.120 --> 02:15:03.420
But in the moment, yeah, it was incredible

3753
02:15:03.420 --> 02:15:05.690
to see that's what she chose to do

3754
02:15:05.690 --> 02:15:08.790
instead of, yeah, it was baffling.

3755
02:15:08.790 --> 02:15:10.250
Instead of--
Ugh, it was so good!

3756
02:15:10.250 --> 02:15:12.540
You do often see Modify Memory used

3757
02:15:12.540 --> 02:15:14.450
not that way and I thought that, yeah.

3758
02:15:14.450 --> 02:15:15.390
Yeah.
Yeah, yeah.

3759
02:15:15.390 --> 02:15:16.900
You're right, yeah.
It was so good

3760
02:15:16.900 --> 02:15:20.370
and the cupcake, it was just like, ah, it was so good.

3761
02:15:20.370 --> 02:15:22.770
It was a, perfect, it was perfect.

3762
02:15:22.770 --> 02:15:27.500 line:15%
As people went in and out of Isharnai's cabin, how'd I do?

3763
02:15:27.500 --> 02:15:29.810 line:15%
Good, right.
I'm awesome.

3764
02:15:29.810 --> 02:15:30.920 line:15%
You looked like you had a plan

3765
02:15:30.920 --> 02:15:32.110 line:15%
but you didn't get to act on it.

3766
02:15:32.110 --> 02:15:35.920 line:15%
The best I came up with, I came up with the idea of

3767
02:15:37.170 --> 02:15:42.170
Clay was thinking of offering to never go home again.

3768
02:15:42.360 --> 02:15:43.950
Oh.

3769
02:15:43.950 --> 02:15:44.970
Whoa.

3770
02:15:44.970 --> 02:15:47.020
So, still save everything.

3771
02:15:47.020 --> 02:15:48.250
Yeah, but just never see it.

3772
02:15:48.250 --> 02:15:50.460
But just be like, "I agree to never,

3773
02:15:51.855 --> 02:15:54.330
"that once it's up, it's fine."

3774
02:15:54.330 --> 02:15:57.270
That's rough.
That's rough, buddy.

3775
02:15:57.270 --> 02:16:01.090
Didn't have to do it, so.
Goddamn.

3776
02:16:01.090 --> 02:16:03.860 line:15%
How did it feel for Yasha to be told

3777
02:16:03.860 --> 02:16:07.210 line:15%
she was already too miserable to make a bargain with?

3778
02:16:07.210 --> 02:16:09.740 line:15%
Does Yasha agree that she is the bottom of the barrel

3779
02:16:09.740 --> 02:16:12.270 line:15%
or has she found some happiness with her friends?

3780
02:16:12.270 --> 02:16:14.540 line:15%
I think she would agree with that

3781
02:16:16.875 --> 02:16:19.370 line:15%
and I think it was almost good for her to hear that,

3782
02:16:19.370 --> 02:16:22.420 line:15%
of like, "You're the bottom of the barrel right now."

3783
02:16:24.536 --> 02:16:27.240 line:15%
(inhales) I do think she's slowly

3784
02:16:27.240 --> 02:16:31.370
finding happiness with her friends

3785
02:16:31.370 --> 02:16:32.790
and sort of getting comfortable

3786
02:16:32.790 --> 02:16:34.480
with those relationships again.

3787
02:16:34.480 --> 02:16:38.210
I think sort of the conversation with Caleb sort of

3788
02:16:39.810 --> 02:16:41.080
was nice to, I mean,

3789
02:16:43.520 --> 02:16:44.450
to sort of have

3790
02:16:46.693 --> 02:16:47.860
a companion in

3791
02:16:49.470 --> 02:16:50.340 line:15%
misery.

3792
02:16:50.340 --> 02:16:52.090 line:15%
When communing with the Wildmother,

3793
02:16:52.090 --> 02:16:53.770 line:15%
Caduceus received confirmation that

3794
02:16:53.770 --> 02:16:56.370 line:15%
his family indeed is at the menagerie.

3795
02:16:56.370 --> 02:17:00.400 line:15%
However, Matt described this response having less intensity.

3796
02:17:00.400 --> 02:17:02.220 line:15%
How did Caduceus interpret this?

3797
02:17:02.220 --> 02:17:05.010 line:15%
Not all of them are there.
Okay.

3798
02:17:05.010 --> 02:17:06.250 line:15%
Just--
That was his immediate

3799
02:17:06.250 --> 02:17:09.020 line:15%
thought is it's just one or two of them, not everybody.

3800
02:17:11.050 --> 02:17:12.210 line:15%
Probably one, but.

3801
02:17:14.410 --> 02:17:17.160 line:15%
But that was how I interpreted it, anyway.

3802
02:17:17.160 --> 02:17:19.800 line:15%
And how did he feel about this news?

3803
02:17:21.850 --> 02:17:24.550 line:15%
Relieved and also embarrassed that he bothered to ask.

3804
02:17:24.550 --> 02:17:26.080 line:15%
It was one of those things where you shouldn't ask,

3805
02:17:26.080 --> 02:17:27.845 line:15%
this is not the sort of thing you ask,

3806
02:17:27.845 --> 02:17:31.150 line:15%
that's a sign of cowardice.

3807
02:17:31.150 --> 02:17:32.950 line:15%
Yasha made up her mind very quickly

3808
02:17:32.950 --> 02:17:35.070 line:15%
to enter the hag's home to make a deal.

3809
02:17:35.070 --> 02:17:37.500 line:15%
What was her thought process while listening to

3810
02:17:37.500 --> 02:17:41.070 line:15%
Beau speak about the deal she wanted to make?

3811
02:17:41.070 --> 02:17:43.570
I didn't necessarily see it as one-upping each other,

3812
02:17:43.570 --> 02:17:46.030
but I get that, but I think all of us were like,

3813
02:17:46.030 --> 02:17:47.820
"No, I'm not gonna let you do that.

3814
02:17:47.820 --> 02:17:50.850
"I can give up something, you can't,

3815
02:17:50.850 --> 02:17:53.390
"but I can because you're more important."

3816
02:17:55.100 --> 02:17:58.247
But I think it was just sort of,

3817
02:17:58.247 --> 02:17:59.164
(barking)

3818
02:17:59.164 --> 02:18:00.780
oh!
It's Marisha!

3819
02:18:00.780 --> 02:18:04.780
Speaking of!
He's excited to see Marisha.

3820
02:18:04.780 --> 02:18:06.503
I was going to--
It was a slow walk.

3821
02:18:06.503 --> 02:18:08.050
Stealthily.
You can't

3822
02:18:08.050 --> 02:18:10.810
sneak out stealthily from that dog.

3823
02:18:10.810 --> 02:18:12.290
You rolled low on that stealth.

3824
02:18:12.290 --> 02:18:14.220
Yeah, that was a natural one.

3825
02:18:14.220 --> 02:18:15.240 line:15%
A natural one.

3826
02:18:15.240 --> 02:18:18.120 line:15%
What do you make of Jester leaning into

3827
02:18:18.120 --> 02:18:21.850 line:15%
the more serious side of the Trickery domain as this was

3828
02:18:21.850 --> 02:18:26.320 line:15%
a masterful display of subterfuge against a powerful being

3829
02:18:26.320 --> 02:18:28.950 line:15%
rather than just one of her innocent pranks?

3830
02:18:28.950 --> 02:18:30.550 line:15%
I feel like the innocent pranks are already

3831
02:18:30.550 --> 02:18:32.560 line:15%
covering for the masterful subterfuge.

3832
02:18:32.560 --> 02:18:34.760 line:15%
I think it's all a grand scheme, personally.

3833
02:18:34.760 --> 02:18:38.020 line:15%
Yeah, I feel like, I mean, we don't

3834
02:18:38.020 --> 02:18:40.500 line:15%
fully know what happened in there yet.

3835
02:18:40.500 --> 02:18:42.270 line:15%
No, we actually, the characters have no--

3836
02:18:42.270 --> 02:18:43.103 line:15%
The characters don't.

3837
02:18:43.103 --> 02:18:44.730 line:15%
She literally just, she just ran outta there

3838
02:18:44.730 --> 02:18:46.780 line:15%
like somebody running out of 7-11

3839
02:18:46.780 --> 02:18:47.890 line:15%
going, "Don't ask questions."

3840
02:18:47.890 --> 02:18:48.740 line:15%
Start the car.
Start the car,

3841
02:18:48.740 --> 02:18:50.220 line:15%
let's go, we're going right now, right now.

3842
02:18:50.220 --> 02:18:52.457 line:15%
Don't ask.
No, we're not leaving.

3843
02:18:52.457 --> 02:18:53.290
Don't look back.
No,

3844
02:18:53.290 --> 02:18:54.498
we're not leaving him, no.

3845
02:18:54.498 --> 02:18:55.705
Oh Henry.
Henry.

3846
02:18:55.705 --> 02:18:57.428
Henry?
He's, I feel like--

3847
02:18:57.428 --> 02:18:58.261
Don't go over there, that's something special.

3848
02:18:58.261 --> 02:18:59.930
There's a cop hiding somewhere in here.

3849
02:18:59.930 --> 02:19:01.420
He's been tryna sniff him out for me.

3850
02:19:01.420 --> 02:19:02.290
I trained him to sniff out cops.

3851
02:19:02.290 --> 02:19:03.980
There's a cop hiding in all of us.

3852
02:19:03.980 --> 02:19:04.813
Sit.
Truly,

3853
02:19:04.813 --> 02:19:05.990
when you think about it.
That's true.

3854
02:19:05.990 --> 02:19:07.096
Sit, thank you.
The Cop Inside Me?

3855
02:19:07.096 --> 02:19:10.020
I read that book, changed my life.

3856
02:19:11.066 --> 02:19:13.816
(dramatic music)

3857
02:19:16.141 --> 02:19:16.974
(cheering)

3858
02:19:16.974 --> 02:19:18.240
(whooping)

3859
02:19:18.240 --> 02:19:21.490
Yeah, we did it, yeah!
Sam Riegel,

3860
02:19:21.490 --> 02:19:23.640 line:15%
you just won the Super Bowl, what're you gonna do now?

3861
02:19:23.640 --> 02:19:26.770 line:15%
I'm subscribin' to Critical Role, yeah!

3862
02:19:26.770 --> 02:19:29.440
Beautiful, and that's--
It's about perseverance,

3863
02:19:29.440 --> 02:19:31.070
like remembering to resubscribe

3864
02:19:31.070 --> 02:19:33.290
with Twitch Prime every month,

3865
02:19:33.290 --> 02:19:34.490
yeah, ho ho ho ho.
Yes!

3866
02:19:34.490 --> 02:19:35.323
Well, could you--
Have done it

3867
02:19:35.323 --> 02:19:36.280
without my teammates?

3868
02:19:36.280 --> 02:19:37.270
Come on, no way!

3869
02:19:38.115 --> 02:19:39.300
And they couldn't have done it without the

3870
02:19:39.300 --> 02:19:42.490
Twitch subscriptions that I gave them, right guys?

3871
02:19:42.490 --> 02:19:45.002
Yeah.
Okay, Sam, but what about--

3872
02:19:45.002 --> 02:19:47.730
What about what inspires me, you mean?

3873
02:19:47.730 --> 02:19:49.770
Well, Yee-Haw Game Ranch really does.

3874
02:19:49.770 --> 02:19:53.080 line:15%
I mean, watchin' that dehydrated piece of string cheese

3875
02:19:53.080 --> 02:19:55.310 line:15%
Brian Foster every couple weeks

3876
02:19:55.310 --> 02:19:57.690 line:15%
really gets me pumped for the big game. (laughs)

3877
02:19:57.690 --> 02:19:59.757
Sam, hold on, we have to--

3878
02:19:59.757 --> 02:20:00.654
(air horn blowing)

3879
02:20:00.654 --> 02:20:01.487
You can't believe it?

3880
02:20:01.487 --> 02:20:02.750
You can't believe it, is that what you said?

3881
02:20:02.750 --> 02:20:05.430
Well, it's true because every Yee-Haw VOD

3882
02:20:05.430 --> 02:20:07.660
is instantly available as soon as

3883
02:20:07.660 --> 02:20:09.640
you subscribe, it's amazing.

3884
02:20:09.640 --> 02:20:10.870
Sam!
We did it, guys.

3885
02:20:10.870 --> 02:20:12.610
Sam!
Yeah, yeah!

3886
02:20:12.610 --> 02:20:13.443
Sam!
Yeah!

3887
02:20:13.443 --> 02:20:14.650
What? Sorry.
Just say,

3888
02:20:14.650 --> 02:20:16.120
"I'm going to Disneyland."

3889
02:20:16.120 --> 02:20:18.230
You're doing a commercial for Disneyland.

3890
02:20:18.230 --> 02:20:19.063
Oh.

3891
02:20:20.020 --> 02:20:21.601
Uh.

3892
02:20:21.601 --> 02:20:22.930
(squirting)

3893
02:20:22.930 --> 02:20:24.358
What's a Disneyland?

3894
02:20:24.358 --> 02:20:26.555 line:15%
(exploding)
(dramatic music)

3895
02:20:26.555 --> 02:20:28.407 line:15%
(whistle blowing)

3896
02:20:28.407 --> 02:20:30.840 line:15%
(dramatic music)

3897
02:20:30.840 --> 02:20:32.620
I don't know, I gotta be honest with you--

3898
02:20:32.620 --> 02:20:34.850
Oh!
I got hit in the head

3899
02:20:34.850 --> 02:20:37.180
pretty hard out there.
Oh my god.

3900
02:20:37.180 --> 02:20:40.211
Whoo, uh, I'm not good at sports.

3901
02:20:40.211 --> 02:20:42.725
(thudding)
(crowd groaning)

3902
02:20:42.725 --> 02:20:43.891
(whooshing)

3903
02:20:43.891 --> 02:20:46.055
(cheering)

3904
02:20:46.055 --> 02:20:48.805
(fire whooshing)

3905
02:20:50.138 --> 02:20:52.888 line:15%
(dramatic music)

3906
02:34:32.702 --> 02:34:33.535
And welcome back.

3907
02:34:33.535 --> 02:34:35.420
Alrighty, so we have our two winners

3908
02:34:35.420 --> 02:34:38.230
for the two pieces in our Wyrmwood giveaway

3909
02:34:38.230 --> 02:34:41.330
of these Valentine's Day inscripted bits.

3910
02:34:41.330 --> 02:34:45.120
The winners are thintheveil.
Ooh.

3911
02:34:45.120 --> 02:34:47.100
Congratulations, thintheveil.

3912
02:34:47.100 --> 02:34:49.700
And gamerjasmania.
Ooh.

3913
02:34:50.771 --> 02:34:52.890
Congratulations to the both of you.

3914
02:34:52.890 --> 02:34:55.544
We'll get those pieces sent out to you ASAP.

3915
02:34:55.544 --> 02:34:56.760
(paper rustling)

3916
02:34:56.760 --> 02:34:58.160
Alrighty.
Wow.

3917
02:34:59.560 --> 02:35:04.560 line:15%
So, Mighty Nein, after a long rest is acquired,

3918
02:35:05.580 --> 02:35:07.570 line:15%
the points of exhaustion of which those of you who

3919
02:35:07.570 --> 02:35:10.710 line:15%
still maintain them, if you had just one, goes away.

3920
02:35:10.710 --> 02:35:13.540 line:15%
I believe you all just have one point each.

3921
02:35:13.540 --> 02:35:17.410 line:15%
But you awaken just as the dome itself vanishes.

3922
02:35:17.410 --> 02:35:19.890 line:15%
You're awakened because as soon as it does,

3923
02:35:19.890 --> 02:35:24.890 line:15%
the warm, comfortable interior and the not-as-terrible smell

3924
02:35:25.860 --> 02:35:28.240 line:15%
suddenly vanishes and you find yourself

3925
02:35:28.240 --> 02:35:30.470 line:15%
immediately exposed to the elements of the swamp

3926
02:35:30.470 --> 02:35:32.450 line:15%
and (gasps) you all kind of wake up as

3927
02:35:32.450 --> 02:35:35.190 line:15%
the cold air and the mist, still burning off

3928
02:35:35.190 --> 02:35:38.520 line:15%
in the early morning around you, greets you to the day.

3929
02:35:39.565 --> 02:35:40.660 line:15%
(groaning)

3930
02:35:40.660 --> 02:35:42.000 line:15%
Early to bed--
Detect Undead.

3931
02:35:42.000 --> 02:35:43.370 line:15%
Early to rise.
Okay.

3932
02:35:46.013 --> 02:35:47.662 line:15%
None.

3933
02:35:47.662 --> 02:35:48.662 line:15%
Oh.
We're good.

3934
02:35:50.359 --> 02:35:51.300 line:15%
For the time being, anyway.

3935
02:35:51.300 --> 02:35:52.133 line:15%
Pa-pa-pa-pow.

3936
02:35:53.009 --> 02:35:54.944 line:15%
(laughing)

3937
02:35:54.944 --> 02:35:57.150 line:15%
We should get out of here.
We should get out of here.

3938
02:35:57.150 --> 02:35:58.000 line:15%
Caleb?
Yeah?

3939
02:35:58.841 --> 02:35:59.810 line:15%
I'm beginning my spells.

3940
02:35:59.810 --> 02:36:02.990 line:15%
Can you teleport us out or do I need to find a path?

3941
02:36:02.990 --> 02:36:05.990 line:15%
I think so but I don't know that I can draw

3942
02:36:05.990 --> 02:36:08.620 line:15%
upon the ground here.
You're right.

3943
02:36:10.200 --> 02:36:12.120 line:15%
Maybe finding the path.
So we may need to walk

3944
02:36:12.120 --> 02:36:12.953 line:15%
a little bit.
Hold on.

3945
02:36:12.953 --> 02:36:15.300 line:15%
Lemme see, hold on.
Wait, you could--

3946
02:36:15.300 --> 02:36:19.960 line:15%
A shape--
You could paint a ground.

3947
02:36:19.960 --> 02:36:22.460 line:15%
I could paint a ground on the shitty ground?

3948
02:36:22.460 --> 02:36:24.661 line:15%
You could paint--
Hold on, hold on, hold on.

3949
02:36:24.661 --> 02:36:26.670 line:15%
A breakdancing cardboard piece.

3950
02:36:28.691 --> 02:36:29.971 line:15%
You know what I mean?
I do.

3951
02:36:29.971 --> 02:36:33.179 line:15%
How much space do you need to make the circle?

3952
02:36:33.179 --> 02:36:35.780 line:15%
A 10 foot diameter circle.
Big breakdance.

3953
02:36:36.850 --> 02:36:39.920 line:15%
Well, I could Stone Shape a couple times.

3954
02:36:39.920 --> 02:36:42.940 line:15%
Or we could just walk.
Or we just walk out.

3955
02:36:44.377 --> 02:36:45.210 line:15%
We walked in.

3956
02:36:47.590 --> 02:36:52.590 line:15%
Maybe we walk until we get to ground that you can draw on.

3957
02:36:52.680 --> 02:36:54.960 line:15%
Where do we want to go, again?

3958
02:36:54.960 --> 02:36:56.150 line:15%
I don't know.
I guess

3959
02:36:56.150 --> 02:36:57.650 line:15%
back the way we came?
Yeah.

3960
02:36:58.549 --> 02:37:00.667 line:15%
Do you think our horses are still alive?

3961
02:37:00.667 --> 02:37:01.500 line:15%
(gasping)

3962
02:37:01.500 --> 02:37:03.130 line:15%
How do you think WCG there is doing?

3963
02:37:03.130 --> 02:37:04.360 line:15%
No, we sent them home, remember?

3964
02:37:04.360 --> 02:37:06.588 line:15%
I know, but do you think they made it?

3965
02:37:06.588 --> 02:37:08.127 line:15%
No.
No, me neither.

3966
02:37:08.127 --> 02:37:09.962 line:15%
(laughing)

3967
02:37:09.962 --> 02:37:11.494 line:15%
Not a fuckin' chance.

3968
02:37:11.494 --> 02:37:12.841 line:15%
(chuckling)

3969
02:37:12.841 --> 02:37:16.600 line:15%
Oh, I'll just stay under this tree at night. (growls)

3970
02:37:16.600 --> 02:37:17.433 line:15%
(laughing)

3971
02:37:17.433 --> 02:37:19.340 line:15%
Well, they were disguised as moorbounders

3972
02:37:19.340 --> 02:37:21.290 line:15%
dancing around like horses.
Oh yes, that's true.

3973
02:37:21.290 --> 02:37:22.190 line:15%
Yup.
For how long?

3974
02:37:22.190 --> 02:37:24.052 line:15%
An hour or something.

3975
02:37:24.052 --> 02:37:24.892 line:15%
(laughing)

3976
02:37:24.892 --> 02:37:26.192 line:15%
No, it was eight hours.
Eight hours.

3977
02:37:26.192 --> 02:37:27.306 line:15%
Eight hours?
Yep.

3978
02:37:27.306 --> 02:37:28.480 line:15%
Concentrate?
Seeming lasts awhile.

3979
02:37:28.480 --> 02:37:30.200 line:15%
No, not concentration.
We could head that way

3980
02:37:30.200 --> 02:37:32.260 line:15%
and see if there's anything left. (laughs)

3981
02:37:32.260 --> 02:37:34.670 line:15%
Summons a scrap.
They were--

3982
02:37:34.670 --> 02:37:36.210 line:15%
Or they got killed when they got into town

3983
02:37:36.210 --> 02:37:37.627 line:15%
'cause they were like, "Ahh!"

3984
02:37:37.627 --> 02:37:39.140 line:15%
(laughing)

3985
02:37:39.140 --> 02:37:41.184 line:15%
They made it all the way back.

3986
02:37:41.184 --> 02:37:42.017 line:15%
(laughing)

3987
02:37:42.017 --> 02:37:43.260 line:15%
Hey!
B-listers!

3988
02:37:43.260 --> 02:37:44.214 line:15%
Oh no!

3989
02:37:44.214 --> 02:37:45.047 line:15%
(laughing)

3990
02:37:45.047 --> 02:37:46.200 line:15%
That is so true.
Slay the beasts!

3991
02:37:46.200 --> 02:37:47.972 line:15%
Also, fair.

3992
02:37:47.972 --> 02:37:49.049 line:15%
(laughing)

3993
02:37:49.049 --> 02:37:49.976 line:15%
Buttercup?

3994
02:37:49.976 --> 02:37:51.190 line:15%
(laughing)

3995
02:37:51.190 --> 02:37:52.857 line:15%
Oh no.
It's okay.

3996
02:37:54.007 --> 02:37:55.296 line:15%
All right, let's move, take advantage

3997
02:37:55.296 --> 02:37:56.292 line:15%
of the light.
They're used

3998
02:37:56.292 --> 02:37:58.493 line:15%
to the wild, they'll be fine.

3999
02:37:58.493 --> 02:37:59.720 line:15%
Do we have to move quietly?

4000
02:37:59.720 --> 02:38:02.730 line:15%
Or just go as fast as we fucking can?

4001
02:38:02.730 --> 02:38:05.230 line:15%
Kinda want that to be the reality.

4002
02:38:05.230 --> 02:38:06.654 line:15%
(laughing)

4003
02:38:06.654 --> 02:38:07.810 line:15%
Just 'cause it's so funny.

4004
02:38:07.810 --> 02:38:12.550 line:15%
Are we casting your path locating spell or just takin' it?

4005
02:38:12.550 --> 02:38:15.460 line:15%
I mean, I guess I can prepare it.

4006
02:38:15.460 --> 02:38:17.030 line:15%
Give me a second.

4007
02:38:17.030 --> 02:38:18.230 line:15%
If you continue to traverse here,

4008
02:38:18.230 --> 02:38:20.260 line:15%
we will begin doing a skill challenge.

4009
02:38:21.210 --> 02:38:22.690 line:15%
Oh, that's right.
If you're heading,

4010
02:38:22.690 --> 02:38:23.880 line:15%
if you're walking the rest of this path--

4011
02:38:23.880 --> 02:38:25.370 line:15%
That's why I was saying we should teleport.

4012
02:38:25.370 --> 02:38:27.680 line:15%
We certainly can't draw it.
It's up to you.

4013
02:38:27.680 --> 02:38:30.320 line:15%
Find the Path will help reduce the number

4014
02:38:30.320 --> 02:38:32.360 line:15%
of successes required to make your way out.

4015
02:38:32.360 --> 02:38:33.440 line:15%
We are done with your family?

4016
02:38:33.440 --> 02:38:34.870 line:15%
You don't need, that's it

4017
02:38:34.870 --> 02:38:36.400 line:15%
for now?
Yep.

4018
02:38:36.400 --> 02:38:37.900 line:15%
You don't need to go back?

4019
02:38:37.900 --> 02:38:40.700 line:15%
For, I have no answers.
To kidnap your brother?

4020
02:38:40.700 --> 02:38:43.210 line:15%
Not, and I can't, not yet, I don't think.

4021
02:38:43.210 --> 02:38:47.493 line:15%
I have nothing else to report, I don't think.

4022
02:38:48.474 --> 02:38:49.750 line:15%
(throat clearing)

4023
02:38:49.750 --> 02:38:52.710 line:15%
Okay, it's done.
Nothin' I can't send in

4024
02:38:52.710 --> 02:38:55.060 line:15%
a message through Jes.
I can send a message.

4025
02:38:57.010 --> 02:38:58.190 line:15%
She was gesturing to you, so--

4026
02:38:58.190 --> 02:38:59.023 line:15%
Yeah.
Yeah.

4027
02:39:00.320 --> 02:39:02.020 line:15%
Well--
By the way--

4028
02:39:02.020 --> 02:39:03.810 line:15%
Then yeah, I could send a message.

4029
02:39:03.810 --> 02:39:08.290 line:15%
That meditation stuff, I mean, it felt a lot like sleep.

4030
02:39:08.290 --> 02:39:09.897 line:15%
Yeah, you fell asleep.

4031
02:39:09.897 --> 02:39:12.160 line:15%
(laughing)

4032
02:39:12.160 --> 02:39:13.420 line:15%
I didn't, I stayed awake.

4033
02:39:13.420 --> 02:39:15.040 line:15%
We'll try again when we're--
No, you fell asleep.

4034
02:39:15.040 --> 02:39:17.580 line:15%
Not so tapped.
Okay.

4035
02:39:17.580 --> 02:39:21.330 line:15%
Yeah.
Maybe for the time being,

4036
02:39:21.330 --> 02:39:22.830 line:15%
you just practice being sober.

4037
02:39:25.510 --> 02:39:27.010 line:15%
Okay.
How has that been?

4038
02:39:28.150 --> 02:39:30.290 line:15%
'Cause I know you were kinda doin' all right

4039
02:39:30.290 --> 02:39:33.310 line:15%
and then, but I don't know if that's how--

4040
02:39:33.310 --> 02:39:34.550 line:15%
I've been sneaking a lot of--

4041
02:39:34.550 --> 02:39:36.310 line:15%
No, I--
Booze.

4042
02:39:36.310 --> 02:39:38.990 line:15%
We've noticed.
Okay, okay.

4043
02:39:38.990 --> 02:39:40.190 line:15%
I mean--
No, we know.

4044
02:39:41.436 --> 02:39:42.867 line:15%
Cool, I mean--
Yeah.

4045
02:39:42.867 --> 02:39:43.700 line:15%
It's been going great, then.

4046
02:39:44.601 --> 02:39:45.434 line:15%
(laughing)

4047
02:39:45.434 --> 02:39:46.710 line:15%
Mmhm.
We can often tell

4048
02:39:46.710 --> 02:39:48.260 line:15%
because you get a little aggro.

4049
02:39:49.780 --> 02:39:51.500 line:15%
What the fuck did you just say?

4050
02:39:51.500 --> 02:39:52.591 line:15%
I'm just kidding.

4051
02:39:52.591 --> 02:39:54.551 line:15%
(laughing)

4052
02:39:54.551 --> 02:39:57.320 line:15%
Is it something you want us to help remind you with or no?

4053
02:39:57.320 --> 02:39:58.920 line:15%
No, I like to drink.
Right.

4054
02:40:00.223 --> 02:40:02.150 line:15%
Do you want us to help you with that?

4055
02:40:02.150 --> 02:40:04.220 line:15%
But if I'm aiming for this meditation thing,

4056
02:40:04.220 --> 02:40:07.580 line:15%
then I will do my best, so yes, if you catch me

4057
02:40:07.580 --> 02:40:09.570 line:15%
taking a little nip, why don't,

4058
02:40:09.570 --> 02:40:13.030 line:15%
Yasha, why don't you knock it outta my hand?

4059
02:40:14.740 --> 02:40:16.970 line:15%
Are you sure?
Yup.

4060
02:40:16.970 --> 02:40:19.600 line:15%
Yasha's the only one with permission?

4061
02:40:19.600 --> 02:40:21.290 line:15%
Yeah, yeah.
What if

4062
02:40:21.290 --> 02:40:23.820 line:15%
she doesn't notice and the rest of us do?

4063
02:40:23.820 --> 02:40:26.060 line:15%
Are we allowed to--
You can tell Yasha.

4064
02:40:26.060 --> 02:40:26.893 line:15%
Tell her?
Oh.

4065
02:40:26.893 --> 02:40:30.510 line:15%
Are you stopping entirely or is there, are you

4066
02:40:30.510 --> 02:40:32.156 line:15%
doing a taper thing?
No, don't ask for

4067
02:40:32.156 --> 02:40:33.190 line:15%
clarification, wider is better.

4068
02:40:33.190 --> 02:40:35.540 line:15%
Broad, broad.
Any time

4069
02:40:35.540 --> 02:40:37.320 line:15%
you take a nip, I knock it out of your hand?

4070
02:40:37.320 --> 02:40:39.390 line:15%
Go ahead, I give you permission.

4071
02:40:39.390 --> 02:40:42.400 line:15%
What about if we go to a tavern or something and you want

4072
02:40:42.400 --> 02:40:43.650 line:15%
something to drink?
Nope, nope.

4073
02:40:43.650 --> 02:40:44.483 line:15%
Knock it out.
Wait,

4074
02:40:44.483 --> 02:40:47.220 line:15%
this counts at taverns, too?
Anywhere.

4075
02:40:48.217 --> 02:40:49.540 line:15%
Oh shit.
Booze is booze is booze.

4076
02:40:49.540 --> 02:40:51.360 line:15%
All right.
But

4077
02:40:51.360 --> 02:40:53.360 line:15%
a lot of taverns have decent milk.

4078
02:40:54.510 --> 02:40:57.470 line:15%
I've seen the lumpy shit that you drink.

4079
02:40:57.470 --> 02:41:00.430 line:15%
It's like stew, it's like dairy stew.

4080
02:41:00.430 --> 02:41:02.580 line:15%
I have a lot of--
You could have some tea.

4081
02:41:02.580 --> 02:41:06.240 line:15%
I also have some dust of deliciousness left.

4082
02:41:06.240 --> 02:41:10.430 line:15%
Okay, so you can make the curdled milk taste

4083
02:41:10.430 --> 02:41:12.680 line:15%
like a cupcake?
Yeah.

4084
02:41:12.680 --> 02:41:14.280 line:15%
Like butter.
All right. (laughs)

4085
02:41:14.280 --> 02:41:16.061 line:15%
New England clam chowder.

4086
02:41:16.061 --> 02:41:17.948 line:15%
(groaning)
(gagging)

4087
02:41:17.948 --> 02:41:18.781 line:15%
All right.

4088
02:41:18.781 --> 02:41:20.441 line:15%
(laughing)

4089
02:41:20.441 --> 02:41:23.790 line:15%
A nice of shot of New England clam chowder.

4090
02:41:24.692 --> 02:41:26.840 line:15%
(gagging)

4091
02:41:26.840 --> 02:41:29.210 line:15%
With tequila.
Oh no--

4092
02:41:29.210 --> 02:41:32.001 line:15%
Beer and ranch dressing.
That sounds good.

4093
02:41:32.001 --> 02:41:33.400 line:15%
(laughing)

4094
02:41:33.400 --> 02:41:35.500 line:15%
You saved yourself and you saved us all.

4095
02:41:37.455 --> 02:41:38.288 line:15%
So what's the plan?

4096
02:41:38.288 --> 02:41:40.050 line:15%
Are you guys traversing the way back?

4097
02:41:40.050 --> 02:41:42.630 line:15%
No, I am going to use Stone Shape.

4098
02:41:44.881 --> 02:41:45.840 line:15%
Okay.
And I'm going to look for

4099
02:41:45.840 --> 02:41:50.360 line:15%
a patch of ground that is, you know, good

4100
02:41:50.360 --> 02:41:53.410 line:15%
and I'm gonna make it nice and flat and, like,

4101
02:41:54.280 --> 02:41:56.510 line:15%
drawable for Caleb.
Okay.

4102
02:41:56.510 --> 02:41:58.380 line:15%
Yeah, you can definitely do that with that spell.

4103
02:41:58.380 --> 02:41:59.440 line:15%
So, you take a little bitta time,

4104
02:41:59.440 --> 02:42:02.080 line:15%
keeping an eye out as well, setting up

4105
02:42:02.080 --> 02:42:05.020 line:15%
this kind of stone flatland platform

4106
02:42:05.020 --> 02:42:09.190 line:15%
large enough to contain this circle of teleportation.

4107
02:42:10.600 --> 02:42:11.590 line:15%
Easily enough, it's available to you.

4108
02:42:11.590 --> 02:42:14.690 line:15%
You can begin the inscribing on the ground.

4109
02:42:14.690 --> 02:42:15.740 line:15%
Destination?
Oh.

4110
02:42:17.570 --> 02:42:20.840 line:15%
Anywhere, East or West?
Where do you wanna go?

4111
02:42:20.840 --> 02:42:22.650 line:15%
I don't care.
The menagerie.

4112
02:42:22.650 --> 02:42:25.010 line:15%
Close to the menagerie.

4113
02:42:25.010 --> 02:42:27.970 line:15%
Well, we can go to Yussa's.
Mm hm.

4114
02:42:28.881 --> 02:42:30.200 line:15%
Do you want to give him a heads up this time?

4115
02:42:30.200 --> 02:42:32.380 line:15%
We could actually be responsible, for once.

4116
02:42:32.380 --> 02:42:34.330 line:15%
Is that, weren't we going to--

4117
02:42:36.340 --> 02:42:38.080 line:15%
Caduceus.
To Caduceus'--

4118
02:42:38.080 --> 02:42:40.670 line:15%
That would be on the way, that would be the way to do it.

4119
02:42:40.670 --> 02:42:42.570 line:15%
On the way, well, I mean--
Well--

4120
02:42:42.570 --> 02:42:45.100 line:15%
We're over here.
But I don't know if--

4121
02:42:45.100 --> 02:42:47.450 line:15%
Menagerie is here and Yussa's over here, so--

4122
02:42:47.450 --> 02:42:49.540 line:15%
But what he's saying I don't know if Caleb

4123
02:42:49.540 --> 02:42:52.460 line:15%
knows any other closer teleportation circles--

4124
02:42:52.460 --> 02:42:53.293 line:15%
I don't know.
Past that.

4125
02:42:53.293 --> 02:42:58.280 line:15%
But we can go to Rosohna and ask Essek to take us there

4126
02:42:58.280 --> 02:43:02.750 line:15%
Or we can get the ship.
And go to your place

4127
02:43:02.750 --> 02:43:04.690 line:15%
and then go do the meetup.
And go to my place and then

4128
02:43:04.690 --> 02:43:05.523 line:15%
to yours.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

4129
02:43:05.523 --> 02:43:07.450 line:15%
That's a lot of seafaring.
Yeah.

4130
02:43:07.450 --> 02:43:09.280 line:15%
That's three weeks of seafaring.

4131
02:43:09.280 --> 02:43:11.207 line:15%
Awesome.
That sounds great.

4132
02:43:11.207 --> 02:43:12.565 line:15%
We haven't been on a boat in a long time, you guys.

4133
02:43:12.565 --> 02:43:13.630 line:15%
We're just gonna go on a sail for three weeks?

4134
02:43:13.630 --> 02:43:14.600 line:15%
Yeah.
Don't we have shit to do?

4135
02:43:14.600 --> 02:43:15.510 line:15%
Don't you wanna--
Wait, but isn't

4136
02:43:15.510 --> 02:43:17.640 line:15%
the con coming up--
I'm going to

4137
02:43:17.640 --> 02:43:20.310 line:15%
send a message to Orly and see where they are.

4138
02:43:20.310 --> 02:43:22.020 line:15%
You're right, but we'd be going down there.

4139
02:43:22.020 --> 02:43:23.520 line:15%
Okay.
We'd be going down there

4140
02:43:23.520 --> 02:43:24.353 line:15%
anyway.
I still think--

4141
02:43:24.353 --> 02:43:25.440 line:15%
We did tell Orly to stay, right?

4142
02:43:25.440 --> 02:43:27.240 line:15%
We did.
You told Orly to

4143
02:43:27.240 --> 02:43:29.187 line:15%
hang around, I believe.
Hey Orly, don't go

4144
02:43:29.187 --> 02:43:30.980 line:15%
Stay.
We did?

4145
02:43:30.980 --> 02:43:31.900 line:15%
Mmhm.
I think so.

4146
02:43:31.900 --> 02:43:33.670 line:15%
Okay nevermind, I'm not going to send him a message, then.

4147
02:43:33.670 --> 02:43:36.361 line:15%
Well, I mean, you could--
He's gonna be there.

4148
02:43:36.361 --> 02:43:38.667 line:15%
We're right here, right?
Just to clarify--

4149
02:43:38.667 --> 02:43:41.460 line:15%
Actually, North of Kamordah, you're more up there, yeah.

4150
02:43:41.460 --> 02:43:42.930 line:15%
Okay, and the menagerie's here?

4151
02:43:42.930 --> 02:43:46.130 line:15%
Yeah, but it's, Nicodranas is down further, yeah.

4152
02:43:48.370 --> 02:43:52.310 line:15%
And just so I'm clear, we, who right now

4153
02:43:52.310 --> 02:43:55.110 line:15%
are near another destination that we had--

4154
02:43:55.110 --> 02:43:56.630 line:15%
Which is what?
Pride's Call.

4155
02:43:56.630 --> 02:43:58.860 line:15%
There was another item on the to do list.

4156
02:43:58.860 --> 02:44:00.766 line:15%
No no no--
We are going to,

4157
02:44:00.766 --> 02:44:04.600 line:15%
sure sure sure, but we're going to choose not to do that

4158
02:44:04.600 --> 02:44:05.680 line:15%
and instead--
Well, we don't--

4159
02:44:05.680 --> 02:44:09.250 line:15%
Decide to go on a three week long boat trip

4160
02:44:09.250 --> 02:44:11.300 line:15%
to a place that we can get to in one day?

4161
02:44:11.300 --> 02:44:13.580 line:15%
Well, we decided we weren't gonna do Pride's Call

4162
02:44:13.580 --> 02:44:15.210 line:15%
because we decided we didn't need to--

4163
02:44:15.210 --> 02:44:18.620 line:15%
That's fine, but even going to Caduceus' family,

4164
02:44:18.620 --> 02:44:20.160 line:15%
we could get there in a day and a half

4165
02:44:20.160 --> 02:44:22.180 line:15%
versus three weeks of boat trip.

4166
02:44:22.180 --> 02:44:23.840 line:15%
You mean, if we traverse all these mountains

4167
02:44:23.840 --> 02:44:26.660 line:15%
and come down this way?
No, if we teleport

4168
02:44:26.660 --> 02:44:29.120 line:15%
back to Xhorhas and ask Essek to just take us there.

4169
02:44:29.120 --> 02:44:31.730 line:15%
Yeah, that's assuming a lot from Essek, though, right?

4170
02:44:31.730 --> 02:44:33.700 line:15%
You're just like--
I don't know

4171
02:44:33.700 --> 02:44:35.500 line:15%
if I wanna keep burning favors.

4172
02:44:35.500 --> 02:44:37.180 line:15%
I'm happy to just take the journey,

4173
02:44:37.180 --> 02:44:38.450 line:15%
I'm a believer in the journey.
He's our best bud.

4174
02:44:38.450 --> 02:44:40.170 line:15%
He's our--
I can send him a message

4175
02:44:40.170 --> 02:44:41.830 line:15%
and ask him if he can do it.
Yeah, let's ask him.

4176
02:44:41.830 --> 02:44:43.870 line:15%
I mean, we did--
Since he's--

4177
02:44:43.870 --> 02:44:44.750 line:15%
We did help him--
Well--

4178
02:44:44.750 --> 02:44:47.580 line:15%
Make an incredibly powerful spell.

4179
02:44:47.580 --> 02:44:48.490 line:15%
Seems to be--
I'm okay.

4180
02:44:48.490 --> 02:44:51.350 line:15%
I'm personally happy getting on a boat.

4181
02:44:51.350 --> 02:44:53.200 line:15%
I think that sounds like a lotta fun.

4182
02:44:54.700 --> 02:44:58.560 line:15%
Either way, Orly's going to have to meet us.

4183
02:44:58.560 --> 02:45:01.010 line:15%
That boat is gonna take three weeks.

4184
02:45:01.010 --> 02:45:01.843 line:15%
Yeah, the boat's pretty slow.

4185
02:45:01.843 --> 02:45:03.290 line:15%
To get to the other place.
Yeah.

4186
02:45:03.290 --> 02:45:06.690 line:15%
Okay, why don't we ask Essek first?

4187
02:45:06.690 --> 02:45:09.010 line:15%
That's always the first step, right, asking?

4188
02:45:09.010 --> 02:45:09.843 line:15%
Yeah.
Yeah?

4189
02:45:09.843 --> 02:45:11.550 line:15%
All right.
(laughs) Something to put

4190
02:45:11.550 --> 02:45:12.540 line:15%
into practice every time.
I'm gonna

4191
02:45:12.540 --> 02:45:13.740 line:15%
send a message to Essek.

4192
02:45:18.950 --> 02:45:23.340 line:15%
Question: if we needed to teleport somewhere,

4193
02:45:24.600 --> 02:45:27.260 line:15%
would you be able to do it 'cause you love us now?

4194
02:45:30.030 --> 02:45:32.630 line:15%
Or is still, like,

4195
02:45:34.180 --> 02:45:35.013 line:15%
not cool?

4196
02:45:37.073 --> 02:45:39.690 line:15%
Ish.
My ADD was perfect.

4197
02:45:39.690 --> 02:45:43.140 line:15%
Well, that depends on where are you going.

4198
02:45:44.802 --> 02:45:46.230 line:15%
Fuck.
If it is

4199
02:45:46.230 --> 02:45:50.360 line:15%
a place I don't know, there is significant risk.

4200
02:45:50.360 --> 02:45:51.680 line:15%
But possibly.

4201
02:45:54.830 --> 02:45:56.520 line:15%
We did this before, when we were chasing Obann.

4202
02:45:56.520 --> 02:45:57.353 line:15%
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

4203
02:45:57.353 --> 02:45:59.730 line:15%
We just fell through a buncha fuckin' trees.

4204
02:45:59.730 --> 02:46:03.438 line:15%
That's risky.
But I'm into it.

4205
02:46:03.438 --> 02:46:04.271 line:15%
Right?

4206
02:46:04.271 --> 02:46:05.640 line:15%
We're into it?
I mean--

4207
02:46:05.640 --> 02:46:07.290 line:15%
Whatta we wanna do?
It's a great idea.

4208
02:46:07.290 --> 02:46:09.590 line:15%
I think it's actually the fastest way to do it.

4209
02:46:09.590 --> 02:46:13.550 line:15%
And then we do the stuff for Caduceus.

4210
02:46:13.550 --> 02:46:15.270 line:15%
And then--
We can teleport to

4211
02:46:15.270 --> 02:46:16.960 line:15%
Nicodranas.
And then we take a boat

4212
02:46:16.960 --> 02:46:18.210 line:15%
for three weeks.
And then we take a boat.

4213
02:46:18.210 --> 02:46:19.940 line:15%
Yeah.
Well, not for

4214
02:46:19.940 --> 02:46:22.320 line:15%
three weeks, just for a couple weeks.

4215
02:46:22.320 --> 02:46:24.150 line:15%
We go deal with the negotiation

4216
02:46:24.150 --> 02:46:25.700 line:15%
and then we go to Traveler Con.

4217
02:46:27.180 --> 02:46:29.618 line:15%
Are you wanting to take a boat 'cause you wanna--

4218
02:46:29.618 --> 02:46:30.451 line:15%
I was excited on a boat, but--

4219
02:46:30.451 --> 02:46:31.860 line:15%
Are you excited about the boat because

4220
02:46:31.860 --> 02:46:33.920 line:15%
it was gonna stall for another three weeks?

4221
02:46:33.920 --> 02:46:36.510 line:15%
I don't know.
Mmhm.

4222
02:46:37.890 --> 02:46:39.940 line:15%
Caduceus, you're very honest, normally.

4223
02:46:40.887 --> 02:46:41.720 line:15%
Well, if we run out of time--

4224
02:46:41.720 --> 02:46:42.740 line:15%
I think he honestly doesn't know.

4225
02:46:42.740 --> 02:46:46.640 line:15%
I don't know.
We could go to Nicodranas,

4226
02:46:46.640 --> 02:46:49.420 line:15%
get on the boat, go do the negotiation,

4227
02:46:49.420 --> 02:46:53.180 line:15%
go to Traveler Con, and then go do the stuff for your family

4228
02:46:53.180 --> 02:46:55.740 line:15%
if you want to delay.
There is the negotiation.

4229
02:46:57.760 --> 02:46:59.750 line:15%
No.
We have to be on the boat.

4230
02:46:59.750 --> 02:47:02.450 line:15%
No, let's do this, all right.

4231
02:47:02.450 --> 02:47:04.300 line:15%
Fuck yes, let's do this.
Really?

4232
02:47:06.560 --> 02:47:07.393 line:15%
Sure.
Okay.

4233
02:47:08.920 --> 02:47:11.300 line:15%
How much time until Traveler Con?

4234
02:47:11.300 --> 02:47:16.300 line:15%
It's about, I think, four weeks, four to five weeks

4235
02:47:16.320 --> 02:47:18.770 line:15%
at this point, somewhere in that neighborhood.

4236
02:47:18.770 --> 02:47:21.920 line:15%
The negotiation--
It hasn't changed or it's--

4237
02:47:21.920 --> 02:47:23.240 line:15%
I mean, it's only been a couple a days.

4238
02:47:23.240 --> 02:47:24.710 line:15%
Every time I ask, it's like a day.

4239
02:47:24.710 --> 02:47:26.129 line:15%
Yeah.
It's a day.

4240
02:47:26.129 --> 02:47:27.936 line:15%
Yeah, it's between four and five weeks, I think.

4241
02:47:27.936 --> 02:47:28.769 line:15%
People come and go so quickly.

4242
02:47:28.769 --> 02:47:30.940 line:15%
I have everything I need for,

4243
02:47:30.940 --> 02:47:32.480 line:15%
I don't necessarily know what I need to do,

4244
02:47:32.480 --> 02:47:35.160 line:15%
but I've got everything I need to--

4245
02:47:35.160 --> 02:47:37.080 line:15%
You have completed the visions

4246
02:47:37.080 --> 02:47:40.160 line:15%
that brought you to Kravaraad

4247
02:47:41.100 --> 02:47:44.640 line:15%
and you have the materials that you recall in the visions

4248
02:47:44.640 --> 02:47:46.080 line:15%
that you required for the next stage,

4249
02:47:46.080 --> 02:47:50.490 line:15%
but that's all you know.
Okay, yeah.

4250
02:47:52.080 --> 02:47:53.480 line:15%
You wanna try it?
Sure.

4251
02:47:56.911 --> 02:47:59.024 line:15%
All right, let's go to Xhorhas.

4252
02:47:59.024 --> 02:48:01.100 line:15%
(imitated drawing noises)

4253
02:48:01.100 --> 02:48:02.680 line:15%
Ready?
Yeah.

4254
02:48:02.680 --> 02:48:06.958 line:15%
(imitated magical teleportation noises)

4255
02:48:06.958 --> 02:48:09.326 line:15%
Oh, we didn't tell them.

4256
02:48:09.326 --> 02:48:10.179 line:15%
(wretching)

4257
02:48:10.179 --> 02:48:11.012 line:15%
Ah, shit.

4258
02:48:11.012 --> 02:48:12.590 line:15%
(laughing)

4259
02:48:12.590 --> 02:48:15.040 line:15%
We told the one person--
We talked about it.

4260
02:48:16.082 --> 02:48:17.200 line:15%
We talked about it.
That's a step in the

4261
02:48:17.200 --> 02:48:19.015 line:15%
right direction.
Ugh.

4262
02:48:19.015 --> 02:48:20.420 line:15%
Baby steps, guys, baby steps.

4263
02:48:21.286 --> 02:48:22.841 line:15%
(laughing)

4264
02:48:22.841 --> 02:48:24.360 line:15%
We're the worst.
We're incapable of

4265
02:48:24.360 --> 02:48:26.999 line:15%
changing our actions.
We wanted to care.

4266
02:48:26.999 --> 02:48:28.847 line:15%
Nah, really?

4267
02:48:28.847 --> 02:48:29.680 line:15%
(laughing)

4268
02:48:29.680 --> 02:48:31.540 line:15%
We are the worst house guests.

4269
02:48:32.470 --> 02:48:33.303 line:15%
All right.

4270
02:48:34.980 --> 02:48:37.000 line:15%
You all immediately return,

4271
02:48:39.310 --> 02:48:42.953 line:15%
there we go, to the Lucid Bastion basement.

4272
02:48:42.953 --> 02:48:43.786 line:15%
(imitated teleporting noises)

4273
02:48:43.786 --> 02:48:45.760 line:15%
All arriving in the familiar basement,

4274
02:48:45.760 --> 02:48:50.760 line:15%
the posted Aurora Watch spin around just to check,

4275
02:48:51.130 --> 02:48:53.777 line:15%
that brief moment of (grunts)

4276
02:48:53.777 --> 02:48:55.665 line:15%
(sighing)

4277
02:48:55.665 --> 02:48:57.090 line:15%
and then they back to their post.

4278
02:48:57.090 --> 02:48:59.790 line:15%
You walk the familiar crystal-walled halls,

4279
02:49:01.300 --> 02:49:03.380 line:15%
head nods of recognition, though it is bustling,

4280
02:49:03.380 --> 02:49:05.970 line:15%
you can tell that there is kind of an energy here,

4281
02:49:05.970 --> 02:49:09.560 line:15%
probably due to the current kind of

4282
02:49:09.560 --> 02:49:10.940 line:15%
holding of any sort of conflict.

4283
02:49:10.940 --> 02:49:12.780 line:15%
A lotta people are figuring out what to do,

4284
02:49:12.780 --> 02:49:14.270 line:15%
what to watch for, and what to be careful of

4285
02:49:14.270 --> 02:49:16.120 line:15%
in that time period as well as preparations for

4286
02:49:16.120 --> 02:49:19.030 line:15%
this seafront negotiation of which,

4287
02:49:19.030 --> 02:49:21.690 line:15%
while the leaders will not be physically present,

4288
02:49:21.690 --> 02:49:22.940 line:15%
there will be a lot at stake

4289
02:49:22.940 --> 02:49:24.790 line:15%
and on the table for this discussion.

4290
02:49:26.100 --> 02:49:29.280 line:15%
You make your way into the open Gallimaufry,

4291
02:49:29.280 --> 02:49:32.010 line:15%
heading your way towards the neighborhood

4292
02:49:32.010 --> 02:49:37.010 line:15%
where the Xhorhaus resides, the tree greets you,

4293
02:49:37.370 --> 02:49:40.090 line:15%
still glowing in the eternal night that is the city.

4294
02:49:41.860 --> 02:49:45.750 line:15%
You approach the door, chicka-ting-ting-ta-ding,

4295
02:49:45.750 --> 02:49:49.600 line:15%
it opens, and your home is as you left it.

4296
02:49:49.600 --> 02:49:51.350 line:15%
I'm gonna go wash all this poisony

4297
02:49:51.350 --> 02:49:53.650 line:15%
swamp nastiness off of me.

4298
02:49:53.650 --> 02:49:56.350 line:15%
It just occurred to me we have a lot of money.

4299
02:49:57.390 --> 02:49:59.300 line:15%
Should we hire someone to take care of

4300
02:49:59.300 --> 02:50:00.880 line:15%
the house while we're not here?

4301
02:50:00.880 --> 02:50:02.610 line:15%
Well we did, but they up and left.

4302
02:50:02.610 --> 02:50:04.640 line:15%
I don't even know where she went.

4303
02:50:04.640 --> 02:50:08.110 line:15%
She wasn't really hired.
She's an Expositor

4304
02:50:08.110 --> 02:50:10.348 line:15%
of the Cobalt Reserve.
I don't know

4305
02:50:10.348 --> 02:50:11.850 line:15%
what you're talking about, I'm gonna go take a bath.

4306
02:50:14.350 --> 02:50:16.548 line:15%
Should we hire--
No, I don't really care.

4307
02:50:16.548 --> 02:50:17.530 line:15%
I think it's quite nice now.

4308
02:50:17.530 --> 02:50:19.870 line:15%
But there's never any food here when we get back,

4309
02:50:19.870 --> 02:50:22.030 line:15%
we have to go shopping.
That's what Caduceus is for.

4310
02:50:22.030 --> 02:50:23.930 line:15%
I guess so, but--
Caduceus,

4311
02:50:23.930 --> 02:50:26.830 line:15%
can we heat up the hot tub?
Yeah, oh, I can--

4312
02:50:26.830 --> 02:50:28.359 line:15%
We emptied the hot tub.

4313
02:50:28.359 --> 02:50:29.192 line:15%
We have to fill up the hot tub.

4314
02:50:29.192 --> 02:50:31.990 line:15%
I think per the, our servant could do that for us.

4315
02:50:31.990 --> 02:50:32.823 line:15%
Caduceus, could I have a

4316
02:50:32.823 --> 02:50:34.664 line:15%
mushroom and moss sandwich please?

4317
02:50:34.664 --> 02:50:35.497 line:15%
(laughing)

4318
02:50:35.497 --> 02:50:37.367 line:15%
I can do all of these things.

4319
02:50:37.367 --> 02:50:38.879 line:15%
(laughing)

4320
02:50:38.879 --> 02:50:39.910 line:15%
It's still relatively early in the day, right?

4321
02:50:39.910 --> 02:50:42.220 line:15%
We woke up--
At 7 a.m.

4322
02:50:42.220 --> 02:50:43.120 line:15%
Put some stone on the ground--

4323
02:50:43.120 --> 02:50:45.010 line:15%
You did, but you traveled a bit, so you lost a bitta time.

4324
02:50:45.010 --> 02:50:45.940 line:15%
Okay.
So, by the time

4325
02:50:45.940 --> 02:50:49.560 line:15%
you guys had come to and set yourself up

4326
02:50:49.560 --> 02:50:52.400 line:15%
and so, I'd say you woulda left around probably nine.

4327
02:50:53.352 --> 02:50:54.250 line:15%
Okay.
To have gotten

4328
02:50:54.250 --> 02:50:57.200 line:15%
your full rest from the time you did actually sleep.

4329
02:50:57.200 --> 02:50:59.230 line:15%
Getting here, I'd say it's close to midday.

4330
02:50:59.230 --> 02:51:01.110 line:15%
Though, once again, middle of the night--

4331
02:51:01.110 --> 02:51:02.230 line:15%
Right.
Here in

4332
02:51:02.230 --> 02:51:04.120 line:15%
Rosohna most of the time.

4333
02:51:04.120 --> 02:51:05.650 line:15%
So, you're lookin' around noon.

4334
02:51:05.650 --> 02:51:06.483 line:15%
Okay.

4335
02:51:08.870 --> 02:51:11.560 line:15%
So, you begin to prepare--
Go prepare the hot tub

4336
02:51:11.560 --> 02:51:12.690 line:15%
and I'm gonna some sandwiches

4337
02:51:12.690 --> 02:51:14.544 line:15%
for everybody.
Okay, there you go.

4338
02:51:14.544 --> 02:51:16.830 line:15%
A proper moment of downtime. (laughs)

4339
02:51:16.830 --> 02:51:18.180 line:15%
Crusts cut off, I assume.

4340
02:51:20.100 --> 02:51:21.470 line:15%
What?
Crust cut off?

4341
02:51:21.470 --> 02:51:22.990 line:15%
No, that's where all the nutrients are, right?

4342
02:51:22.990 --> 02:51:25.300 line:15%
You said it's all in the crust.

4343
02:51:25.300 --> 02:51:28.000 line:15%
I was just assuming you were gonna be picky.

4344
02:51:28.000 --> 02:51:29.270 line:15%
No.
Oh, all right.

4345
02:51:29.270 --> 02:51:30.990 line:15%
Wait, what kind of sandwich is this?

4346
02:51:30.990 --> 02:51:33.400 line:15%
Mushroom and moss.
Mushroom and moss.

4347
02:51:33.400 --> 02:51:34.390 line:15%
It's an M&amp;M.
Caduceus' special.

4348
02:51:34.390 --> 02:51:37.140 line:15%
Yeah, I'm workin' on it.

4349
02:51:37.140 --> 02:51:38.690 line:15%
Tiny triangles, tiny triangles.

4350
02:51:40.010 --> 02:51:42.450 line:15%
That's very sweet.
Like tea sandwiches.

4351
02:51:42.450 --> 02:51:43.630 line:15%
Oh (laughs) yeah.

4352
02:51:44.710 --> 02:51:46.268 line:15%
(laughing)

4353
02:51:46.268 --> 02:51:47.581 line:15%
I thought it was multi-tiered.

4354
02:51:47.581 --> 02:51:48.761 line:15%
Yeah.
So cute.

4355
02:51:48.761 --> 02:51:50.080 line:15%
(laughing)

4356
02:51:50.080 --> 02:51:51.520 line:15%
Is there any--
Cucumber.

4357
02:51:51.520 --> 02:51:52.490 line:15%
While you're making sandwiches,

4358
02:51:52.490 --> 02:51:54.630 line:15%
you guys have the afternoon here in Rosohna.

4359
02:51:54.630 --> 02:51:56.360 line:15%
Is there anything you want to accomplish while you're

4360
02:51:56.360 --> 02:51:58.560 line:15%
in the city, anything you're looking for or?

4361
02:52:00.250 --> 02:52:02.751 line:15%
Yeah, I want to go shopping.

4362
02:52:02.751 --> 02:52:04.237 line:15%
(laughing)

4363
02:52:04.237 --> 02:52:05.400 line:15%
I have an errand to run.
Okay.

4364
02:52:05.400 --> 02:52:07.580 line:15%
That is, I want to ask around town

4365
02:52:08.700 --> 02:52:10.950 line:15%
and find a magical shop.

4366
02:52:12.430 --> 02:52:15.000 line:15%
Scrolls.
Oh, scrolls in particular.

4367
02:52:15.000 --> 02:52:17.990 line:15%
Yes.
You do know,

4368
02:52:17.990 --> 02:52:19.510 line:15%
there are a couple of small magical shops,

4369
02:52:19.510 --> 02:52:22.190 line:15%
if there is a place to go to get that sort of knowledge.

4370
02:52:23.680 --> 02:52:25.670 line:15%
You can try, first, the Marble Tomes Conservatory

4371
02:52:25.670 --> 02:52:26.840 line:15%
or you can try and look for a place

4372
02:52:26.840 --> 02:52:30.540 line:15%
that's kind of more off the beaten path.

4373
02:52:30.540 --> 02:52:31.373 line:15%
Your call.
I will

4374
02:52:31.373 --> 02:52:33.180 line:15%
go to the Marble Tome Conservatory.

4375
02:52:33.180 --> 02:52:34.730 line:15%
Okay, you do know that place.

4376
02:52:36.365 --> 02:52:37.700 line:15%
It is a little more controlled, you know,

4377
02:52:37.700 --> 02:52:40.100 line:15%
it's definitely more of an established location.

4378
02:52:41.310 --> 02:52:43.620 line:15%
So, who knows?
I can't remember,

4379
02:52:43.620 --> 02:52:48.620 line:15%
Caleb does but I can't, is that a shop or more of a library?

4380
02:52:50.340 --> 02:52:52.940 line:15%
It is a library in a place of learning,

4381
02:52:53.910 --> 02:52:55.630 line:15%
that is where Professor Waccoh is,

4382
02:52:55.630 --> 02:52:57.100 line:15%
but it's also where you have the Enchanter Yun

4383
02:52:57.100 --> 02:52:58.870 line:15%
that made her bracers was.
Okay.

4384
02:52:58.870 --> 02:53:00.590 line:15%
So, you have a rapport there.

4385
02:53:00.590 --> 02:53:01.950 line:15%
Okay.
But it is

4386
02:53:01.950 --> 02:53:03.350 line:15%
more of a place of learning.

4387
02:53:04.430 --> 02:53:05.910 line:15%
It's up to you, if you think the rapport that you have--

4388
02:53:05.910 --> 02:53:08.336 line:15%
I'll look for the shop, I'll look for the shop.

4389
02:53:08.336 --> 02:53:09.169 line:15%
I'm gonna go bargain--
Yeah.

4390
02:53:09.169 --> 02:53:10.500 line:15%
Bargain bin.
Yeah!

4391
02:53:10.500 --> 02:53:11.952 line:15%
Diving.
Make an investigation check

4392
02:53:11.952 --> 02:53:14.287 line:15%
with a disadvantage.
Come on baby, let's go.

4393
02:53:14.287 --> 02:53:15.730 line:15%
$5 DVDs.
Yup.

4394
02:53:15.730 --> 02:53:18.370 line:15%
I will say that--
Actually--

4395
02:53:19.250 --> 02:53:21.670 line:15%
I was about to drop a Fortune's Favor on myself before

4396
02:53:21.670 --> 02:53:23.380 line:15%
heading out the door.
You can do that.

4397
02:53:23.380 --> 02:53:26.480 line:15%
We're gonna make it, just situationally here--

4398
02:53:28.430 --> 02:53:29.763 line:15%
We're property owners.

4399
02:53:29.763 --> 02:53:30.596 line:15%
Persuasion with disadvantage.

4400
02:53:30.596 --> 02:53:31.620 line:15%
Persuasion with disadvantage.

4401
02:53:31.620 --> 02:53:33.830 line:15%
'Cause it's less about discovering the information.

4402
02:53:33.830 --> 02:53:35.130 line:15%
Yeah.
The DC's lower.

4403
02:53:37.060 --> 02:53:40.200 line:15%
But because you are a lone human in the middle of Rosohna,

4404
02:53:41.687 --> 02:53:43.350 line:15%
it is a little more challenging to get information

4405
02:53:43.350 --> 02:53:44.860 line:15%
out of people that don't have a rapport with you.

4406
02:53:44.860 --> 02:53:46.912 line:15%
So, go ahead and roll.
I took out my lil

4407
02:53:46.912 --> 02:53:47.948 line:15%
(package crinkling)

4408
02:53:47.948 --> 02:53:49.510 line:15%
dingle dango.
You do.

4409
02:53:50.980 --> 02:53:52.540 line:15%
And in some places--
So, with Fortune's Favor,

4410
02:53:52.540 --> 02:53:54.250 line:15%
it's a straight roll.
Correct.

4411
02:53:54.250 --> 02:53:56.439 line:15%
Persuasion, you said?
Correct.

4412
02:53:56.439 --> 02:53:57.272 line:15%
(dice clattering)

4413
02:53:57.272 --> 02:54:00.347 line:15%
(laughing)

4414
02:54:00.347 --> 02:54:01.678 line:15%
I'm sorry.
Tink.

4415
02:54:01.678 --> 02:54:04.900 line:15%
You spend the better part of the next two hours

4416
02:54:04.900 --> 02:54:07.310 line:15%
of people sending you, like, "Oh yeah,

4417
02:54:07.310 --> 02:54:08.960 line:15%
"go down this road and find this."

4418
02:54:08.960 --> 02:54:09.950 line:15%
And you get there and there's nothing there

4419
02:54:09.950 --> 02:54:12.050 line:15%
and this one goes like, "Oh, gave you wrong directions.

4420
02:54:12.050 --> 02:54:14.000 line:15%
"You wanna go down this corner around there."

4421
02:54:14.000 --> 02:54:16.620 line:15%
And it takes awhile, in your earnestness,

4422
02:54:16.620 --> 02:54:19.100 line:15%
to realize you've been fucked with.

4423
02:54:19.100 --> 02:54:20.900 line:15%
And you've just lost a couple hours

4424
02:54:20.900 --> 02:54:22.930 line:15%
and you've been even further lost

4425
02:54:22.930 --> 02:54:26.160 line:15%
and you found spaces you've never been to.

4426
02:54:26.160 --> 02:54:29.100 line:15%
You do come across a very large almost a

4427
02:54:29.100 --> 02:54:32.320 line:15%
hedge maze-like garden on the edge of the Gallimaufry,

4428
02:54:32.320 --> 02:54:34.610 line:15%
it's the only thing of interest you come across,

4429
02:54:34.610 --> 02:54:35.610 line:15%
but it is beautiful.

4430
02:54:37.820 --> 02:54:40.520 line:15%
You see an elderly lizardfolk who's out there

4431
02:54:40.520 --> 02:54:42.020 line:15%
kind of tending to the garden.

4432
02:54:43.110 --> 02:54:45.880 line:15%
That's it, that's the only thing of interest you run into.

4433
02:54:45.880 --> 02:54:49.470 line:15%
Job well done, Caleb Widogast.

4434
02:54:49.470 --> 02:54:52.500 line:15%
I Keen Mind follow the trail I took to get to this spot

4435
02:54:52.500 --> 02:54:54.430 line:15%
back home.
Okay, you got it.

4436
02:54:54.430 --> 02:54:57.172 line:15%
Good times.
Sorry, buddy. (laughs)

4437
02:54:57.172 --> 02:54:59.240 line:15%
Anybody else, anything you wanna

4438
02:54:59.240 --> 02:55:00.380 line:15%
accomplish while they're in the city?

4439
02:55:00.380 --> 02:55:02.470 line:15%
I'm making a really nice tub.

4440
02:55:02.470 --> 02:55:04.220 line:15%
It's gonna be--
There you go, some herbs--

4441
02:55:04.220 --> 02:55:05.053 line:15%
Oh yeah.
Get some flowers in it.

4442
02:55:05.053 --> 02:55:06.210 line:15%
Get in a good soak.
Yeah.

4443
02:55:06.210 --> 02:55:07.230 line:15%
There you go.
Candles, the whole--

4444
02:55:07.230 --> 02:55:09.830 line:15%
I'm gonna wander to the Corona District.

4445
02:55:09.830 --> 02:55:13.040 line:15%
Ah, yes.
And see if I can find

4446
02:55:13.040 --> 02:55:16.100 line:15%
a servant for hire.
Okay.

4447
02:55:18.774 --> 02:55:21.800 line:15%
You have a much better time than Caleb did.

4448
02:55:21.800 --> 02:55:22.860 line:15%
Yeah, there is work to be had.

4449
02:55:22.860 --> 02:55:24.050 line:15%
You go into there and you can see

4450
02:55:24.050 --> 02:55:26.700 line:15%
there are a lot of individuals that are

4451
02:55:26.700 --> 02:55:28.550 line:15%
hanging out in front of taverns.

4452
02:55:28.550 --> 02:55:29.910 line:15%
Some of them look relaxing but some of them

4453
02:55:29.910 --> 02:55:32.264 line:15%
when you get close with kinda that look you

4454
02:55:32.264 --> 02:55:33.630 line:15%
in the eye kind of like, "Hey, you there.

4455
02:55:33.630 --> 02:55:34.463 line:15%
"You lookin' to hire?

4456
02:55:34.463 --> 02:55:36.340 line:15%
"You got any building work, you building anything?"

4457
02:55:36.340 --> 02:55:37.320 line:15%
Maybe--
Imagine I can help ya.

4458
02:55:37.320 --> 02:55:39.120 line:15%
Maybe, what's your skill set?

4459
02:55:39.120 --> 02:55:40.720 line:15%
Somebody else is like, "Ah,

4460
02:55:40.720 --> 02:55:42.490 line:15%
"don't listen to him, he's fulla shit.

4461
02:55:42.490 --> 02:55:44.490 line:15%
"Me and Joey over here, we can totally getcha covered,

4462
02:55:44.490 --> 02:55:45.861 line:15%
don't worry."
You and Joey, eh?

4463
02:55:45.861 --> 02:55:48.000 line:15%
Yeah.
What's your skillset?

4464
02:55:48.000 --> 02:55:49.960 line:15%
I'm looking for--
Jodak, but we call him Joey.

4465
02:55:49.960 --> 02:55:53.090 line:15%
In home care, home care.
Yeah, no.

4466
02:55:53.090 --> 02:55:56.660 line:15%
We care about many homes, they're great, is that right?

4467
02:55:56.660 --> 02:55:59.340 line:15%
And he's like, "Yup."
Oh boy.

4468
02:55:59.340 --> 02:56:00.880 line:15%
Yup.
More of like

4469
02:56:00.880 --> 02:56:02.830 line:15%
a butler sort of a thing, I think not.

4470
02:56:02.830 --> 02:56:04.130 line:15%
He changes his posture.

4471
02:56:04.130 --> 02:56:05.360 line:15%
"Of course, we can help you in

4472
02:56:05.360 --> 02:56:06.930 line:15%
"whatever you require, isn't that right?"

4473
02:56:06.930 --> 02:56:10.440 line:15%
The guy's, "Yup."
Hm.

4474
02:56:10.440 --> 02:56:13.070 line:15%
Perfect.
Ah, no thank you.

4475
02:56:13.070 --> 02:56:16.190 line:15%
I'll just keep perusing.
Ah, you son of a bitch!

4476
02:56:16.190 --> 02:56:21.060 line:15%
And he's just kinda screamin' at you. (laughs)

4477
02:56:21.060 --> 02:56:24.790 line:15%
There isn't a housekeeping service necessarily

4478
02:56:26.170 --> 02:56:30.270 line:15%
but I'll say, in asking around, you do come across

4479
02:56:32.670 --> 02:56:37.540 line:15%
this really, really sweet, young kind of bright-eyed

4480
02:56:37.540 --> 02:56:41.370 line:15%
drow girl who has her,

4481
02:56:42.320 --> 02:56:46.160 line:15%
her platinum-white hair goes to almost a purple tint

4482
02:56:46.160 --> 02:56:50.370 line:15%
at the tips and she keeps it very well kept in the back

4483
02:56:50.370 --> 02:56:53.620 line:15%
and kind of tied in two places, she's dressed in

4484
02:56:53.620 --> 02:56:56.930 line:15%
nice, standard clothing and you catch her brooming

4485
02:56:56.930 --> 02:57:00.540 line:15%
on the exterior of what looks to be a small livery.

4486
02:57:02.170 --> 02:57:04.180 line:15%
And immediately you catch the attention

4487
02:57:04.180 --> 02:57:06.940 line:15%
of somebody that looks, you know, non-threatening,

4488
02:57:06.940 --> 02:57:09.040 line:15%
non-aggressive, and, apparently, is clean.

4489
02:57:10.650 --> 02:57:12.670 line:15%
Hello there, young miss.

4490
02:57:13.540 --> 02:57:16.280 line:15%
Do you work here?
I do.

4491
02:57:16.280 --> 02:57:21.180 line:15%
Oh, and your job is to keep things clean and orderly?

4492
02:57:21.180 --> 02:57:23.670 line:15%
That is one of my jobs, yes.

4493
02:57:23.670 --> 02:57:27.130 line:15%
Oh, I'm looking for me, for my friends and I are

4494
02:57:27.130 --> 02:57:32.130 line:15%
looking for someone to help us with our home when we travel.

4495
02:57:32.200 --> 02:57:35.920 line:15%
Would you be available to moonlight in that sort of a job

4496
02:57:35.920 --> 02:57:39.770 line:15%
or are you, you know, on salary here or something?

4497
02:57:39.770 --> 02:57:44.310 line:15%
No, I am, well now, what are you paying, perhaps?

4498
02:57:45.860 --> 02:57:48.770 line:15%
Oh boy.

4499
02:57:48.770 --> 02:57:50.780 line:15%
What do you make here per day?

4500
02:57:52.540 --> 02:57:54.980 line:15%
Well, my standard rate comes to about

4501
02:57:57.100 --> 02:58:01.610 line:15%
one gold five silver.
That sounds fine to me.

4502
02:58:01.610 --> 02:58:03.701 line:15%
Per day?
Sure.

4503
02:58:03.701 --> 02:58:06.619 line:15%
(laughing)

4504
02:58:06.619 --> 02:58:07.473 line:15%
Sure.

4505
02:58:07.473 --> 02:58:08.306 line:15%
(coughing)

4506
02:58:08.306 --> 02:58:09.160 line:15%
Sounds good to me.

4507
02:58:10.620 --> 02:58:12.336 line:15%
She'd be better--
Is there a

4508
02:58:12.336 --> 02:58:15.130 line:15%
monthly rate or is just every day--

4509
02:58:15.130 --> 02:58:19.143 line:15%
This is for an extended engagement--

4510
02:58:19.143 --> 02:58:22.430 line:15%
Yes, we sometimes travel for long periods of time.

4511
02:58:22.430 --> 02:58:25.530 line:15%
And we need to be able to trust you, can we trust you?

4512
02:58:25.530 --> 02:58:27.820 line:15%
Can you trust me?
Insight check.

4513
02:58:27.820 --> 02:58:29.460 line:15%
Go for it.

4514
02:58:29.460 --> 02:58:31.540 line:15%
She gives you these very waifish

4515
02:58:31.540 --> 02:58:33.870 line:15%
doe-like eyes and this soft smile.

4516
02:58:33.870 --> 02:58:36.109 line:15%
21.
21.

4517
02:58:36.109 --> 02:58:37.299 line:15%
(chair scraping)

4518
02:58:37.299 --> 02:58:38.132 line:15%
I get a whisper?
That's right, get up.

4519
02:58:38.132 --> 02:58:39.030 line:15%
I get a whisper outta this.

4520
02:58:39.030 --> 02:58:41.082 line:15%
You notice the hilts of two daggers

4521
02:58:41.082 --> 02:58:41.915 line:15%
poking out of her--
Yeah, no shit.

4522
02:58:41.915 --> 02:58:42.800 line:15%
(laughing)

4523
02:58:42.800 --> 02:58:44.470 line:15%
It's the inevitable end.

4524
02:58:44.470 --> 02:58:46.947 line:15%
Braces, bracers?
This whisper

4525
02:58:46.947 --> 02:58:48.480 line:15%
is brought to you by Skillshare.

4526
02:58:49.811 --> 02:58:51.210 line:15%
Or did I get those?
I've got those bracers.

4527
02:58:51.210 --> 02:58:52.960 line:15%
Yeah.
Wait, you have them?

4528
02:58:52.960 --> 02:58:54.385 line:15%
Do you use them?
Nope--

4529
02:58:54.385 --> 02:58:55.567 line:15%
She made the bracer--
'Cause you

4530
02:58:55.567 --> 02:58:57.060 line:15%
have to have no armor on.

4531
02:58:57.060 --> 02:58:58.130 line:15%
Oh, right.
And you're wearing?

4532
02:58:58.130 --> 02:59:01.100 line:15%
My Frodo armor.
I like you,

4533
02:59:01.100 --> 02:59:03.210 line:15%
I like the cut of your jib.

4534
02:59:03.210 --> 02:59:06.190 line:15%
What's your name, child?
Vidalla.

4535
02:59:06.190 --> 02:59:08.440 line:15%
Vidalla is beautiful.
I don't trust her at all.

4536
02:59:08.440 --> 02:59:10.370 line:15%
Unquestionably beautiful.
She's just gonna

4537
02:59:10.370 --> 02:59:12.620 line:15%
rob us blind.
What do we have in there?

4538
02:59:12.620 --> 02:59:14.680 line:15%
As soon as we leave.
A hot tub and a tree.

4539
02:59:14.680 --> 02:59:16.240 line:15%
How about this, because I know that

4540
02:59:16.240 --> 02:59:19.110 line:15%
my friends would not appreciate me

4541
02:59:19.110 --> 02:59:23.110 line:15%
hiring someone without at least a negotiation.

4542
02:59:23.110 --> 02:59:27.240 line:15%
So, you would do it for one gold, four silver per day?

4543
02:59:28.850 --> 02:59:31.540 line:15%
If that's what would you prefer, of course.

4544
02:59:31.540 --> 02:59:32.770 line:15%
You were talking about a monthly rate,

4545
02:59:32.770 --> 02:59:33.700 line:15%
right?
Yes.

4546
02:59:36.340 --> 02:59:37.580 line:15%
We could go for the daily rate,

4547
02:59:37.580 --> 02:59:39.760 line:15%
if it is something you're more preferring.

4548
02:59:39.760 --> 02:59:42.430 line:15%
For a monthly rate, we could do it for, let's say

4549
02:59:43.930 --> 02:59:45.060 line:15%
40 gold for the month?

4550
02:59:47.996 --> 02:59:49.530 line:15%
I think that works.

4551
02:59:49.530 --> 02:59:52.720 line:15%
Sure, yeah, that sounds great, let's do it.

4552
02:59:52.720 --> 02:59:53.553 line:15%
But you know what?

4553
02:59:53.553 --> 02:59:56.490 line:15%
I can't hire you without introducing you to my friends,

4554
02:59:56.490 --> 02:59:58.440 line:15%
so could you walk across town with me?

4555
02:59:58.440 --> 03:00:00.170 line:15%
I'm a stranger and I'm a goblin.

4556
03:00:01.170 --> 03:00:02.003 line:15%
(laughing)

4557
03:00:02.003 --> 03:00:03.470 line:15%
Certainly.

4558
03:00:03.470 --> 03:00:06.160 line:15%
Goes out and sets the broom back inside and goes,

4559
03:00:06.160 --> 03:00:08.720 line:15%
"Detta, I'm taking my lunch!"

4560
03:00:10.300 --> 03:00:12.288 line:15%
Totally different.
Whenever.

4561
03:00:12.288 --> 03:00:13.749 line:15%
(laughing)
(clapping)

4562
03:00:13.749 --> 03:00:14.849 line:15%
What was that? Okay.

4563
03:00:16.630 --> 03:00:18.640 line:15%
Follow me.
Of course.

4564
03:00:18.640 --> 03:00:20.310 line:15%
All right, I'll walk her back to our place.

4565
03:00:20.310 --> 03:00:22.652 line:15%
Perception!
I'm gonna go--

4566
03:00:22.652 --> 03:00:24.243 line:15%
This is the beginning of the movie Parasite.

4567
03:00:24.243 --> 03:00:25.204 line:15%
(laughing)

4568
03:00:25.204 --> 03:00:27.260 line:15%
Oh my god.
Did you watch it?

4569
03:00:27.260 --> 03:00:30.190 line:15%
Oh yes--
It's so good.

4570
03:00:30.190 --> 03:00:31.950 line:15%
Best movie of last year.
It's so good.

4571
03:00:31.950 --> 03:00:35.050 line:15%
Anyway, continue.
I'm gonna go upstairs

4572
03:00:35.050 --> 03:00:36.300 line:15%
to the tree.
Okay.

4573
03:00:36.300 --> 03:00:38.190 line:15%
To where we have all of our--

4574
03:00:39.730 --> 03:00:42.790 line:15%
Shrines.
Shrines, yes, thank you.

4575
03:00:44.531 --> 03:00:48.290 line:15%
And I'm going to cast Word of Recall.

4576
03:00:50.060 --> 03:00:51.870 line:15%
Where are all these fuckin' spells comin' from?

4577
03:00:51.870 --> 03:00:53.730 line:15%
Oh.
The massive Cleric list.

4578
03:00:53.730 --> 03:00:55.730 line:15%
Shit.
I'm gonna cast

4579
03:00:55.730 --> 03:00:59.690 line:15%
Word of Recall on the little shrine

4580
03:00:59.690 --> 03:01:01.890 line:15%
I've made to the Traveler.
Okay.

4581
03:01:06.753 --> 03:01:07.586 line:15%
Of the lifetime recall.

4582
03:01:10.014 --> 03:01:10.847 line:15%
Oh yeah, well I have--

4583
03:01:13.700 --> 03:01:15.070 line:15%
Ah, you designate the sanctuary.

4584
03:01:15.070 --> 03:01:16.730 line:15%
Yes.
Gotcha, okay.

4585
03:01:18.300 --> 03:01:23.120 line:15%
So, you have now, (sighs) as you complete the spell,

4586
03:01:23.120 --> 03:01:25.260 line:15%
you can see the tree itself suddenly

4587
03:01:25.260 --> 03:01:27.740 line:15%
begins to drop some of its leaves.

4588
03:01:28.610 --> 03:01:31.950 line:15%
These green leaves kinda slowly drift down

4589
03:01:31.950 --> 03:01:35.541 line:15%
and as they hit the ground, a little light kind of

4590
03:01:35.541 --> 03:01:38.070 line:15%
(makes poofing noises) under each one.

4591
03:01:38.960 --> 03:01:41.852 line:15%
Eventually they all shatter (imitates wind)

4592
03:01:41.852 --> 03:01:43.660 line:15%
from a breeze that seems to come from nowhere

4593
03:01:43.660 --> 03:01:46.694 line:15%
and you sense the familiar presence of the Traveler

4594
03:01:46.694 --> 03:01:49.670 line:15%
kind of smiling upon this particular land.

4595
03:01:51.190 --> 03:01:52.140 line:15%
Awesome.
Shit.

4596
03:01:53.800 --> 03:01:54.633 line:15%
Awesome.

4597
03:01:55.480 --> 03:01:56.830 line:15%
Anybody else doing anything?

4598
03:01:57.910 --> 03:01:59.990 line:15%
You don't have to, you can just wait

4599
03:01:59.990 --> 03:02:02.020 line:15%
if you're not particularly going to do something.

4600
03:02:02.020 --> 03:02:06.940 line:15%
Oh, you have the +2 Bracers of Defense, you took them?

4601
03:02:09.000 --> 03:02:10.260 line:15%
Those were +2?
Yeah.

4602
03:02:12.316 --> 03:02:13.610 line:15%
The ones you have are +2 already.

4603
03:02:13.610 --> 03:02:14.970 line:15%
Oh yeah, mine are the exact same.

4604
03:02:14.970 --> 03:02:16.240 line:15%
Okay.
Mm hm.

4605
03:02:16.240 --> 03:02:18.440 line:15%
Yeah, maybe I can sell these or something.

4606
03:02:21.250 --> 03:02:23.500 line:15%
I'll figure it out.
That thing where

4607
03:02:23.500 --> 03:02:25.260 line:15%
you order something online and immediately see

4608
03:02:25.260 --> 03:02:27.372 line:15%
something just slightly better after that.

4609
03:02:27.372 --> 03:02:28.205 line:15%
(laughing)

4610
03:02:28.205 --> 03:02:29.470 line:15%
I have a better price.
Yeah.

4611
03:02:29.470 --> 03:02:32.570 line:15%
It's like $8 cheaper and it comes with another option.

4612
03:02:32.570 --> 03:02:35.080 line:15%
But you can only wear 'em if you're not wearing armor.

4613
03:02:35.080 --> 03:02:36.850 line:15%
Oh, yeah, maybe I'm armor on--

4614
03:02:36.850 --> 03:02:39.340 line:15%
Yeah, you got armor on.
I'm not sure.

4615
03:02:39.340 --> 03:02:40.350 line:15%
Yeah, you can't be wearing armor.

4616
03:02:40.350 --> 03:02:41.892 line:15%
Oh yeah, 'cause it ups your

4617
03:02:41.892 --> 03:02:42.930 line:15%
armor class.
Yeah.

4618
03:02:42.930 --> 03:02:45.830 line:15%
No shield, no armor.
Got it.

4619
03:02:45.830 --> 03:02:48.320 line:15%
Can you, Nott?
Nott has armor.

4620
03:02:48.320 --> 03:02:50.060 line:15%
Nott has armor, nevermind.

4621
03:02:50.060 --> 03:02:51.910 line:15%
Everybody's got armor now.
Everybody's got armor.

4622
03:02:51.910 --> 03:02:55.160 line:15%
Jester, can I play with Sprinkle for a little bit?

4623
03:02:56.956 --> 03:02:59.680 line:15%
I'm sure Sprinkle would love that!

4624
03:02:59.680 --> 03:03:02.700 line:15%
Don't bite her, okay?
Thank you.

4625
03:03:02.700 --> 03:03:03.740 line:15%
He's a little, um,

4626
03:03:06.910 --> 03:03:09.670 line:15%
skittish.
Okay, I'll be very careful.

4627
03:03:11.354 --> 03:03:14.354 line:15%
(weasel chittering)

4628
03:03:15.370 --> 03:03:17.200 line:15%
I'm gonna take him and try to give him

4629
03:03:17.200 --> 03:03:19.986 line:15%
a little bath and fluff him up in the hot tub.

4630
03:03:19.986 --> 03:03:22.139 line:15%
Okay.
Oh, he's gonna hate it.

4631
03:03:22.139 --> 03:03:26.540 line:15%
Now, to be specific here, based on recent adventures

4632
03:03:26.540 --> 03:03:28.820 line:15%
and the return from where you were,

4633
03:03:28.820 --> 03:03:31.530 line:15%
it very much looks like one of those viral videos

4634
03:03:31.530 --> 03:03:34.057 line:15%
when they're cleaning animals after an oil spill.

4635
03:03:34.057 --> 03:03:35.920 line:15%
(laughing)

4636
03:03:35.920 --> 03:03:38.010 line:15%
Sprinkle is just like (imitates hacking weasel).

4637
03:03:39.124 --> 03:03:39.957 line:15%
(laughing)

4638
03:03:39.957 --> 03:03:40.910 line:15%
The Dove commercial.
That's the same thought

4639
03:03:41.986 --> 03:03:42.819 line:15%
I had.
I'm sitting in the

4640
03:03:42.819 --> 03:03:45.710 line:15%
corner of the hot tub with my plate of sandwiches, just--

4641
03:03:45.710 --> 03:03:47.698 line:15%
Look, I haven't been giving,

4642
03:03:47.698 --> 03:03:48.690 line:15%
I didn't give him a bath 'cause he almost drowned

4643
03:03:48.690 --> 03:03:50.530 line:15%
and he's like Nott and I thought maybe

4644
03:03:50.530 --> 03:03:52.000 line:15%
he didn't want to be in the water, is all.

4645
03:03:52.000 --> 03:03:54.250 line:15%
No no no, we all were so messy and I just,

4646
03:03:54.250 --> 03:03:57.660 line:15%
I thought he could just, you know, get him all fluffy--

4647
03:03:57.660 --> 03:03:58.870 line:15%
He seems like he likes it, so

4648
03:03:58.870 --> 03:04:01.208 line:15%
you're doing a good thing.
Yeah yeah yeah, okay okay.

4649
03:04:01.208 --> 03:04:02.310 line:15%
Also, a bunch of zombies exploded acid

4650
03:04:02.310 --> 03:04:03.682 line:15%
all over him.
Yeah.

4651
03:04:03.682 --> 03:04:06.250 line:15%
(laughing)

4652
03:04:06.250 --> 03:04:08.430 line:15%
He was protected, he was in my hood, that's why.

4653
03:04:08.430 --> 03:04:10.787 line:15%
Bold move, bold move bathing a dead animal.

4654
03:04:10.787 --> 03:04:12.794 line:15%
(laughing)

4655
03:04:12.794 --> 03:04:14.137 line:15%
You have to prepare them--
Five cents a day.

4656
03:04:14.137 --> 03:04:16.387 line:15%
(laughing)

4657
03:04:17.793 --> 03:04:19.290 line:15%
But nevertheless, you do eventually clean Sprinkle off

4658
03:04:19.290 --> 03:04:21.710 line:15%
and it's a good thing you're a Barbarian.

4659
03:04:21.710 --> 03:04:23.060 line:15%
Your hands are pretty tough

4660
03:04:24.885 --> 03:04:28.530 line:15%
and the shear amount of bites that would've

4661
03:04:28.530 --> 03:04:33.480 line:15%
definitely hamburgered someone with a softer grip's hands--

4662
03:04:33.480 --> 03:04:35.210 line:15%
For the price of a coffee.

4663
03:04:35.210 --> 03:04:38.970 line:15%
Your thick skin in your mitts, fairly resistant,

4664
03:04:38.970 --> 03:04:40.630 line:15%
especially when it starts pissing you off and you start

4665
03:04:40.630 --> 03:04:42.130 line:15%
rage washing it.
Oh.

4666
03:04:42.130 --> 03:04:44.137 line:15%
You take half the bite damage from the little--

4667
03:04:44.137 --> 03:04:45.632 line:15%
(laughing)

4668
03:04:45.632 --> 03:04:46.940 line:15%
Oh no.
The little weasel.

4669
03:04:49.282 --> 03:04:51.320 line:15%
I'm gonna towel him off and make him all fluffy.

4670
03:04:51.320 --> 03:04:52.936 line:15%
Make him look all cute.

4671
03:04:52.936 --> 03:04:53.952 line:15%
(snarling)

4672
03:04:53.952 --> 03:04:55.003 line:15%
(imitated poofing)

4673
03:04:55.003 --> 03:04:57.183 line:15%
(laughing)

4674
03:04:57.183 --> 03:05:00.330 line:15%
Whoa, whoa, what weasel smells

4675
03:05:00.330 --> 03:05:02.148 line:15%
so bad?
That's stinky.

4676
03:05:02.148 --> 03:05:04.456 line:15%
(laughing)

4677
03:05:04.456 --> 03:05:07.270 line:15%
I wanna put a little flower on him, see if it stays.

4678
03:05:07.270 --> 03:05:10.810 line:15%
Through the process, roll an animal handling for me.

4679
03:05:10.810 --> 03:05:12.490 line:15%
Yes.
I'm curious.

4680
03:05:12.490 --> 03:05:13.390 line:15%
Oh boy.
Yeah.

4681
03:05:14.430 --> 03:05:15.585 line:15%
Please be one.

4682
03:05:15.585 --> 03:05:17.122 line:15%
(dice clattering)

4683
03:05:17.122 --> 03:05:17.955 line:15%
(laughing)

4684
03:05:17.955 --> 03:05:19.968 line:15%
Well.
Three.

4685
03:05:19.968 --> 03:05:22.135 line:15%
(laughing)

4686
03:05:22.135 --> 03:05:24.428 line:15%
(makes breaking noise) Oh!
So, when--

4687
03:05:24.428 --> 03:05:26.678 line:15%
(laughing)

4688
03:05:28.152 --> 03:05:29.352 line:15%
No, no, no.
No, no.

4689
03:05:31.027 --> 03:05:32.373 line:15%
No, but--

4690
03:05:32.373 --> 03:05:33.206 line:15%
(laughing)

4691
03:05:33.206 --> 03:05:34.039 line:15%
Mending, mending.

4692
03:05:34.039 --> 03:05:34.872 line:15%
(laughing)

4693
03:05:34.872 --> 03:05:39.390 line:15%
As Yasha brings you back your sweet weasel, it's less of

4694
03:05:39.390 --> 03:05:42.950 line:15%
a presentation and more of a, "Take it from me."

4695
03:05:42.950 --> 03:05:45.208 line:15%
It's going (imitates angry weasel)

4696
03:05:45.208 --> 03:05:46.041 line:15%
and it's actually in the process of gnawing--

4697
03:05:46.041 --> 03:05:48.020 line:15%
Okay, okay, okay, okay.
Oh, that was so

4698
03:05:48.020 --> 03:05:50.200 line:15%
sweet of you, Yasha.
He just, he was

4699
03:05:50.200 --> 03:05:51.860 line:15%
a little bit of, we all were a mess and--

4700
03:05:51.860 --> 03:05:54.478 line:15%
Oh, he looks so cute now.
He's gonna look

4701
03:05:54.478 --> 03:05:56.210 line:15%
so much better, you know, on your--

4702
03:05:56.210 --> 03:05:59.204 line:15%
He's got a flower on him.

4703
03:05:59.204 --> 03:06:00.320 line:15%
Here.

4704
03:06:00.320 --> 03:06:01.923 line:15%
Ah!
He's--

4705
03:06:01.923 --> 03:06:03.920 line:15%
(laughing)

4706
03:06:03.920 --> 03:06:06.320 line:15%
He's, it's weird because he's not very friendly.

4707
03:06:07.210 --> 03:06:09.460 line:15%
(laughing)

4708
03:06:11.717 --> 03:06:12.550 line:15%
He gets really worked up.

4709
03:06:12.550 --> 03:06:13.383 line:15%
Caduceus?
Yeah?

4710
03:06:14.362 --> 03:06:17.210 line:15%
Do you any, like, little bugs or pieces of meat

4711
03:06:17.210 --> 03:06:19.360 line:15%
or anything you can give him?
He might be hungry.

4712
03:06:19.360 --> 03:06:22.870 line:15%
I'm gonna, would you like a sandwich?

4713
03:06:23.790 --> 03:06:26.240 line:15%
Would you like a sandwich?
He calms a bit.

4714
03:06:26.240 --> 03:06:28.002 line:15%
Yeah, yeah, he wants a sandwich.

4715
03:06:28.002 --> 03:06:30.341 line:15%
Ah, come here.

4716
03:06:30.341 --> 03:06:33.200 line:15%
(curious weasel chittering)

4717
03:06:33.200 --> 03:06:34.033 line:15%
(nibbling)

4718
03:06:34.033 --> 03:06:34.866 line:15%
There you go.

4719
03:06:35.960 --> 03:06:37.260 line:15%
You want another sandwich?

4720
03:06:38.189 --> 03:06:39.118 line:15%
(weasel chitter)

4721
03:06:39.118 --> 03:06:42.292 line:15%
Yes and also, also for me, thank you.

4722
03:06:42.292 --> 03:06:44.570 line:15%
(chuckling)

4723
03:06:44.570 --> 03:06:46.500 line:15%
Eventually, you calm.

4724
03:06:46.500 --> 03:06:48.797 line:15%
(laughing)

4725
03:06:48.797 --> 03:06:52.997 line:15%
Sprinkle is definitely already kind of reticent

4726
03:06:52.997 --> 03:06:55.720 line:15%
around Yasha.
Oh.

4727
03:06:55.720 --> 03:06:57.560 line:15%
You could work towards it, but it's

4728
03:06:57.560 --> 03:06:58.960 line:15%
a step back in that relationship.

4729
03:06:58.960 --> 03:07:02.020 line:15%
I don't need to, I think, he just was looking

4730
03:07:02.020 --> 03:07:04.060 line:15%
a little weird.
But right now,

4731
03:07:04.060 --> 03:07:06.200 line:15%
it does look like a very nice kind of

4732
03:07:06.200 --> 03:07:08.600 line:15%
boa right now with the fluffed up red hair.

4733
03:07:10.300 --> 03:07:12.640 line:15%
Thank you, Yasha.
You're welcome.

4734
03:07:12.640 --> 03:07:14.920 line:15%
You look good, Sprinkle.
It looks really good now.

4735
03:07:14.920 --> 03:07:17.020 line:15%
It's like a really nice--
Yeah.

4736
03:07:17.020 --> 03:07:18.370 line:15%
Ding ga-ling-ling.
Oh.

4737
03:07:19.240 --> 03:07:21.640 line:15%
Company, family meeting, house meeting.

4738
03:07:22.952 --> 03:07:25.698 line:15%
I'm telling him.
Wow.

4739
03:07:25.698 --> 03:07:29.200 line:15%
I've got to introduce you to your potential employers.

4740
03:07:29.200 --> 03:07:30.870 line:15%
They might have some questions about

4741
03:07:30.870 --> 03:07:34.460 line:15%
your CV and your past work experience.

4742
03:07:34.460 --> 03:07:35.370 line:15%
Of course, of course.

4743
03:07:35.370 --> 03:07:38.300 line:15%
Nott, what the fuck?
No no, this is fine.

4744
03:07:38.300 --> 03:07:41.810 line:15%
I've brought a young lady here, her name is Vendetta,

4745
03:07:41.810 --> 03:07:44.020 line:15%
if I remember--
Vendetta?

4746
03:07:44.020 --> 03:07:45.660 line:15%
I don't really remember, was it--

4747
03:07:45.660 --> 03:07:48.256 line:15%
What's your name?
Your name is Vendetta?

4748
03:07:48.256 --> 03:07:49.491 line:15%
That's not my--
Be nice.

4749
03:07:49.491 --> 03:07:50.853 line:15%
What?

4750
03:07:50.853 --> 03:07:52.580 line:15%
(laughs) She introduces herself.

4751
03:07:54.234 --> 03:07:56.000 line:15%
Do you guys have any particular questions, like,

4752
03:07:56.000 --> 03:07:59.170 line:15%
I don't know how much time you wanna spend on this.

4753
03:07:59.170 --> 03:08:00.519 line:15%
All of it.
Okay.

4754
03:08:00.519 --> 03:08:01.430 line:15%
(laughing)

4755
03:08:01.430 --> 03:08:02.720 line:15%
Yeah, totally.
Someone to just

4756
03:08:02.720 --> 03:08:06.556 line:15%
steal things from us.
Of course.

4757
03:08:06.556 --> 03:08:09.750 line:15%
This could be our person who takes care of the home

4758
03:08:09.750 --> 03:08:11.210 line:15%
when we are away.
Oh, okay.

4759
03:08:11.210 --> 03:08:14.020 line:15%
'Cause she, I know her qualifications are

4760
03:08:14.020 --> 03:08:17.580 line:15%
she can use a broom and she speaks our language.

4761
03:08:17.580 --> 03:08:19.270 line:15%
Oh, that's wonderful.

4762
03:08:19.270 --> 03:08:21.710 line:15%
Do you steal things?
No.

4763
03:08:21.710 --> 03:08:23.480 line:15%
Why would I steal something?
Well that's excellent.

4764
03:08:23.480 --> 03:08:24.600 line:15%
We have the ability to monitor

4765
03:08:24.600 --> 03:08:26.620 line:15%
every room in this house, so--

4766
03:08:26.620 --> 03:08:28.290 line:15%
Why wouldn't you steal things?

4767
03:08:28.290 --> 03:08:29.710 line:15%
Beau, what, what are you--

4768
03:08:29.710 --> 03:08:31.970 line:15%
No, I mean, you only should trust someone

4769
03:08:31.970 --> 03:08:35.060 line:15%
who knows that they could steal things but then also has

4770
03:08:35.060 --> 03:08:37.460 line:15%
the restraint and the loyalty to know that they shouldn't.

4771
03:08:37.460 --> 03:08:38.930 line:15%
I'm gonna cast Zone of Truth.

4772
03:08:38.930 --> 03:08:40.160 line:15%
All right, you cast Zone of Truth.

4773
03:08:40.160 --> 03:08:42.770 line:15%
On all of us, as many people that I can--

4774
03:08:42.770 --> 03:08:44.650 line:15%
Everyone make wisdom saving throws.

4775
03:08:44.650 --> 03:08:45.834 line:15%
Oh my god.

4776
03:08:45.834 --> 03:08:47.500 line:15%
(dice clattering)

4777
03:08:47.500 --> 03:08:49.010 line:15%
10.
Natural 20.

4778
03:08:49.971 --> 03:08:50.804 line:15%
Aw.
Oh.

4779
03:08:50.804 --> 03:08:51.637 line:15%
21.

4780
03:08:52.710 --> 03:08:53.690 line:15%
13.
Seven.

4781
03:08:55.130 --> 03:08:58.090 line:15%
I'm just gonna lie about everything 'cause I can.

4782
03:08:58.090 --> 03:08:59.870 line:15%
Five.
So Yasha,

4783
03:08:59.870 --> 03:09:02.050 line:15%
Fjord, and Caleb--
And me.

4784
03:09:02.050 --> 03:09:04.460 line:15%
And Nott fail.
And so does she.

4785
03:09:04.460 --> 03:09:05.293 line:15%
Okay, good.

4786
03:09:07.660 --> 03:09:08.493 line:15%
All right.

4787
03:09:09.760 --> 03:09:13.430 line:15%
Are you trustworthy?
I like to think so.

4788
03:09:13.430 --> 03:09:15.110 line:15%
This would be a better job than

4789
03:09:15.110 --> 03:09:17.220 line:15%
the one I currently have and--

4790
03:09:17.220 --> 03:09:19.520 line:15%
How much do you currently make?

4791
03:09:19.520 --> 03:09:21.310 line:15%
Currently, I make about, heh,

4792
03:09:24.260 --> 03:09:26.530 line:15%
four silver pieces a day.
Wait!

4793
03:09:26.530 --> 03:09:29.200 line:15%
That, oh, interesting.
No, what?

4794
03:09:29.200 --> 03:09:30.110 line:15%
No.
No, keep goin'.

4795
03:09:30.110 --> 03:09:31.150 line:15%
How much--
I was gonna say--

4796
03:09:31.150 --> 03:09:32.930 line:15%
Cleaning--
"Wait, that seems low."

4797
03:09:32.930 --> 03:09:34.750 line:15%
Horse and moorbounder manure.

4798
03:09:35.816 --> 03:09:36.649 line:15%
Oh.
Oh.

4799
03:09:36.649 --> 03:09:38.090 line:15%
Do you clean houses?

4800
03:09:38.090 --> 03:09:40.360 line:15%
I have before but it's been some time.

4801
03:09:40.360 --> 03:09:42.210 line:15%
You guys got this?
Mm hm.

4802
03:09:42.210 --> 03:09:43.043 line:15%
Okay good.
Don't you wanna

4803
03:09:43.043 --> 03:09:44.440 line:15%
ask something?
No, I'm good.

4804
03:09:44.440 --> 03:09:46.450 line:15%
Whatta you mean you're good?

4805
03:09:46.450 --> 03:09:48.280 line:15%
Do we all need to be here as we interview

4806
03:09:48.280 --> 03:09:50.130 line:15%
the housekeeper?
Yes!

4807
03:09:50.130 --> 03:09:51.320 line:15%
This is a house meeting.

4808
03:09:51.320 --> 03:09:53.290 line:15%
I said house meeting, that means the whole house.

4809
03:09:53.290 --> 03:09:54.640 line:15%
What's your biggest fear?

4810
03:09:55.531 --> 03:09:58.331 line:15%
Do you have any experience taking care of houseplants?

4811
03:10:01.038 --> 03:10:03.760 line:15%
(thoughtful humming)

4812
03:10:03.760 --> 03:10:05.202 line:15%
No.

4813
03:10:05.202 --> 03:10:07.780 line:15%
Do you feel prepared to learn how to take care of plants?

4814
03:10:07.780 --> 03:10:10.085 line:15%
I think so.
Okay.

4815
03:10:10.085 --> 03:10:11.080 line:15%
Do you like me?

4816
03:10:11.986 --> 03:10:12.819 line:15%
(laughing)

4817
03:10:12.819 --> 03:10:16.670 line:15%
You seem aggressively likable.

4818
03:10:17.960 --> 03:10:20.690 line:15%
I like you.
Are you afraid of weasels?

4819
03:10:20.690 --> 03:10:24.160 line:15%
Why?
She's afraid of weasels.

4820
03:10:24.160 --> 03:10:25.510 line:15%
What's your favorite color?

4821
03:10:27.150 --> 03:10:29.010 line:15%
Blue?
What's your favorite color?

4822
03:10:29.010 --> 03:10:30.760 line:15%
Green.
Who are you asking?

4823
03:10:30.760 --> 03:10:32.401 line:15%
You.
Oh, blue.

4824
03:10:32.401 --> 03:10:35.040 line:15%
Green.
What's your favorite color?

4825
03:10:36.660 --> 03:10:40.100 line:15%
Oh, I don't have one.
Oh, that's weird.

4826
03:10:40.100 --> 03:10:43.210 line:15%
Wait, you don't have one?
That is weird.

4827
03:10:43.210 --> 03:10:45.810 line:15%
I mean, I've known you for so long and that is

4828
03:10:45.810 --> 03:10:47.190 line:15%
the weirdest thing--
Nott, favorite color.

4829
03:10:47.190 --> 03:10:49.033 line:15%
Yellow.
Oh, well.

4830
03:10:49.033 --> 03:10:50.374 line:15%
(laughing)

4831
03:10:50.374 --> 03:10:51.207 line:15%
I don't pick favorites.

4832
03:10:51.207 --> 03:10:52.850 line:15%
But how do you see the world?

4833
03:10:52.850 --> 03:10:55.010 line:15%
Silver.
Silver?

4834
03:10:55.010 --> 03:10:56.459 line:15%
Yeah.
Nice.

4835
03:10:56.459 --> 03:10:57.743 line:15%
That's a good color.
See that?

4836
03:10:57.743 --> 03:10:58.576 line:15%
What about yours, Jester?
Pink.

4837
03:10:59.684 --> 03:11:00.830 line:15%
How do I see color, is that what you're asking?

4838
03:11:00.830 --> 03:11:02.740 line:15%
Yeah.
We will have some

4839
03:11:02.740 --> 03:11:04.790 line:15%
important things we need to get to if, you know--

4840
03:11:04.790 --> 03:11:07.130 line:15%
Yeah, yeah, you're totally right.

4841
03:11:07.130 --> 03:11:09.390 line:15%
Does anybody have a crush on me?

4842
03:11:09.390 --> 03:11:10.936 line:15%
Oh.
Jester,

4843
03:11:10.936 --> 03:11:13.690 line:15%
you know everyone does.
What?

4844
03:11:13.690 --> 03:11:15.880 line:15%
No.
Okay, back to you, though.

4845
03:11:17.090 --> 03:11:20.660 line:15%
What's the most expensive silverware you've ever stolen?

4846
03:11:20.660 --> 03:11:22.410 line:15%
I've never stolen--
Lies.

4847
03:11:22.410 --> 03:11:23.310 line:15%
She's lying.
No she's not,

4848
03:11:23.310 --> 03:11:24.160 line:15%
she's telling the truth.

4849
03:11:24.160 --> 03:11:26.110 line:15%
You're right, she's telling the truth.

4850
03:11:27.190 --> 03:11:28.352 line:15%
What did you tell,

4851
03:11:28.352 --> 03:11:30.602 line:15%
(laughing)

4852
03:11:31.644 --> 03:11:34.670 line:15%
what did you tell her?
What are you talking about?

4853
03:11:34.670 --> 03:11:36.282 line:15%
Beau, are you drunk?

4854
03:11:36.282 --> 03:11:38.030 line:15%
(sighing)

4855
03:11:38.030 --> 03:11:40.240 line:15%
I don't trust her.

4856
03:11:40.240 --> 03:11:42.454 line:15%
If you don't trust me, I can go.

4857
03:11:42.454 --> 03:11:44.340 line:15%
No, no, no, no--
Let's put it to a vote.

4858
03:11:44.340 --> 03:11:45.880 line:15%
Yes, let's vote.
All in favor--

4859
03:11:45.880 --> 03:11:47.050 line:15%
Do you have good intentions here?

4860
03:11:47.050 --> 03:11:48.480 line:15%
Do you want to keep a job here?

4861
03:11:48.480 --> 03:11:50.230 line:15%
Are you going to try to do anything shady?

4862
03:11:50.230 --> 03:11:52.350 line:15%
Those are different--
Yeah, but--

4863
03:11:54.490 --> 03:11:58.540 line:15%
I would like, I have good intentions, I would like to,

4864
03:11:58.540 --> 03:12:02.030 line:15%
you know, live above the current means that I do.

4865
03:12:04.040 --> 03:12:08.750 line:15%
If you are people that are very difficult to work with

4866
03:12:08.750 --> 03:12:10.620 line:15%
and keep, then I wouldn't stay in this job.

4867
03:12:10.620 --> 03:12:11.600 line:15%
We're not, we're never here.

4868
03:12:11.600 --> 03:12:13.110 line:15%
Let's vote, all in favor.

4869
03:12:14.395 --> 03:12:15.700 line:15%
Yeah, of course.
Hey, you're hired.

4870
03:12:15.700 --> 03:12:17.070 line:15%
Congratulations, when can you start?

4871
03:12:17.070 --> 03:12:18.370 line:15%
How much do you make?

4872
03:12:18.370 --> 03:12:21.430 line:15%
We had discussed 40 gold each month for the housekeeping--

4873
03:12:21.430 --> 03:12:23.140 line:15%
Holy fucking shit--
Nott,

4874
03:12:23.140 --> 03:12:25.620 line:15%
that's what I'm talkin' about, that's what--

4875
03:12:25.620 --> 03:12:26.453 line:15%
What's wrong with that?

4876
03:12:26.453 --> 03:12:28.061 line:15%
Maybe she drove a hard bargain.

4877
03:12:28.061 --> 03:12:29.340 line:15%
It's insane.
Is that insane?

4878
03:12:29.340 --> 03:12:30.590 line:15%
We have lots of money.

4879
03:12:30.590 --> 03:12:32.890 line:15%
She currently makes four silver.

4880
03:12:32.890 --> 03:12:34.923 line:15%
This would be a raise.
Is that high,

4881
03:12:34.923 --> 03:12:36.300 line:15%
did you quote something very high for us?

4882
03:12:36.300 --> 03:12:37.180 line:15%
I have a turnip, give me--

4883
03:12:37.180 --> 03:12:39.680 line:15%
It would be better than what I'm making now at the--

4884
03:12:39.680 --> 03:12:43.230 line:15%
Yeah, by 5,000%
Stables.

4885
03:12:43.230 --> 03:12:45.550 line:15%
We'll pay it, you're hired, you start today.

4886
03:12:45.550 --> 03:12:47.280 line:15%
Thank you very much.

4887
03:12:47.280 --> 03:12:48.460 line:15%
I'll get my stuff.

4888
03:12:48.460 --> 03:12:50.910 line:15%
She's a grifter, I can smell it on her.

4889
03:12:50.910 --> 03:12:54.020 line:15%
One recognizes one of their own, all right?

4890
03:12:54.020 --> 03:12:55.980 line:15%
You say that about literally everyone

4891
03:12:55.980 --> 03:12:57.452 line:15%
we meet.
Yeah, you're projecting

4892
03:12:57.452 --> 03:12:59.448 line:15%
super hard right now.
Yeah, you're probably right.

4893
03:12:59.448 --> 03:13:00.281 line:15%
(laughing)

4894
03:13:00.281 --> 03:13:01.300 line:15%
All right.

4895
03:13:01.300 --> 03:13:02.390 line:15%
Take care of the house.

4896
03:13:02.390 --> 03:13:04.705 line:15%
We don't have any keys, guard the door if you like.

4897
03:13:04.705 --> 03:13:06.220 line:15%
(laughing)

4898
03:13:06.220 --> 03:13:08.210 line:15%
Am I starting now or tomorrow?

4899
03:13:08.210 --> 03:13:09.410 line:15%
Immediately.
Yeah,

4900
03:13:09.410 --> 03:13:10.430 line:15%
you can start right away.
Okay.

4901
03:13:10.430 --> 03:13:12.398 line:15%
You sleep in the hot tub at night.

4902
03:13:12.398 --> 03:13:13.231 line:15%
No, no.
And you can't tell

4903
03:13:13.231 --> 03:13:14.600 line:15%
your previous employers.
She's lying.

4904
03:13:14.600 --> 03:13:15.800 line:15%
You can't speak to your previous employers.

4905
03:13:15.800 --> 03:13:17.292 line:15%
You can't lie.
If you do,

4906
03:13:17.292 --> 03:13:18.125 line:15%
they'll be killed.
That was a joke,

4907
03:13:18.125 --> 03:13:20.264 line:15%
it wasn't a lie. (laughs)
That's not true,

4908
03:13:20.264 --> 03:13:22.950 line:15%
I can't say that. (laughs)
Okay.

4909
03:13:22.950 --> 03:13:25.900 line:15%
Sorta true.
This is very strange house.

4910
03:13:25.900 --> 03:13:27.970 line:15%
We're aware.
We're glad you're here.

4911
03:13:27.970 --> 03:13:29.390 line:15%
Can we go now?
Yeah.

4912
03:13:29.390 --> 03:13:31.720 line:15%
We're going to--
Essek.

4913
03:13:31.720 --> 03:13:33.670 line:15%
Oh, to Essek.
Are you leaving now?

4914
03:13:34.740 --> 03:13:36.390 line:15%
Just asking, it's up to you guys.

4915
03:13:39.760 --> 03:13:41.130 line:15%
I mean, what else are we going to do?

4916
03:13:41.130 --> 03:13:43.130 line:15%
Yeah, let's go.
Yeah, we should just go.

4917
03:13:43.130 --> 03:13:44.800 line:15%
Thank you, watch the place.

4918
03:13:44.800 --> 03:13:45.980 line:15%
There's instructions on how to

4919
03:13:45.980 --> 03:13:48.546 line:15%
take care of the plants in the kitchen.

4920
03:13:48.546 --> 03:13:49.379 line:15%
(laughing)

4921
03:13:49.379 --> 03:13:50.297 line:15%
Okay.

4922
03:13:50.297 --> 03:13:51.420 line:15%
I have a question.
Yes.

4923
03:13:51.420 --> 03:13:53.260 line:15%
If I cast something from a wand,

4924
03:13:53.260 --> 03:13:55.210 line:15%
do I need the spell components for it

4925
03:13:55.210 --> 03:13:57.310 line:15%
or does it cancel it 'cause I have a wand?

4926
03:13:58.400 --> 03:14:02.704
It'll usually say for most wand-based magical items,

4927
03:14:02.704 --> 03:14:05.140 line:15%
"Without material components."
Okay.

4928
03:14:05.140 --> 03:14:06.800 line:15%
I think the wand handles it, I don't think

4929
03:14:06.800 --> 03:14:08.060 line:15%
you need the components for the wand--

4930
03:14:08.060 --> 03:14:09.580 line:15%
Got it, okay.
I think.

4931
03:14:09.580 --> 03:14:11.950 line:15%
What wand do you have?
Pretty sure.

4932
03:14:13.270 --> 03:14:15.760 line:15%
I have the Wand of the Solitary Scout

4933
03:14:15.760 --> 03:14:16.830 line:15%
and I have the Wand of Smiles.

4934
03:14:16.830 --> 03:14:19.460 line:15%
You don't the guano if you're using

4935
03:14:19.460 --> 03:14:21.190 line:15%
a Wand of Fireballs or anything,

4936
03:14:21.190 --> 03:14:23.060 line:15%
it's part of the enchantment that the wand handles it,

4937
03:14:23.060 --> 03:14:24.950 line:15%
I'm pretty sure.
Wands up.

4938
03:14:25.810 --> 03:14:29.330 line:15%
It's rolled in the phosphorus like a churro.

4939
03:14:29.330 --> 03:14:32.260 line:15%
I will get my things and begin immediately.

4940
03:14:32.260 --> 03:14:34.180 line:15%
Do we have, we have a, we have quarters for that,

4941
03:14:34.180 --> 03:14:35.480 line:15%
right?
Pleasure to meet you.

4942
03:14:35.480 --> 03:14:37.660 line:15%
Yeah, there's an extra room.

4943
03:14:37.660 --> 03:14:39.200 line:15%
That makes life easier.
What was her name again?

4944
03:14:39.200 --> 03:14:40.430 line:15%
You know what?
No really,

4945
03:14:40.430 --> 03:14:41.660 line:15%
what was your name?
I don't remember--

4946
03:14:41.660 --> 03:14:42.570 line:15%
Vendetta.
And I'm not sure

4947
03:14:42.570 --> 03:14:44.650 line:15%
that Matt does either.
I literally said it

4948
03:14:44.650 --> 03:14:45.760 line:15%
on the spot and forgot to write it down,

4949
03:14:45.760 --> 03:14:47.830 line:15%
not so much help on that.
Vendetta, it's Vendetta.

4950
03:14:47.830 --> 03:14:50.820 line:15%
You know what, we'll ask her when she gets back.

4951
03:14:50.820 --> 03:14:52.342 line:15%
I can't ask her--
We'll ask again later.

4952
03:14:52.342 --> 03:14:54.050 line:15%
What was it?
I think it's

4953
03:14:54.050 --> 03:14:55.507 line:15%
Vidalla or something, I should've--

4954
03:14:55.507 --> 03:14:56.930 line:15%
Internet--
I'm usually good

4955
03:14:56.930 --> 03:14:58.580 line:15%
about writing it down and I'll find it out tomorrow.

4956
03:14:58.580 --> 03:15:00.660 line:15%
I can't ask her 'cause she'll know I didn't remember,

4957
03:15:00.660 --> 03:15:02.260 line:15%
so one of you ask her, all right?

4958
03:15:02.260 --> 03:15:03.350 line:15%
Vidalla.
Vidalla.

4959
03:15:03.350 --> 03:15:04.850 line:15%
All right, so I wasn't too far off.

4960
03:15:05.800 --> 03:15:08.930 line:15%
No one selfs-name themselves Vendetta.

4961
03:15:08.930 --> 03:15:11.530 line:15%
Vidalla.
Without its use.

4962
03:15:11.530 --> 03:15:14.660 line:15%
Yay, we have somebody working for us.

4963
03:15:14.660 --> 03:15:17.740 line:15%
That's pretty cool.
You're welcome.

4964
03:15:17.740 --> 03:15:18.640 line:15%
Nicely done.
That was

4965
03:15:18.640 --> 03:15:21.080 line:15%
a really high price, though, because, you know,

4966
03:15:21.080 --> 03:15:24.400 line:15%
we have people that clean up my mom's quarters and stuff

4967
03:15:24.400 --> 03:15:27.260 line:15%
and they cost way less than that.

4968
03:15:27.260 --> 03:15:28.380 line:15%
Well--
I think.

4969
03:15:30.849 --> 03:15:33.490 line:15%
(laughs) I mean, doesn't matter to me.

4970
03:15:33.490 --> 03:15:35.630 line:15%
'Cause we're all splitting it, so.

4971
03:15:35.630 --> 03:15:38.190 line:15%
No, no we're not, that's okay.

4972
03:15:38.190 --> 03:15:39.830 line:15%
Yeah, we can split it if you want.

4973
03:15:39.830 --> 03:15:41.600 line:15%
Oh yes, Essek?

4974
03:15:41.600 --> 03:15:42.750 line:15%
Oh, we'll be right there.

4975
03:15:42.750 --> 03:15:44.050 line:15%
It's quite urgent that we get to his place.

4976
03:15:44.050 --> 03:15:44.883 line:15%
He's messaging you?

4977
03:15:44.883 --> 03:15:46.890 line:15%
All right, let's go.
Yeah.

4978
03:15:46.890 --> 03:15:48.303 line:15%
All right.

4979
03:15:48.303 --> 03:15:50.553 line:15%
(laughing)

4980
03:15:55.370 --> 03:15:56.410 line:15%
You head your way over toward

4981
03:15:56.410 --> 03:15:58.920 line:15%
Essek's home after finishing up here.

4982
03:16:00.030 --> 03:16:02.880 line:15%
You head to his familiar towers where you had

4983
03:16:02.880 --> 03:16:06.540 line:15%
previously enjoyed the cheese and crackers provided to you.

4984
03:16:08.030 --> 03:16:09.120 line:15%
You're greeted by Essek, who leads you

4985
03:16:09.120 --> 03:16:11.010 line:15%
back into the interior.

4986
03:16:11.010 --> 03:16:14.380 line:15%
"Well, I was not expecting you to return to Rosohna so soon.

4987
03:16:14.380 --> 03:16:16.460 line:15%
"I take it your journey was successful?"

4988
03:16:17.630 --> 03:16:19.190 line:15%
Yeah.
We believe so, yes.

4989
03:16:19.190 --> 03:16:21.950 line:15%
Should we try the spell again before we go?

4990
03:16:21.950 --> 03:16:24.520 line:15%
I mean, I haven't even really meditated about it yet.

4991
03:16:24.520 --> 03:16:26.280 line:15%
Oh, you're right, okay.

4992
03:16:27.760 --> 03:16:31.050 line:15%
Well, you said you needed to travel somewhere, so.

4993
03:16:32.080 --> 03:16:36.170 line:15%
Yes, is it okay?
Yes, it's okay.

4994
03:16:36.170 --> 03:16:38.270 line:15%
I, (chuckles) you know,

4995
03:16:40.368 --> 03:16:42.480 line:15%
it prevents me from some of

4996
03:16:42.480 --> 03:16:46.440 line:15%
my capabilities throughout the day each time I do this,

4997
03:16:46.440 --> 03:16:49.700 line:15%
so while I'm here in my home and things are

4998
03:16:49.700 --> 03:16:53.290 line:15%
not requiring me to be elsewhere rapidly,

4999
03:16:53.290 --> 03:16:55.230 line:15%
thankfully this is a moment in time

5000
03:16:55.230 --> 03:16:59.330 line:15%
in which I am more useful here in the city.

5001
03:17:00.230 --> 03:17:01.810 line:15%
But?
It's greatly appreciated.

5002
03:17:04.100 --> 03:17:08.560 line:15%
I'm sure we'll find a way to balance the scales some time.

5003
03:17:08.560 --> 03:17:10.290 line:15%
Is there any news on your end?

5004
03:17:12.010 --> 03:17:17.000 line:15%
What I know is many of the (sighs) many of the

5005
03:17:17.000 --> 03:17:20.260 line:15%
elements of the military on both sides are holding

5006
03:17:20.260 --> 03:17:25.260 line:15%
hard lines at the exterior of previous battlefields.

5007
03:17:26.460 --> 03:17:28.920 line:15%
There has been some small scale negotiation

5008
03:17:28.920 --> 03:17:32.170 line:15%
and discussion as far as preparation for this gathering.

5009
03:17:32.170 --> 03:17:34.640 line:15%
Ships have already set out with

5010
03:17:34.640 --> 03:17:38.420 line:15%
the prisoner from one of our outposts.

5011
03:17:38.420 --> 03:17:42.940 line:15%
It is quite a long trek from our side of one end here.

5012
03:17:44.941 --> 03:17:47.360 line:15%
I believe the same has begun traveling from

5013
03:17:47.360 --> 03:17:51.240 line:15%
the Dwendalian Empire to eventually

5014
03:17:51.240 --> 03:17:53.240 line:15%
find its way toward the Menagerie Coast.

5015
03:17:54.200 --> 03:17:56.940 line:15%
Are we going to miss the negotiation?

5016
03:17:56.940 --> 03:17:58.880 line:15%
It takes weeks.
The negotiation is about

5017
03:17:58.880 --> 03:18:00.570 line:15%
three, three and a half weeks from now,

5018
03:18:00.570 --> 03:18:01.880 line:15%
I believe.
Okay.

5019
03:18:01.880 --> 03:18:04.590 line:15%
So, as long as you can ensure your return by then.

5020
03:18:06.080 --> 03:18:08.180 line:15%
Otherwise, it'll just have to continue without you.

5021
03:18:08.180 --> 03:18:09.885 line:15%
Wow, okay.
It's that

5022
03:18:09.885 --> 03:18:13.786 line:15%
and then Traveler Con is days later?

5023
03:18:13.786 --> 03:18:16.750 line:15%
Yeah.
It's pretty rapidly after.

5024
03:18:17.810 --> 03:18:19.380 line:15%
We'll be close.
That's less than a week

5025
03:18:19.380 --> 03:18:21.390 line:15%
after where the negotiation is set

5026
03:18:21.390 --> 03:18:22.950 line:15%
is when Traveler Con's probably gonna happen, so.

5027
03:18:22.950 --> 03:18:26.370 line:15%
And the volcano's out in the water, too.

5028
03:18:26.370 --> 03:18:27.300 line:15%
So, where would you like me

5029
03:18:27.300 --> 03:18:28.840 line:15%
to take you?
Caduceus?

5030
03:18:30.010 --> 03:18:33.430 line:15%
Oh, we're going to--
The menagerie.

5031
03:18:33.430 --> 03:18:34.770 line:15%
Yeah--
It's a vast space, yes?

5032
03:18:34.770 --> 03:18:36.770 line:15%
So, somewhere more specific?
Can you describe

5033
03:18:36.770 --> 03:18:39.550 line:15%
exactly where we're going?
No, I've never been there.

5034
03:18:39.550 --> 03:18:41.370 line:15%
Oh.
Didn't you say

5035
03:18:41.370 --> 03:18:42.590 line:15%
it was near the forest that we

5036
03:18:42.590 --> 03:18:43.890 line:15%
have been to?
No.

5037
03:18:44.930 --> 03:18:48.220 line:15%
Do you not know where I'm supposed to be taking you?

5038
03:18:48.220 --> 03:18:49.610 line:15%
That is--
Where's the map--

5039
03:18:49.610 --> 03:18:51.270 line:15%
That is impossible.
No, we know,

5040
03:18:51.270 --> 03:18:53.807 line:15%
we know where we're going.
I know the name of it.

5041
03:18:53.807 --> 03:18:55.610 line:15%
It was the high, it was the forest down,

5042
03:18:55.610 --> 03:18:57.706 line:15%
that's the wrong map.
Wrong map.

5043
03:18:57.706 --> 03:18:59.250 line:15%
(paper rustling)

5044
03:18:59.250 --> 03:19:01.110 line:15%
Is it this one?
Nope.

5045
03:19:01.110 --> 03:19:02.980 line:15%
We need Xhorhas.
We have so many maps.

5046
03:19:02.980 --> 03:19:05.440 line:15%
It's right there, it's right there, it's right there.

5047
03:19:07.370 --> 03:19:08.323 line:15%
(thumping)

5048
03:19:08.323 --> 03:19:09.823 line:15%
Get out the map.

5049
03:19:10.813 --> 03:19:12.490 line:15%
It was this one?
Thank you.

5050
03:19:12.490 --> 03:19:15.080 line:15%
Yeah, it's, yeah, it's over here.

5051
03:19:15.080 --> 03:19:16.730 line:15%
Down here.

5052
03:19:16.730 --> 03:19:18.900 line:15%
Uh, Whitedawn Lagoon, if I recall.

5053
03:19:18.900 --> 03:19:21.100 line:15%
Is that where we're--
Whitedawn Lagoon, right.

5054
03:19:21.100 --> 03:19:25.570 line:15%
Okay, I've not been there, but I know of its existence,

5055
03:19:25.570 --> 03:19:30.220 line:15%
that puts us in a possible chance of arriving.

5056
03:19:32.950 --> 03:19:35.880 line:15%
Are we gambling with fate by going--

5057
03:19:35.880 --> 03:19:38.410 line:15%
Should I scry on the Whitedawn Lagoon?

5058
03:19:38.410 --> 03:19:40.450 line:15%
Can I scry, I can't scry on a location.

5059
03:19:40.450 --> 03:19:41.500 line:15%
I always forget this.

5060
03:19:42.980 --> 03:19:45.670 line:15%
I don't have it prepared anyway.

5061
03:19:45.670 --> 03:19:49.000 line:15%
I don't have it prepared either, so I could not,

5062
03:19:49.000 --> 03:19:51.070 line:15%
it would be helpful to me to do so.

5063
03:19:51.070 --> 03:19:53.600 line:15%
Which means we can either go now and chance it

5064
03:19:53.600 --> 03:19:55.830 line:15%
or we can try tomorrow.
Let's chance it.

5065
03:19:55.830 --> 03:19:57.730 line:15%
Chance it.
Chance it.

5066
03:19:57.730 --> 03:20:00.064 line:15%
What's life without a little risk?

5067
03:20:00.064 --> 03:20:01.170 line:15%
So much can go wrong with this.

5068
03:20:01.170 --> 03:20:03.120 line:15%
Of course, but so much can go wrong with all sorts of--

5069
03:20:03.120 --> 03:20:04.890 line:15%
That's so true.
Elements of magic.

5070
03:20:04.890 --> 03:20:07.540 line:15%
Exciting, though, as we've experienced together

5071
03:20:07.540 --> 03:20:10.180 line:15%
once before, sometimes painful.

5072
03:20:11.680 --> 03:20:14.500 line:15%
Mmhm.
But if you insist.

5073
03:20:14.500 --> 03:20:15.360 line:15%
Let us all take hands,

5074
03:20:15.360 --> 03:20:16.950 line:15%
if you are ready.
Oh boy.

5075
03:20:18.560 --> 03:20:23.050 line:15%
Just for fun, I'm going to make a prayer for everything

5076
03:20:23.050 --> 03:20:25.590 line:15%
to go well.
Oh.

5077
03:20:26.798 --> 03:20:28.667 line:15%
(dice clattering)

5078
03:20:28.667 --> 03:20:29.500 line:15%
Nope.

5079
03:20:29.500 --> 03:20:31.750 line:15%
(laughing)

5080
03:20:33.026 --> 03:20:36.353 line:15%
The Wildmother is silent.
I'm going to--

5081
03:20:36.353 --> 03:20:37.879 line:15%
It was a long shot.

5082
03:20:37.879 --> 03:20:38.799 line:15%
(laughing)

5083
03:20:38.799 --> 03:20:41.780 line:15%
Put my hands on Essek's shoulder and I'm gonna say,

5084
03:20:41.780 --> 03:20:43.630 line:15%
"The Traveler is with you, my child."

5085
03:20:46.630 --> 03:20:49.080 line:15%
Thank you, Jester.
Yeah.

5086
03:20:51.497 --> 03:20:52.330 line:15%
Come, come.

5087
03:20:52.330 --> 03:20:53.420 line:15%
And he kind of glides over into

5088
03:20:53.420 --> 03:20:57.700 line:15%
the center of his main chamber.

5089
03:20:58.610 --> 03:20:59.840 line:15%
You watch as he kind of moves that way,

5090
03:20:59.840 --> 03:21:02.550 line:15%
the furniture (imitates scraping furniture) kinda scoots

5091
03:21:02.550 --> 03:21:05.940 line:15%
on its own to the sides and leaves the open space.

5092
03:21:05.940 --> 03:21:08.960 line:15%
Puts his hands out.

5093
03:21:08.960 --> 03:21:12.260 line:15%
You all clasp hands and he goes, "Whitedawn Lagoon.

5094
03:21:14.460 --> 03:21:16.170 line:15%
"Fingers crossed."

5095
03:21:16.170 --> 03:21:19.410 line:15%
(whispers) And as he begins to finish incantations,

5096
03:21:19.410 --> 03:21:22.760 line:15%
you can hear the voice echos growing louder and louder.

5097
03:21:22.760 --> 03:21:24.360 line:15%
You can see on the ground between your feet

5098
03:21:24.360 --> 03:21:27.284 line:15%
these little kind of light gray lines begin to

5099
03:21:27.284 --> 03:21:29.930 line:15%
(makes whooshing noises) connect you all in the center.

5100
03:21:29.930 --> 03:21:31.270 line:15%
As it grows brighter and brighter and then

5101
03:21:31.270 --> 03:21:32.980 line:15%
foof, you feel that familiar sound of

5102
03:21:32.980 --> 03:21:36.820 line:15%
you all being pulled into nothingness.

5103
03:21:36.820 --> 03:21:39.460 line:15%
I need somebody to roll a D100 for me.

5104
03:21:40.400 --> 03:21:42.000 line:15%
Taliesen--
Tal do it, yeah.

5105
03:21:44.043 --> 03:21:44.900 line:15%
(dice clattering)

5106
03:21:44.900 --> 03:21:46.300 line:15%
Ho.
That's

5107
03:21:47.750 --> 03:21:49.280 line:15%
99.

5108
03:21:49.280 --> 03:21:50.113 line:15%
Whoa.
It is?

5109
03:21:50.113 --> 03:21:51.870 line:15%
Is that good or bad?
Yeah, it's 99.

5110
03:21:51.870 --> 03:21:53.970 line:15%
I don't know.
Hold on.

5111
03:21:53.970 --> 03:21:55.610 line:15%
I'm trying to--
It's hard to read--

5112
03:21:55.610 --> 03:21:57.780 line:15%
Divine Inspiration, that woulda been amazing.

5113
03:21:57.780 --> 03:21:59.010 line:15%
Yeah.
That woulda been--

5114
03:21:59.010 --> 03:22:01.707 line:15%
If I rolled that last time, that woulda been crazy.

5115
03:22:01.707 --> 03:22:03.815 line:15%
(chuckling)

5116
03:22:03.815 --> 03:22:06.030 line:15%
Mercer's early page turning is interesting.

5117
03:22:06.030 --> 03:22:07.810 line:15%
Think that's--
I throw 11?

5118
03:22:07.810 --> 03:22:09.480 line:15%
Yeah.
Super bad.

5119
03:22:09.480 --> 03:22:11.760 line:15%
Not good.
Not good, that's not good?

5120
03:22:11.760 --> 03:22:13.725 line:15%
No, actually, it's really good.

5121
03:22:13.725 --> 03:22:15.351 line:15%
Okay.
So, it's really good?

5122
03:22:15.351 --> 03:22:16.184 line:15%
That is on target.
Oh.

5123
03:22:16.184 --> 03:22:17.017 line:15%
Oh wow.
That's super duper

5124
03:22:17.017 --> 03:22:18.471 line:15%
on target, right?
One way or the other.

5125
03:22:18.471 --> 03:22:22.906 line:15%
You had a 25% of this succeeding. (laughs)

5126
03:22:22.906 --> 03:22:24.853 line:15%
(surprised murmuring)

5127
03:22:24.853 --> 03:22:25.790 line:15%
'Cause this is only based on a description,

5128
03:22:25.790 --> 03:22:26.940 line:15%
he's not even viewed it before.

5129
03:22:26.940 --> 03:22:29.330 line:15%
Oh geez louise.
There's a 43% chance

5130
03:22:29.330 --> 03:22:32.310 line:15%
for a mishap on that one, but you rolled a 99.

5131
03:22:32.310 --> 03:22:33.300 line:15%
I rolled a, look at that,

5132
03:22:33.300 --> 03:22:34.470 line:15%
that's really pretty.
Yeah, that's really good.

5133
03:22:34.470 --> 03:22:36.302 line:15%
Those are the dice you got me,

5134
03:22:36.302 --> 03:22:37.885 line:15%
by the way--
Yeah.

5135
03:22:39.355 --> 03:22:40.188 line:15%
They've been good dice.
Good.

5136
03:22:40.188 --> 03:22:42.070 line:15%
They've been really good.
So,

5137
03:22:44.160 --> 03:22:47.750 line:15%
voof, you all suddenly go from the cold night

5138
03:22:47.750 --> 03:22:51.400 line:15%
to the bright midday sun of a bluer sky above.

5139
03:22:51.400 --> 03:22:52.920 line:15%
You can see most of the clouds that

5140
03:22:52.920 --> 03:22:55.800 line:15%
you're used to seeing in the Dwendalian Empire not there,

5141
03:22:55.800 --> 03:22:59.030 line:15%
aside from a few small plumes of white across the horizon.

5142
03:22:59.030 --> 03:23:02.240 line:15%
You are partially looking out to what looks to be

5143
03:23:02.240 --> 03:23:07.240 line:15%
a green kind of grassy stretch of hill that then

5144
03:23:08.818 --> 03:23:12.250 line:15%
vanishes before you see ocean to the South,

5145
03:23:13.160 --> 03:23:15.570 line:15%
the glittering waters of the Lucidian Ocean.

5146
03:23:17.310 --> 03:23:20.110 line:15%
You kind of look to your right and behind you

5147
03:23:20.110 --> 03:23:22.230 line:15%
and you can see the elements of a mountain range

5148
03:23:22.230 --> 03:23:26.420 line:15%
that vanish to the North, broken gray rocks

5149
03:23:26.420 --> 03:23:29.260 line:15%
and it looks like a deep ravine that begins to

5150
03:23:29.260 --> 03:23:32.650 line:15%
carve its way Northward from where you stand.

5151
03:23:32.650 --> 03:23:33.970 line:15%
It's a number of miles away,

5152
03:23:33.970 --> 03:23:36.400 line:15%
it's barely visible on the horizon.

5153
03:23:36.400 --> 03:23:41.400 line:15%
But immediately before you, you can see this vast jungle,

5154
03:23:43.470 --> 03:23:48.380 line:15%
this dense tropical forest that seems to wrap around

5155
03:23:48.380 --> 03:23:50.150 line:15%
and encompass a large portion

5156
03:23:50.150 --> 03:23:54.744 line:15%
of this shore-side cliff expanse.

5157
03:23:54.744 --> 03:23:57.540 line:15%
(gentle music)

5158
03:23:57.540 --> 03:23:59.790 line:15%
You assume that you're probably pretty close to

5159
03:23:59.790 --> 03:24:03.080 line:15%
or right at the area known as the Whitedawn Lagoon.

5160
03:24:04.820 --> 03:24:06.270 line:15%
Essek immediately goes, "Ahh.

5161
03:24:08.120 --> 03:24:10.220 line:15%
"Ah, I think this was a success."

5162
03:24:10.220 --> 03:24:11.960 line:15%
This looks about right.

5163
03:24:11.960 --> 03:24:14.190 line:15%
When was the last time you saw the sun?

5164
03:24:14.190 --> 03:24:18.500 line:15%
It's been a number of, I think probably since

5165
03:24:18.500 --> 03:24:21.570 line:15%
the last time I took you somewhere this bright.

5166
03:24:21.570 --> 03:24:22.990 line:15%
Does it hurt you?

5167
03:24:22.990 --> 03:24:27.610 line:15%
It's not comfortable, but it is tolerable.

5168
03:24:30.716 --> 03:24:32.090 line:15%
Is this what you were seeking?

5169
03:24:33.630 --> 03:24:36.430 line:15%
Does this mountain range look familiar from my vision?

5170
03:24:37.730 --> 03:24:39.770 line:15%
The mountain range itself isn't familiar to you,

5171
03:24:39.770 --> 03:24:41.890 line:15%
but the visions you've had definitely,

5172
03:24:41.890 --> 03:24:46.890 line:15%
your visions specifically are of an oasis

5173
03:24:46.940 --> 03:24:48.700 line:15%
in the middle of a jungle.
Sure.

5174
03:24:48.700 --> 03:24:50.830 line:15%
You don't know which one or where.

5175
03:24:50.830 --> 03:24:53.320 line:15%
And so, none of this is familiar to you,

5176
03:24:53.320 --> 03:24:55.480 line:15%
but you seem to have been brought to where you requested.

5177
03:24:55.480 --> 03:24:59.290 line:15%
I get down on the ground and paint a parasol

5178
03:24:59.290 --> 03:25:01.362 line:15%
and pop it out and go, foonk.

5179
03:25:01.362 --> 03:25:03.612 line:15%
(laughing)

5180
03:25:05.970 --> 03:25:08.253 line:15%
Thank you, Jester.
You're welcome.

5181
03:25:08.253 --> 03:25:09.703 line:15%
He's so cute with his parasol.

5182
03:25:09.703 --> 03:25:11.735 line:15%
I'm going to--
There's dicks--

5183
03:25:11.735 --> 03:25:15.302 line:15%
(laughing)
(talking over each other)

5184
03:25:15.302 --> 03:25:16.949 line:15%
He's Mary Poppins, y'all!

5185
03:25:16.949 --> 03:25:19.199 line:15%
(laughing)

5186
03:25:20.109 --> 03:25:21.860 line:15%
I'm going to sit down, send out a little,

5187
03:25:21.860 --> 03:25:23.830 line:15%
I'm going to face the mountains.

5188
03:25:23.830 --> 03:25:25.570 line:15%
There's a jungle, I assume, in front of us,

5189
03:25:25.570 --> 03:25:26.420 line:15%
towards--
Yes.

5190
03:25:27.330 --> 03:25:28.919 line:15%
(gentle music)

5191
03:25:28.919 --> 03:25:30.391 line:15%
(throat clearing

5192
03:25:30.391 --> 03:25:33.280 line:15%
And

5193
03:25:33.280 --> 03:25:35.434 line:15%
I'm going to cast

5194
03:25:35.434 --> 03:25:38.450 line:15%
(pages flipping)

5195
03:25:38.450 --> 03:25:40.029 line:15%
Commune.

5196
03:25:40.029 --> 03:25:42.600 line:15%
(pages flipping)

5197
03:25:42.600 --> 03:25:44.450 line:15%
Okay.
I'll sit down

5198
03:25:44.450 --> 03:25:47.150 line:15%
off and to his right, behind him.

5199
03:25:48.380 --> 03:25:52.220 line:15%
Okay, kind of lend your presence to the commune as well?

5200
03:25:52.220 --> 03:25:54.135 line:15%
Mmhm.
You've got it.

5201
03:25:54.135 --> 03:25:56.718 line:15%
(gentle music)

5202
03:26:00.040 --> 03:26:01.840 line:15%
Does my destination lie before me?

5203
03:26:03.130 --> 03:26:05.900 line:15%
As you kind of focus, all of you feel

5204
03:26:05.900 --> 03:26:10.900 line:15%
the still air become a warm seaside breeze,

5205
03:26:11.720 --> 03:26:14.630 line:15%
a welcome shift from the colder climates

5206
03:26:14.630 --> 03:26:16.620 line:15%
which you've traversed as of late,

5207
03:26:16.620 --> 03:26:18.930 line:15%
and familiar to those who grew up in the Menagerie Coast.

5208
03:26:18.930 --> 03:26:22.770 line:15%
This further South on Xhorhas definitely resembles

5209
03:26:22.770 --> 03:26:24.420 line:15%
the places where you two grew up.

5210
03:26:26.010 --> 03:26:29.180 line:15%
As the warm wind kinda blows through, (blows)

5211
03:26:30.140 --> 03:26:33.600 line:15%
you get a sweet smell, a familiar smell,

5212
03:26:35.020 --> 03:26:39.800 line:15%
this kind of sweet, honeysuckle-like flower aroma

5213
03:26:41.150 --> 03:26:43.180 line:15%
that reminds you of times in your youth

5214
03:26:43.180 --> 03:26:44.770 line:15%
when you were on the right path

5215
03:26:45.930 --> 03:26:49.830 line:15%
and the wind blows in the direction of the jungle

5216
03:26:49.830 --> 03:26:54.680 line:15%
in front of you, the trees the swaying inward. (blows)

5217
03:26:59.370 --> 03:27:00.720 line:15%
Is it under a day's walk?

5218
03:27:02.630 --> 03:27:07.630 line:15%
The breeze comes to a still, still blowing but gentler.

5219
03:27:08.080 --> 03:27:10.660 line:15%
You get the sense that the answer is inconclusive.

5220
03:27:12.010 --> 03:27:15.870 line:15%
Is it dangerous?
The breeze picks up

5221
03:27:15.870 --> 03:27:18.400 line:15%
once more but is rapidly cold,

5222
03:27:18.400 --> 03:27:19.840 line:15%
not in a way that it denies it but

5223
03:27:19.840 --> 03:27:22.289 line:15%
definitely confirms that there is danger ahead.

5224
03:27:22.289 --> 03:27:25.648 line:15%
(gentle music)

5225
03:27:25.648 --> 03:27:26.916 line:15%
(inhaling)

5226
03:27:26.916 --> 03:27:29.990 line:15%
(gentle music)

5227
03:27:29.990 --> 03:27:33.570 line:15%
About a day's journey, it is dangerous,

5228
03:27:37.430 --> 03:27:41.840 line:15%
but we head this way.
Lead the way.

5229
03:27:41.840 --> 03:27:42.770 line:15%
Okey dokey.

5230
03:27:42.770 --> 03:27:44.830 line:15%
Do you know what we're looking for?

5231
03:27:44.830 --> 03:27:46.850 line:15%
A house, a hill, a grove?

5232
03:27:47.810 --> 03:27:49.500 line:15%
An oasis.
An oasis.

5233
03:27:52.030 --> 03:27:54.170 line:15%
Are we walkin' along the beach or--

5234
03:27:54.170 --> 03:27:55.640 line:15%
No, we're walking into the jungle.

5235
03:27:55.640 --> 03:27:57.330 line:15%
Great.
Hm.

5236
03:27:57.330 --> 03:28:01.530 line:15%
You can hear the various jungle birds and wildlife

5237
03:28:01.530 --> 03:28:06.530 line:15%
giving off loud caws and crows and distant insects chirping.

5238
03:28:08.210 --> 03:28:11.060 line:15%
It's a wild, tangled space.

5239
03:28:11.060 --> 03:28:13.640 line:15%
Essek goes, "Well, that is not for me.

5240
03:28:15.640 --> 03:28:17.610 line:15%
"Thank you, Jester, and good luck."

5241
03:28:20.990 --> 03:28:24.510 line:15%
And kind of glides over and lands down into a patch of sand

5242
03:28:24.510 --> 03:28:26.310 line:15%
and begins to take his finger and carve out

5243
03:28:26.310 --> 03:28:28.570 line:15%
what looks to be a teleportation circle.

5244
03:28:28.570 --> 03:28:30.070 line:15%
Thank you, friend.
Thank you.

5245
03:28:30.070 --> 03:28:30.903 line:15%
Of course.

5246
03:28:33.280 --> 03:28:35.266 line:15%
Continues his work.
Spitball.

5247
03:28:35.266 --> 03:28:36.370 line:15%
(laughing)

5248
03:28:36.370 --> 03:28:37.279 line:15%
(gagging)

5249
03:28:37.279 --> 03:28:39.690 line:15%
(laughing)

5250
03:28:39.690 --> 03:28:44.550 line:15%
The jungle awaits you.
Okay, shall we?

5251
03:28:44.550 --> 03:28:45.640 line:15%
Thank you for this.

5252
03:28:45.640 --> 03:28:48.350 line:15%
You don't teleport to a place like this,

5253
03:28:48.350 --> 03:28:51.360 line:15%
you have to make it there.

5254
03:28:53.070 --> 03:28:54.570 line:15%
Are we cheating in some way?

5255
03:28:55.840 --> 03:28:58.240 line:15%
This is as close as I was comfortable getting.

5256
03:29:00.250 --> 03:29:01.900 line:15%
Now we make it.
Now we walk.

5257
03:29:02.830 --> 03:29:03.663 line:15%
Okay.

5258
03:29:05.030 --> 03:29:05.863 line:15%
All right.

5259
03:29:09.604 --> 03:29:12.229 line:15%
You guys--

5260
03:29:12.229 --> 03:29:13.903 line:15%
Mm hm.

5261
03:29:13.903 --> 03:29:18.020 line:15%
Begin to trek your initial steps into this jungle,

5262
03:29:19.970 --> 03:29:24.610 line:15%
stepping over heavy thick base roots,

5263
03:29:24.610 --> 03:29:27.650 line:15%
pushing past all manner of flora and fauna,

5264
03:29:28.500 --> 03:29:31.720 line:15%
heavy ferns that rise up to maybe five, six feet,

5265
03:29:31.720 --> 03:29:33.740 line:15%
some even taller the further in you get.

5266
03:29:34.740 --> 03:29:36.380 line:15%
The path that you trek is not a path,

5267
03:29:36.380 --> 03:29:38.500 line:15%
there is no walked path in this area,

5268
03:29:38.500 --> 03:29:42.470 line:15%
you're having to climb over and carve

5269
03:29:42.470 --> 03:29:46.310 line:15%
probably the first steps from this point of entry

5270
03:29:46.310 --> 03:29:49.180 line:15%
that have made their way from any journeyman.

5271
03:29:49.180 --> 03:29:53.200 line:15%
I'm going to try and let as much flora, fauna,

5272
03:29:53.200 --> 03:29:55.310 line:15%
and animal life know why we're here and what we're

5273
03:29:55.310 --> 03:29:58.330 line:15%
looking for and that we're just passing through,

5274
03:29:58.330 --> 03:30:00.400 line:15%
heading to the oasis.
All right.

5275
03:30:01.420 --> 03:30:04.300 line:15%
The air itself is very warm, which is comforting,

5276
03:30:04.300 --> 03:30:06.170 line:15%
especially given the last night that you spent

5277
03:30:06.170 --> 03:30:09.330 line:15%
in the chilly mountains on the

5278
03:30:09.330 --> 03:30:11.480 line:15%
Northern side of the Cyrios mountain range.

5279
03:30:13.690 --> 03:30:16.780 line:15%
Numerous heavy vines wrap around

5280
03:30:16.780 --> 03:30:20.090 line:15%
the thick, thick tree trunks, a number of which

5281
03:30:20.090 --> 03:30:22.530 line:15%
begin to wrap and cluster in front of you,

5282
03:30:22.530 --> 03:30:24.520 line:15%
forming small barriers that you kind of have to

5283
03:30:24.520 --> 03:30:27.370 line:15%
hack through and push your way around.

5284
03:30:27.370 --> 03:30:31.090 line:15%
You find small nests of insects and other

5285
03:30:31.090 --> 03:30:35.010 line:15%
small woodland creatures built along bases and upward.

5286
03:30:35.010 --> 03:30:37.570 line:15%
Some of these trees, sorta like banyan tree-type,

5287
03:30:37.570 --> 03:30:41.000 line:15%
these thick, squat trees with these heavy, heavy

5288
03:30:41.000 --> 03:30:43.070 line:15%
just dozens and dozens of thick branches

5289
03:30:43.070 --> 03:30:44.580 line:15%
that build up into the large canopy,

5290
03:30:44.580 --> 03:30:47.070 line:15%
each one kind of knotting and tangling with the next,

5291
03:30:47.070 --> 03:30:50.270 line:15%
forming this network with occasional breaks

5292
03:30:50.270 --> 03:30:53.890 line:15%
where you can see the dust and pollen and other sorts of

5293
03:30:55.170 --> 03:31:00.170 line:15%
various nature-based clouding material

5294
03:31:00.790 --> 03:31:04.920 line:15%
that drift through and elements of light peek in beams

5295
03:31:04.920 --> 03:31:06.710 line:15%
that begin to greet you as you

5296
03:31:06.710 --> 03:31:08.730 line:15%
push from one barrier to the next.

5297
03:31:09.710 --> 03:31:11.600 line:15%
The smell and the scent is

5298
03:31:11.600 --> 03:31:15.160 line:15%
profoundly comforting, though odd.

5299
03:31:15.160 --> 03:31:20.160 line:15%
It is nature in a way that is full of life.

5300
03:31:20.180 --> 03:31:22.840 line:15%
It's sweet, similar to the smell that

5301
03:31:22.840 --> 03:31:24.390 line:15%
came with the breeze of your commune

5302
03:31:24.390 --> 03:31:26.800 line:15%
but more varied and diverse in the way that

5303
03:31:26.800 --> 03:31:29.570 line:15%
it affects the memories that come to mind

5304
03:31:29.570 --> 03:31:32.120 line:15%
that are connected to some of these kind of smells.

5305
03:31:34.300 --> 03:31:36.610 line:15%
Who's keeping watch as you progress into this?

5306
03:31:36.610 --> 03:31:39.020 line:15%
What is the marching order?
Oh jeez.

5307
03:31:39.020 --> 03:31:40.260 line:15%
I'm assuming you're in front--
I'm in front, I guess.

5308
03:31:40.260 --> 03:31:42.050 line:15%
Caduceus is the leader, yeah.

5309
03:31:42.050 --> 03:31:43.800 line:15%
I'll be behind Caduceus.

5310
03:31:44.740 --> 03:31:46.410 line:15%
I'll pull up the rear, maybe.

5311
03:31:46.410 --> 03:31:47.981 line:15%
I'll go behind Fjord.

5312
03:31:47.981 --> 03:31:49.500 line:15%
I'll take the center of the line if--

5313
03:31:49.500 --> 03:31:52.020 line:15%
I'll go behind Yasha.
I'll protect Caleb and Nott.

5314
03:31:52.020 --> 03:31:53.020 line:15%
Fjord, you're behind Caduceus?

5315
03:31:53.020 --> 03:31:55.710 line:15%
Fjord and Yasha with swords, slicing through.

5316
03:31:55.710 --> 03:31:57.250 line:15%
Yup.
All right, so you're,

5317
03:31:57.250 --> 03:31:58.750 line:15%
so Fjord and Yasha up there, right there.

5318
03:31:58.750 --> 03:32:00.900 line:15%
How hot is it, by the way?

5319
03:32:00.900 --> 03:32:03.120 line:15%
Down here, I'd say it's probably,

5320
03:32:03.120 --> 03:32:05.870 line:15%
it's not terribly hot, it's mid-80s.

5321
03:32:05.870 --> 03:32:07.310 line:15%
Oof, I definitely take off my

5322
03:32:07.310 --> 03:32:08.540 line:15%
overcoat--
Coats off, for sure.

5323
03:32:08.540 --> 03:32:09.890 line:15%
Yeah.
Holy moly.

5324
03:32:09.890 --> 03:32:11.730 line:15%
Yeah, so it's not terribly hot,

5325
03:32:12.970 --> 03:32:16.120 line:15%
but given the amount of things you have on

5326
03:32:16.120 --> 03:32:18.080 line:15%
and the sense of the clothing you've been

5327
03:32:18.080 --> 03:32:19.600 line:15%
wearing for different climates,

5328
03:32:19.600 --> 03:32:21.450 line:15%
you're immediately starting to sweat.

5329
03:32:22.382 --> 03:32:23.215 line:15%
We'll take off--
So Beauregard,

5330
03:32:23.215 --> 03:32:25.640 line:15%
you're here in the middle with Caleb, you said?

5331
03:32:25.640 --> 03:32:28.820 line:15%
Yeah, I'll be directly behind Caleb and Nott, I think,

5332
03:32:28.820 --> 03:32:30.960 line:15%
next to Jester.
Okay, there you go.

5333
03:32:31.900 --> 03:32:35.100 line:15%
Caleb's hair is gettin' really long, so he puts it up.

5334
03:32:35.100 --> 03:32:37.100 line:15%
You gotta kinda--
Topknot or a little

5335
03:32:37.100 --> 03:32:38.470 line:15%
ponytail?
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

5336
03:32:38.470 --> 03:32:42.080 line:15%
Or the little half, the little halfer?

5337
03:32:42.080 --> 03:32:44.350 line:15%
No, full ponytail.
Full pony?

5338
03:32:44.350 --> 03:32:45.903 line:15%
Yeah.
Mm, that's good.

5339
03:32:45.903 --> 03:32:48.970 line:15%
Rolled up the sleeves.
All right, so.

5340
03:32:49.900 --> 03:32:52.042 line:15%
Halfer--
You just tie it in a knot?

5341
03:32:52.042 --> 03:32:55.020 line:15%
Yeah, just have this ribbon, you just kinda

5342
03:32:55.020 --> 03:32:57.860 line:15%
and then do a little loopy-loop.

5343
03:32:57.860 --> 03:32:58.693 line:15%
This is going--
Yours is

5344
03:32:58.693 --> 03:33:00.050 line:15%
getting there, actually, yeah.

5345
03:33:00.050 --> 03:33:02.340 line:15%
Gotta put a little itty bitty--

5346
03:33:02.340 --> 03:33:04.070 line:15%
Ah, like more two more weeks.

5347
03:33:05.068 --> 03:33:06.870 line:15%
Are you on your way to karate class, loverboy?

5348
03:33:06.870 --> 03:33:09.304 line:15%
Do a ribbon on that bitch.

5349
03:33:09.304 --> 03:33:14.150 line:15%
I pick like a piece of grass and tie it around.

5350
03:33:14.150 --> 03:33:17.862 line:15%
There you go, nailed it.
Fuck yeah.

5351
03:33:17.862 --> 03:33:20.112 line:15%
(laughing)

5352
03:33:22.390 --> 03:33:24.410 line:15%
So, it's getting mid-afternoon at this point.

5353
03:33:24.410 --> 03:33:26.090 line:15%
With your time in Rosohna, you probably

5354
03:33:26.090 --> 03:33:28.120 line:15%
are a few hours away from dusk.

5355
03:33:28.120 --> 03:33:29.490 line:15%
You push for the first hour in,

5356
03:33:29.490 --> 03:33:32.620 line:15%
this is gonna be another traversing

5357
03:33:32.620 --> 03:33:36.380 line:15%
a dangerous element of nature skill challenge.

5358
03:33:36.380 --> 03:33:39.570 line:15%
So, who wants to helm the first leg of this?

5359
03:33:39.570 --> 03:33:44.310 line:15%
I'll do it with a Perception and my sense of where

5360
03:33:44.310 --> 03:33:45.700 line:15%
I was being led.
You got it.

5361
03:33:45.700 --> 03:33:48.600 line:15%
Before we head out, Caleb reaches a pearl

5362
03:33:48.600 --> 03:33:51.360 line:15%
way up high to Caduceus' forehead and casts

5363
03:33:51.360 --> 03:33:55.050 line:15%
for a few moments and casts Fortune's Favor on you.

5364
03:33:55.050 --> 03:33:56.740 line:15%
All right.
So it's--

5365
03:33:56.740 --> 03:33:58.590 line:15%
One luck for the day whenever, it could be now,

5366
03:33:58.590 --> 03:34:00.190 line:15%
it could be later.
All right.

5367
03:34:01.730 --> 03:34:03.910 line:15%
Nice, so Perception, I'm gonna

5368
03:34:03.910 --> 03:34:05.960 line:15%
give myself a little boost as well.

5369
03:34:08.000 --> 03:34:09.600 line:15%
Yow.
I'll just do a small--

5370
03:34:10.830 --> 03:34:13.610 line:15%
That's 21, 24.
Ooh.

5371
03:34:13.610 --> 03:34:14.810 line:15%
24, okay.

5372
03:34:16.341 --> 03:34:17.174 line:15%
Damn.

5373
03:34:17.174 --> 03:34:18.160 line:15%
In helping lead the group forward,

5374
03:34:18.160 --> 03:34:20.250 line:15%
you find what seems to be the clearest path

5375
03:34:20.250 --> 03:34:22.750 line:15%
that doesn't immediately cause you

5376
03:34:22.750 --> 03:34:25.270 line:15%
to slow in your travel through.

5377
03:34:25.270 --> 03:34:27.970 line:15%
The earlier parts of this jungle are dense,

5378
03:34:27.970 --> 03:34:30.720 line:15%
but it's getting denser, and at least this first part

5379
03:34:30.720 --> 03:34:34.640 line:15%
doesn't seem to be as dangerous as you surmised

5380
03:34:34.640 --> 03:34:36.170 line:15%
the interior may have been alluded to

5381
03:34:36.170 --> 03:34:39.230 line:15%
by your conversation with the Wildmother Melora.

5382
03:34:39.230 --> 03:34:41.410 line:15%
It's beautiful, it's calming, and for those of you

5383
03:34:41.410 --> 03:34:44.080 line:15%
who have never spent much time in tropical settings,

5384
03:34:44.080 --> 03:34:48.270 line:15%
in particular you, Yasha, who, of everyone here,

5385
03:34:48.270 --> 03:34:50.080 line:15%
has probably been the most removed from

5386
03:34:50.080 --> 03:34:54.590 line:15%
a lot of these spaces, it is, it's gorgeous.

5387
03:34:54.590 --> 03:34:56.540 line:15%
And some of the flowers, themselves bright and vibrant,

5388
03:34:56.540 --> 03:34:59.520 line:15%
you can't help but wanting to kind of pick and keep.

5389
03:34:59.520 --> 03:35:00.353 line:15%
Caduceus,

5390
03:35:02.260 --> 03:35:04.600 line:15%
can I take a flower from here?

5391
03:35:04.600 --> 03:35:06.340 line:15%
Let me know and I'll ask permission.

5392
03:35:06.340 --> 03:35:10.330 line:15%
Some of these things also do bite, you gotta be careful.

5393
03:35:10.330 --> 03:35:12.872 line:15%
Make a nature check for me.
All right.

5394
03:35:12.872 --> 03:35:15.179 line:15%
(birds tweeting)

5395
03:35:15.179 --> 03:35:16.170 line:15%
(dice clattering)

5396
03:35:16.170 --> 03:35:17.967 line:15%
I wanna re-roll that, I'm using my,

5397
03:35:17.967 --> 03:35:19.170 line:15%
(dice clattering)

5398
03:35:19.170 --> 03:35:20.890 line:15%
pff, even worse.
So soon?

5399
03:35:20.890 --> 03:35:22.000 line:15%
Already?
Poof.

5400
03:35:22.000 --> 03:35:24.830 line:15%
That was sad, a four.
What?

5401
03:35:24.830 --> 03:35:27.110 line:15%
Wait, what was the other?
Eight.

5402
03:35:28.430 --> 03:35:31.156 line:15%
As you get to look at the writing on the--

5403
03:35:31.156 --> 03:35:33.490 line:15%
So, you just take the--
It's like a luck point,

5404
03:35:33.490 --> 03:35:34.470 line:15%
so you can roll twice and then

5405
03:35:34.470 --> 03:35:36.340 line:15%
take the higher.
Lemme check.

5406
03:35:36.340 --> 03:35:37.173 line:15%
Oh, then eight.
Oh.

5407
03:35:37.173 --> 03:35:38.672 line:15%
(pages flipping)

5408
03:35:38.672 --> 03:35:39.803 line:15%
Ooh, hot dog.

5409
03:35:39.803 --> 03:35:42.570 line:15%
(laughing)

5410
03:35:42.570 --> 03:35:44.613 line:15%
Choose which to use.
Eight.

5411
03:35:44.613 --> 03:35:46.820 line:15%
(laughing)

5412
03:35:46.820 --> 03:35:47.653 line:15%
Eight.
Okay,

5413
03:35:47.653 --> 03:35:48.900 line:15%
I don't know which ones are--

5414
03:35:49.750 --> 03:35:51.070 line:15%
You point out one flower, you think,

5415
03:35:51.070 --> 03:35:52.730 line:15%
"Oh, that's brightly colored, that's probably dangerous.

5416
03:35:52.730 --> 03:35:56.240 line:15%
"That one's kinda muted, that one you can probably pick."

5417
03:35:56.240 --> 03:35:57.073 line:15%
Pick.

5418
03:35:57.073 --> 03:35:58.194 line:15%
I asked permission, of course, before we

5419
03:35:58.194 --> 03:36:00.060 line:15%
You did, it's more or less consent.

5420
03:36:00.060 --> 03:36:01.307 line:15%
Yeah.

5421
03:36:01.307 --> 03:36:04.057 line:15%
(birds tweeting)

5422
03:36:04.950 --> 03:36:06.290 line:15%
You really don't know what you're talking about

5423
03:36:06.290 --> 03:36:07.860 line:15%
in this particular instance, but luckily,

5424
03:36:07.860 --> 03:36:09.190 line:15%
there wasn't a huge issue with this one,

5425
03:36:09.190 --> 03:36:10.978 line:15%
so you pluck the flower without a problem.

5426
03:36:10.978 --> 03:36:11.811 line:15%
(aggressive hissing)

5427
03:36:11.811 --> 03:36:13.005 line:15%
Yeah, you were very lucky.

5428
03:36:13.005 --> 03:36:13.981 line:15%
(imitated scrabbling)

5429
03:36:13.981 --> 03:36:15.157 line:15%
What is it--
Oh god,

5430
03:36:15.157 --> 03:36:16.980 line:15%
oh god!
What is it?

5431
03:36:16.980 --> 03:36:18.730 line:15%
It's a kind of--
It was a cricket.

5432
03:36:18.730 --> 03:36:22.890 line:15%
Like a teal color that towards the edges of the petals,

5433
03:36:22.890 --> 03:36:24.320 line:15%
and it's a wide flower, it's that big,

5434
03:36:24.320 --> 03:36:28.120 line:15%
the edges of the petals, it tends to go to a deep sea blue.

5435
03:36:28.120 --> 03:36:29.920 line:15%
It's a frog that looks like a flower.

5436
03:36:29.920 --> 03:36:30.753 line:15%
It's very pretty.

5437
03:36:30.753 --> 03:36:31.740 line:15%
(coughing)

5438
03:36:31.740 --> 03:36:32.960 line:15%
It does that, too.

5439
03:36:32.960 --> 03:36:35.860 line:15%
But you manage to find the best path forward

5440
03:36:35.860 --> 03:36:38.980 line:15%
that does not slow your progression into the jungle.

5441
03:36:38.980 --> 03:36:41.440 line:15%
Who wants to helm the next leg of this?

5442
03:36:43.540 --> 03:36:45.230 line:15%
I will try.
Oh.

5443
03:36:45.230 --> 03:36:46.830 line:15%
Yeah.
All right.

5444
03:36:46.830 --> 03:36:47.720 line:15%
Can we--
What're you doing

5445
03:36:47.720 --> 03:36:49.538 line:15%
to help here?
Kind of--

5446
03:36:49.538 --> 03:36:50.550 line:15%
Oh, mm.
Beep.

5447
03:36:50.550 --> 03:36:52.414 line:15%
Wa-wa-wa-wa-wa-wa.

5448
03:36:52.414 --> 03:36:53.247 line:15%
(smacking)

5449
03:36:53.247 --> 03:36:54.224 line:15%
Ah.
Mosquito.

5450
03:36:54.224 --> 03:36:55.892 line:15%
No, that was just Liam.
Oh.

5451
03:36:55.892 --> 03:36:56.725 line:15%
(laughing)

5452
03:36:56.725 --> 03:36:58.990 line:15%
I'll step forward and I'll say, "Listen,

5453
03:36:58.990 --> 03:37:03.480 line:15%
"you fucking jungle, I'm a Paladin of the Wildmother.

5454
03:37:03.480 --> 03:37:06.870 line:15%
"You're gonna move or we're gonna bust you right open.

5455
03:37:06.870 --> 03:37:09.130 line:15%
"We'll wreck this place.

5456
03:37:09.130 --> 03:37:12.240 line:15%
"Don't make me fuckin' tell you twice."

5457
03:37:12.240 --> 03:37:13.912 line:15%
Can I intimidate it?

5458
03:37:13.912 --> 03:37:15.030 line:15%
(laughing)

5459
03:37:15.030 --> 03:37:16.670 line:15%
Go ahead and roll intimidation.

5460
03:37:16.670 --> 03:37:17.710 line:15%
I love that you tried to

5461
03:37:17.710 --> 03:37:19.240 line:15%
deceive and intimidate.
This is not going to

5462
03:37:19.240 --> 03:37:21.800 line:15%
go well.
Yes, intimidate the woods,

5463
03:37:21.800 --> 03:37:23.741 line:15%
yes!
21.

5464
03:37:23.741 --> 03:37:24.574 line:15%
Yes!

5465
03:37:25.440 --> 03:37:26.273 line:15%
Okay.

5466
03:37:27.700 --> 03:37:29.850 line:15%
You shout out loudly into the jungle,

5467
03:37:29.850 --> 03:37:31.020 line:15%
out in front of your, just yelling.

5468
03:37:31.020 --> 03:37:33.120 line:15%
You can see all these birds like (makes fluttering noise)

5469
03:37:33.120 --> 03:37:35.570 line:15%
scatter from above the canopy, things start

5470
03:37:35.570 --> 03:37:37.370 line:15%
rushing and running outta the space.

5471
03:37:38.977 --> 03:37:40.161 line:15%
It looks pretty quiet.

5472
03:37:40.161 --> 03:37:42.272 line:15%
(laughing)

5473
03:37:42.272 --> 03:37:43.470 line:15%
Not bad.
I could intimidate it,

5474
03:37:43.470 --> 03:37:45.110 line:15%
for sure
It's the hairdo.

5475
03:37:45.110 --> 03:37:46.500 line:15%
Yep.
Yeah.

5476
03:37:46.500 --> 03:37:48.770 line:15%
You take a confident step forward.

5477
03:37:48.770 --> 03:37:49.707 line:15%
(imitated slamming noise)

5478
03:37:49.707 --> 03:37:50.802 line:15%
Ahh!

5479
03:37:50.802 --> 03:37:52.649 line:15%
(laughing)

5480
03:37:52.649 --> 03:37:55.880 line:15%
A massive plant that was just beyond the root

5481
03:37:55.880 --> 03:37:58.850 line:15%
you were standing on just devours Fjord,

5482
03:37:58.850 --> 03:38:03.850 line:15%
just completely vanishes inside of a large flytrap-like pod.

5483
03:38:05.690 --> 03:38:07.629 line:15%
Use your luck point!

5484
03:38:07.629 --> 03:38:09.330 line:15%
(laughing)

5485
03:38:09.330 --> 03:38:10.642 line:15%
Oh no.
You hear--

5486
03:38:10.642 --> 03:38:13.590 line:15%
I try to pull it open.
Roll a strength check.

5487
03:38:13.590 --> 03:38:15.315 line:15%
Okay.
Oh my gosh.

5488
03:38:15.315 --> 03:38:17.067 line:15%
(dice clattering)

5489
03:38:17.067 --> 03:38:17.900 line:15%
I'm giving you a D4--
Take

5490
03:38:17.900 --> 03:38:19.214 line:15%
eight points of acid damage, Fjord.

5491
03:38:19.214 --> 03:38:20.336 line:15%
(groaning)

5492
03:38:20.336 --> 03:38:21.169 line:15%
I'm giving you a D4 on that, too..

5493
03:38:21.169 --> 03:38:22.530 line:15%
D4? Okay.
Yeah.

5494
03:38:23.418 --> 03:38:24.650 line:15%
(laughing)

5495
03:38:24.650 --> 03:38:26.952 line:15%
Oh, good. 18?
18.

5496
03:38:26.952 --> 03:38:30.000 line:15%
(groans) You start pulling the pod open.

5497
03:38:30.000 --> 03:38:31.780 line:15%
You're in there, it's not enough to quite get him out,

5498
03:38:31.780 --> 03:38:34.160 line:15%
like you don't pull him out, but the pod is open.

5499
03:38:34.160 --> 03:38:35.690 line:15%
You can go ahead and attempt to escape if you'd like.

5500
03:38:35.690 --> 03:38:37.290 line:15%
I would like to please, yes,

5501
03:38:37.290 --> 03:38:40.950 line:15%
I summon the sword and just try and--

5502
03:38:40.950 --> 03:38:42.410 line:15%
I'll say it's easy enough.

5503
03:38:42.410 --> 03:38:45.050 line:15%
Okay.
This plant looks

5504
03:38:45.050 --> 03:38:48.150 line:15%
more dangerous than it really is and between the two of you,

5505
03:38:48.150 --> 03:38:50.710 line:15%
you manage to get him out and it slowly

5506
03:38:50.710 --> 03:38:53.151 line:15%
kind of like (makes ripping noise) pulls open.

5507
03:38:53.151 --> 03:38:55.138 line:15%
(screaming and panting)

5508
03:38:55.138 --> 03:38:57.680 line:15%
Good job, Fjord, now we know to watch out for those.

5509
03:38:57.680 --> 03:39:01.510 line:15%
Yeah, maybe we should be quiet, just a thought.

5510
03:39:02.590 --> 03:39:03.423 line:15%
Sorry.

5511
03:39:04.680 --> 03:39:06.467 line:15%
Ah, it stings.

5512
03:39:06.467 --> 03:39:09.279 line:15%
(laughing)

5513
03:39:09.279 --> 03:39:10.750 line:15%
The pod is a purplish color on the outside,

5514
03:39:10.750 --> 03:39:14.230 line:15%
which is very glaring, but when it's open,

5515
03:39:14.230 --> 03:39:15.830 line:15%
the interior itself is almost perfectly

5516
03:39:15.830 --> 03:39:18.320 line:15%
camouflaged with the extremely green--

5517
03:39:18.320 --> 03:39:20.310 line:15%
We need to definitely--
So, now we know what to

5518
03:39:20.310 --> 03:39:22.070 line:15%
look for.
Yes.

5519
03:39:22.070 --> 03:39:24.300 line:15%
We look for ground that looks like ground.

5520
03:39:24.300 --> 03:39:26.182 line:15%
It looks like a big-ass mouth.

5521
03:39:26.182 --> 03:39:27.940 line:15%
(coughing)

5522
03:39:27.940 --> 03:39:28.800 line:15%
Careful.
Sorry.

5523
03:39:28.800 --> 03:39:29.633 line:15%
Smart.

5524
03:39:30.960 --> 03:39:32.440 line:15%
(laughing)

5525
03:39:32.440 --> 03:39:35.222 line:15%
All right, who would like to take this next leg?

5526
03:39:35.222 --> 03:39:37.048 line:15%
Um.
Oh boy.

5527
03:39:37.048 --> 03:39:39.200 line:15%
I'll take it.
Okay.

5528
03:39:39.200 --> 03:39:41.800 line:15%
Good.
Okay, well what skill,

5529
03:39:41.800 --> 03:39:45.980 line:15%
what are you attempting to aid this journey with and how--

5530
03:39:45.980 --> 03:39:47.140 line:15%
Oh, I was just gonna do a survival.

5531
03:39:47.140 --> 03:39:49.020 line:15%
You could do the survival, that's a way to do it.

5532
03:39:49.020 --> 03:39:50.930 line:15%
No, let me think if there's something better here--

5533
03:39:50.930 --> 03:39:52.190 line:15%
Just explain how it pertains to--

5534
03:39:52.190 --> 03:39:53.948 line:15%
It's better than intimidation.

5535
03:39:53.948 --> 03:39:54.980 line:15%
(laughing)

5536
03:39:54.980 --> 03:39:56.660 line:15%
If you rolled high enough,

5537
03:39:56.660 --> 03:39:59.210 line:15%
I was like, "I'll figure out somethin'."

5538
03:39:59.210 --> 03:40:01.500 line:15%
Can I try to

5539
03:40:03.020 --> 03:40:05.140 line:15%
look at the path and

5540
03:40:06.990 --> 03:40:11.990 line:15%
investigate to see if there's a nice, easy way through?

5541
03:40:13.080 --> 03:40:15.760 line:15%
Investigation could possibly, yeah, you could

5542
03:40:17.051 --> 03:40:17.946 line:15%
give it a shot.
Slow down, Orphan Maker.

5543
03:40:17.946 --> 03:40:19.480 line:15%
Puts the pearl up to her head.

5544
03:40:19.480 --> 03:40:22.270 line:15%
Beep beep beep beep beep.
It lasts for a whole day?

5545
03:40:22.270 --> 03:40:23.460 line:15%
Wow.
Lasts for an hour.

5546
03:40:23.460 --> 03:40:25.389 line:15%
Hour, okay.
'Kay.

5547
03:40:25.389 --> 03:40:28.450 line:15%
(dice clattering)

5548
03:40:28.450 --> 03:40:29.850 line:15%
That means I can re-roll?

5549
03:40:29.850 --> 03:40:31.200 line:15%
Yeah, right now.
Okay.

5550
03:40:32.794 --> 03:40:33.970 line:15%
Oh, it's cocked.

5551
03:40:34.920 --> 03:40:36.680 line:15%
It's cocked again, I'm sorry.

5552
03:40:36.680 --> 03:40:38.480 line:15%
Throw that die in the--
No, I love it,

5553
03:40:38.480 --> 03:40:40.024 line:15%
though, when it rolls well.

5554
03:40:40.024 --> 03:40:41.201 line:15%
(laughing)

5555
03:40:41.201 --> 03:40:42.433 line:15%
When it rolls well.

5556
03:40:42.433 --> 03:40:43.490 line:15%
It certainly wasn't the last time you rolled,

5557
03:40:43.490 --> 03:40:45.890 line:15%
that was really bad.
19.

5558
03:40:45.890 --> 03:40:47.100 line:15%
19, okay.

5559
03:40:49.730 --> 03:40:53.860 line:15%
You do slow the travel of the group slightly

5560
03:40:53.860 --> 03:40:55.840 line:15%
because you're taking the time to be very careful.

5561
03:40:55.840 --> 03:40:58.480 line:15%
This is your, while you're not used to jungle,

5562
03:40:58.480 --> 03:41:01.000 line:15%
you're definitely used to dangerous marshland

5563
03:41:01.000 --> 03:41:03.900 line:15%
and tangled paths through heavy vegetation,

5564
03:41:03.900 --> 03:41:05.890 line:15%
though a very different kind, but there's

5565
03:41:05.890 --> 03:41:07.600 line:15%
some elements that are consistent through

5566
03:41:07.600 --> 03:41:09.050 line:15%
and, you know, Beau backs you up a little bit too,

5567
03:41:09.050 --> 03:41:11.980 line:15%
being very keen in the eyes, but peering through,

5568
03:41:11.980 --> 03:41:14.550 line:15%
you find the areas that immediately look like

5569
03:41:14.550 --> 03:41:16.270 line:15%
they've been walked a little more by the wildlife,

5570
03:41:16.270 --> 03:41:17.460 line:15%
which means they're the ones that are probably the most

5571
03:41:17.460 --> 03:41:21.020 line:15%
successfully traversed by those that live here often.

5572
03:41:21.020 --> 03:41:23.010 line:15%
And following those paths, those trails,

5573
03:41:23.010 --> 03:41:26.270 line:15%
and the signs of edges of trees where you can

5574
03:41:26.270 --> 03:41:28.460 line:15%
see darkening coloration from animals that have

5575
03:41:28.460 --> 03:41:30.520 line:15%
brushed against it to mark their territory and such,

5576
03:41:30.520 --> 03:41:33.180 line:15%
you see the familiar signs of these things and go,

5577
03:41:33.180 --> 03:41:34.610 line:15%
"This is probably where we should go."

5578
03:41:35.780 --> 03:41:38.470 line:15%
And you do manage to get on for another hour or so

5579
03:41:38.470 --> 03:41:40.180 line:15%
without any serious issue.
Hey!

5580
03:41:41.570 --> 03:41:44.020 line:15%
It is starting to get dark.

5581
03:41:44.020 --> 03:41:46.274 line:15%
What's the ground look like here?

5582
03:41:46.274 --> 03:41:48.140 line:15%
I mean, it's rough.

5583
03:41:48.140 --> 03:41:50.840 line:15%
You could take awhile to search for

5584
03:41:50.840 --> 03:41:54.220 line:15%
a place to set up a dome comfortably,

5585
03:41:54.220 --> 03:41:55.410 line:15%
that'll probably take the rest of the time

5586
03:41:55.410 --> 03:41:56.750 line:15%
before the daylight closes, or you can--

5587
03:41:56.750 --> 03:41:58.870 line:15%
Caleb lights up his hand as they're walking.

5588
03:41:58.870 --> 03:42:00.963 line:15%
Mmkay.
Do you think, should we--

5589
03:42:00.963 --> 03:42:02.449 line:15%
You'll have to probably clear a area, too, to make--

5590
03:42:02.449 --> 03:42:03.613 line:15%
We try to, like, find a dome spot

5591
03:42:03.613 --> 03:42:06.470 line:15%
or travel through the night?
There are also trees here.

5592
03:42:06.470 --> 03:42:08.690 line:15%
I mean, I've heard of camping in the trees.

5593
03:42:09.820 --> 03:42:10.653 line:15%
Actually--
Yeah, there's probably

5594
03:42:10.653 --> 03:42:15.420 line:15%
large cats and evil animals, maybe, that live up there.

5595
03:42:16.350 --> 03:42:17.790 line:15%
What're you basing that off of?

5596
03:42:17.790 --> 03:42:19.650 line:15%
I don't know, the books I read?

5597
03:42:19.650 --> 03:42:21.520 line:15%
We're near the menagerie, which means there could be

5598
03:42:21.520 --> 03:42:25.430 line:15%
all sorts of strange animal life, it could be very varied.

5599
03:42:25.430 --> 03:42:26.784 line:15%
Is there a tree nearby?

5600
03:42:26.784 --> 03:42:28.770 line:15%
There are trees everywhere nearby.

5601
03:42:28.770 --> 03:42:31.350 line:15%
Surrounded by trees.
Tall ones?

5602
03:42:31.350 --> 03:42:32.900 line:15%
They're all, I mean, from what you can tell,

5603
03:42:32.900 --> 03:42:35.050 line:15%
I mean, the canopies are kinda low for

5604
03:42:35.050 --> 03:42:37.120 line:15%
the thickness of them, they're very squat jungle trees.

5605
03:42:37.120 --> 03:42:40.100 line:15%
You're not quite sure how tall, you know,

5606
03:42:40.100 --> 03:42:41.410 line:15%
from where you currently are, they are,

5607
03:42:41.410 --> 03:42:44.020 line:15%
but some of them are probably a good 20 or so feet up.

5608
03:42:44.020 --> 03:42:47.110 line:15%
I'm gonna, if I'm nearby, judge the

5609
03:42:47.110 --> 03:42:50.160 line:15%
tallest one that I have and climb it.

5610
03:42:50.160 --> 03:42:52.420 line:15%
Okay, this one looks to probably close to 30 or so feet.

5611
03:42:52.420 --> 03:42:54.660 line:15%
All right, climb it for vantage.

5612
03:42:54.660 --> 03:42:56.660 line:15%
Okay, go.
I'm gonna smack her butt

5613
03:42:56.660 --> 03:42:59.630 line:15%
on the way up and say, "Traveler loves you."

5614
03:42:59.630 --> 03:43:02.420 line:15%
Thanks.
You're guided.

5615
03:43:02.420 --> 03:43:04.980 line:15%
You can take the athletics or acrobatics, your choice.

5616
03:43:04.980 --> 03:43:08.310 line:15%
I will take acrobatics.
Half fire up your butt.

5617
03:43:08.310 --> 03:43:13.090 line:15%
And do I have a, my wall run type of situation,

5618
03:43:13.090 --> 03:43:15.614 line:15%
my Unarmored Movement?
Yes, you do.

5619
03:43:15.614 --> 03:43:20.280 line:15%
That's right 'cause you can--
Run up vertical surfaces.

5620
03:43:20.280 --> 03:43:22.090 line:15%
So you actually probably don't even have to roll for this.

5621
03:43:22.090 --> 03:43:24.110 line:15%
Monk yeah.
Frickin' monks.

5622
03:43:29.046 --> 03:43:31.333 line:15%
Yeah, this is part of the, ch-ch-ch, there it is.

5623
03:43:31.333 --> 03:43:33.940 line:15%
(birds tweeting)

5624
03:43:33.940 --> 03:43:34.773 line:15%
What's up with that?

5625
03:43:34.773 --> 03:43:36.280 line:15%
That's an interesting looking die you have there.

5626
03:43:36.280 --> 03:43:38.200 line:15%
This is the goldfish.
Oh, it's the goldfish.

5627
03:43:38.200 --> 03:43:39.670 line:15%
Oh, that's right.
Oh, that's awesome.

5628
03:43:39.670 --> 03:43:40.503 line:15%
Yeah.

5629
03:43:41.864 --> 03:43:42.697 line:15%
(birds tweeting)

5630
03:43:42.697 --> 03:43:44.000 line:15%
That's part of the Slow Fall on them?

5631
03:43:45.050 --> 03:43:49.970 line:15%
No, Unarmored Movement.
Oh, there it is, gotcha.

5632
03:43:52.450 --> 03:43:53.630 line:15%
So yeah, with your current movement,

5633
03:43:53.630 --> 03:43:55.340 line:15%
you could probably just, don't even have to roll,

5634
03:43:55.340 --> 03:43:57.480 line:15%
you can just run up that tree.
Cool.

5635
03:43:57.480 --> 03:43:59.680 line:15%
"Thanks, Traveler," and I run up.

5636
03:43:59.680 --> 03:44:02.190 line:15%
You see Beau just gets a running start and

5637
03:44:02.190 --> 03:44:04.530 line:15%
(makes running noises) and vanishes.

5638
03:44:06.357 --> 03:44:07.190 line:15%
She is.
She thinks it's

5639
03:44:07.190 --> 03:44:08.920 line:15%
the Traveler, it's just because Jester

5640
03:44:08.920 --> 03:44:10.190 line:15%
smacked her on the ass, though.

5641
03:44:10.190 --> 03:44:11.500 line:15%
There you go.
Yeah.

5642
03:44:11.500 --> 03:44:13.900 line:15%
I'm just very invigorated by that.

5643
03:44:13.900 --> 03:44:15.260 line:15%
Yeah.
I respect it.

5644
03:44:15.260 --> 03:44:18.110 line:15%
Okay, you head up to the top and glance over

5645
03:44:18.110 --> 03:44:21.010 line:15%
and immediately, your eyes are kind of taken by

5646
03:44:21.010 --> 03:44:23.940 line:15%
the bright sunlight.
Oh, it's still daylight.

5647
03:44:23.940 --> 03:44:26.650 line:15%
Well, it's, you're getting close, you have about

5648
03:44:26.650 --> 03:44:29.540 line:15%
an hour or so before you lose all daylight,

5649
03:44:29.540 --> 03:44:30.840 line:15%
it's starting to get that dusk color,

5650
03:44:30.840 --> 03:44:33.280 line:15%
but it's still setting in that direction

5651
03:44:33.280 --> 03:44:35.890 line:15%
and the bright kind of orange-yellow color of it that way

5652
03:44:35.890 --> 03:44:38.450 line:15%
catches you from the dark canopy that you ran up.

5653
03:44:38.450 --> 03:44:40.080 line:15%
Dark under the trees.
It's beautiful, though.

5654
03:44:40.080 --> 03:44:42.060 line:15%
The view here, you can see all the ocean

5655
03:44:42.060 --> 03:44:43.410 line:15%
to the distance, just past the canopy,

5656
03:44:43.410 --> 03:44:46.070 line:15%
and it's thick and it goes on endlessly.

5657
03:44:46.070 --> 03:44:48.060 line:15%
In fact, all you can pretty much see is just green

5658
03:44:48.060 --> 03:44:50.970 line:15%
and a little bitta blue on the horizon to the South.

5659
03:44:50.970 --> 03:44:53.050 line:15%
And that's kinda what catches you in the moment.

5660
03:44:54.713 --> 03:44:57.830 line:15%
I try to, I kinda blink my eyes to focus.

5661
03:44:57.830 --> 03:45:01.630 line:15%
Any clearings nearby, any patches?

5662
03:45:01.630 --> 03:45:03.429 line:15%
Make a perception check.

5663
03:45:03.429 --> 03:45:04.641 line:15%
(dice clattering)

5664
03:45:04.641 --> 03:45:05.790 line:15%
Bilbo Baggins.
You still have that D4.

5665
03:45:05.790 --> 03:45:07.220 line:15%
Okay, okay--
Butterflies.

5666
03:45:07.220 --> 03:45:09.430 line:15%
I still have a D4?
Baggins moment.

5667
03:45:09.430 --> 03:45:10.963 line:15%
Butterflies.
From--

5668
03:45:10.963 --> 03:45:13.190 line:15%
From the bless?
She didn't burn it,

5669
03:45:13.190 --> 03:45:14.880 line:15%
the bless just holds until you use it.

5670
03:45:14.880 --> 03:45:15.713 line:15%
Oh, you used bless.

5671
03:45:15.713 --> 03:45:16.820 line:15%
I got it.
No.

5672
03:45:16.820 --> 03:45:18.100 line:15%
No, not bless, it's--
Guidance.

5673
03:45:18.100 --> 03:45:19.560 line:15%
Guidance, guidance just holds until you use it.

5674
03:45:19.560 --> 03:45:21.810 line:15%
You used that for a round, I'll allow it

5675
03:45:21.810 --> 03:45:24.100 line:15%
'cause you ran it pretty quick in one round, sure.

5676
03:45:24.100 --> 03:45:25.680 line:15%
Okay then.
I'll allow it.

5677
03:45:25.680 --> 03:45:29.190 line:15%
That is 25.
Up to a minute.

5678
03:45:29.190 --> 03:45:31.580 line:15%
25, okay.
Yeah, total.

5679
03:45:31.580 --> 03:45:34.832 line:15%
Guidance is up to a minute.
Oh, up until used? Got it.

5680
03:45:34.832 --> 03:45:37.830 line:15%
That's right, that's right, a minute.

5681
03:45:37.830 --> 03:45:40.200 line:15%
All right, so yeah, you kind of focus your eyes

5682
03:45:40.200 --> 03:45:42.190 line:15%
for a second, glance out and you--

5683
03:45:42.190 --> 03:45:44.090 line:15%
Doin' it for Jester. (groans)

5684
03:45:44.090 --> 03:45:45.110 line:15%
You think you see,

5685
03:45:49.120 --> 03:45:51.040 line:15%
probably about a quarter mile off

5686
03:45:51.040 --> 03:45:54.960
in a Southwestern direction,

5687
03:45:54.960 --> 03:45:58.000 line:15%
an area where the canopy kinda folds in a bit,

5688
03:45:58.000 --> 03:45:59.690 line:15%
what would be a small pocket that

5689
03:45:59.690 --> 03:46:02.160 line:15%
isn't completely flush with the rest of

5690
03:46:02.160 --> 03:46:04.730 line:15%
the treeline within your immediate vicinity.

5691
03:46:04.730 --> 03:46:06.350 line:15%
That is, wait, what?
Isn't.

5692
03:46:06.350 --> 03:46:08.071 line:15%
Isn't.
By a clearing.

5693
03:46:08.071 --> 03:46:08.904 line:15%
Okay.
There's a little clearing.

5694
03:46:08.904 --> 03:46:09.737 line:15%
The closest you can think of is--

5695
03:46:09.737 --> 03:46:14.600 line:15%
A quarter mile West, is that what you just said?

5696
03:46:14.600 --> 03:46:16.770 line:15%
Southwest of where you--
Southwest, okay.

5697
03:46:16.770 --> 03:46:18.230 line:15%
I climb back down.

5698
03:46:18.230 --> 03:46:21.080 line:15%
Quarter mile, Southwest, follow me.

5699
03:46:21.080 --> 03:46:23.030 line:15%
Yeah, not far, like 10 minutes.

5700
03:46:24.647 --> 03:46:25.540 line:15%
All right.
Quarter mile, yeah.

5701
03:46:25.540 --> 03:46:27.720 line:15%
Quarter mile, yeah.
Mmkay.

5702
03:46:27.720 --> 03:46:30.300 line:15%
20 minutes, 30 minutes.
Following Beau's lead--

5703
03:46:30.300 --> 03:46:32.920 line:15%
15 minutes.
And you guys

5704
03:46:32.920 --> 03:46:35.590 line:15%
continue to carve through the jungle path.

5705
03:46:35.590 --> 03:46:38.120 line:15%
You eventually come upon a small element of the clearing

5706
03:46:38.120 --> 03:46:41.190 line:15%
where you can see a tree has fallen.

5707
03:46:41.190 --> 03:46:45.610 line:15%
It was, you know, either it was really old or really sick.

5708
03:46:45.610 --> 03:46:47.910 line:15%
It kind of collapsed under its own weight to one side,

5709
03:46:47.910 --> 03:46:51.170 line:15%
the roots tearing up on the one end and you can see

5710
03:46:51.170 --> 03:46:54.650 line:15%
the inside of where the exposed roots of it are,

5711
03:46:54.650 --> 03:46:56.220 line:15%
it's been kind of hollowed out and it's probably home

5712
03:46:56.220 --> 03:46:58.970 line:15%
to a number of creatures that aren't currently present.

5713
03:46:59.880 --> 03:47:02.590 line:15%
But it is a clearing where you could

5714
03:47:02.590 --> 03:47:04.740 line:15%
place the dome relatively comfortably there.

5715
03:47:04.740 --> 03:47:05.850 line:15%
You'd have kind of clear the floor

5716
03:47:05.850 --> 03:47:09.130 line:15%
from some of the nearby ferns and other--

5717
03:47:09.130 --> 03:47:11.900 line:15%
Is it my imagination that something probably lives here?

5718
03:47:11.900 --> 03:47:13.190 line:15%
I mean, there's a--
I'll just take a look to see

5719
03:47:13.190 --> 03:47:15.640 line:15%
if it seems like something big lives inside this tree.

5720
03:47:15.640 --> 03:47:17.440 line:15%
Okay, make a nature check.
Oof.

5721
03:47:19.735 --> 03:47:21.051 line:15%
(dice clattering)

5722
03:47:21.051 --> 03:47:22.150 line:15%
(paper rustling)

5723
03:47:22.150 --> 03:47:24.830 line:15%
My nature is terrible, which is part of the fun of this.

5724
03:47:27.210 --> 03:47:29.380 line:15%
14.
14's not too bad.

5725
03:47:30.590 --> 03:47:32.340 line:15%
From what you can tell, elements of this

5726
03:47:32.340 --> 03:47:34.370 line:15%
have been carved and hollowed out by

5727
03:47:35.410 --> 03:47:40.330 line:15%
probably some sort of a rodent-type creature,

5728
03:47:40.330 --> 03:47:42.810 line:15%
based on the tooth marks and the scratches,

5729
03:47:42.810 --> 03:47:45.040 line:15%
probably no larger than that size

5730
03:47:45.040 --> 03:47:48.160 line:15%
and probably a dozen or so have made homes within

5731
03:47:48.160 --> 03:47:49.950 line:15%
the base of the tree.

5732
03:47:51.790 --> 03:47:53.270 line:15%
How big would I imagine

5733
03:47:53.270 --> 03:47:55.020 line:15%
these creatures to be, like this big?

5734
03:47:55.020 --> 03:47:56.700 line:15%
Like about as big as I just showed you,

5735
03:47:56.700 --> 03:47:57.810 line:15%
yeah.
Okay.

5736
03:47:59.430 --> 03:48:02.040 line:15%
There's a buncha little animals that live in this.

5737
03:48:02.040 --> 03:48:03.580 line:15%
I don't know if we should camp inside,

5738
03:48:03.580 --> 03:48:05.000 line:15%
I think maybe off to the side--

5739
03:48:05.000 --> 03:48:06.650 line:15%
Sprinkle, you can make some friends!

5740
03:48:06.650 --> 03:48:08.510 line:15%
We don't disturb them.

5741
03:48:08.510 --> 03:48:09.343 line:15%
Oh.

5742
03:48:09.343 --> 03:48:10.190 line:15%
I don't think he wants to make--

5743
03:48:10.190 --> 03:48:12.540 line:15%
Maybe he'll want to stay here forever.

5744
03:48:12.540 --> 03:48:14.606 line:15%
(wheezing)

5745
03:48:14.606 --> 03:48:17.770 line:15%
Where he can live, can live a life of an animal.

5746
03:48:19.400 --> 03:48:21.200 line:15%
For like a day.
Sprinkle, do you want to

5747
03:48:21.200 --> 03:48:22.710 line:15%
stay with me or do you want to

5748
03:48:22.710 --> 03:48:24.917 line:15%
live the life of a wild creature?

5749
03:48:24.917 --> 03:48:27.001 line:15%
(throat clearing)

5750
03:48:27.001 --> 03:48:29.101 line:15%
Should we make a hut?
Let's make a hut.

5751
03:48:30.286 --> 03:48:32.496 line:15%
She doesn't wait for an answer. (laughs)

5752
03:48:32.496 --> 03:48:33.329 line:15%
Just make a hut.

5753
03:48:33.329 --> 03:48:35.075 line:15%
(laughing)

5754
03:48:35.075 --> 03:48:36.630 line:15%
Yeah, you can set up.
Okay.

5755
03:48:36.630 --> 03:48:37.750 line:15%
But after clearing the space a bit

5756
03:48:37.750 --> 03:48:39.020 line:15%
and by the time you get ready for it,

5757
03:48:39.020 --> 03:48:40.300 line:15%
you are losing the last bit of daylight,

5758
03:48:40.300 --> 03:48:42.890 line:15%
so the timing's pretty perfect, actually.

5759
03:48:42.890 --> 03:48:47.020 line:15%
As Caleb is preparing, I'll take a little sip of whiskey.

5760
03:48:47.890 --> 03:48:50.733 line:15%
No, no.
I knock it out.

5761
03:48:50.733 --> 03:48:54.030 line:15%
Wait, what?

5762
03:48:54.030 --> 03:48:57.990 line:15%
I backhand your flask.

5763
03:48:57.990 --> 03:49:01.380 line:15%
I dodge it.
Roll an attack roll.

5764
03:49:02.483 --> 03:49:03.325 line:15%
(chair thumping)

5765
03:49:03.325 --> 03:49:05.470 line:15%
Reckless.
You can be reckless

5766
03:49:05.470 --> 03:49:07.100 line:15%
if you want to.
Oh, yeah,

5767
03:49:07.100 --> 03:49:08.520 line:15%
yeah yeah yeah, of course.

5768
03:49:09.790 --> 03:49:11.316 line:15%
Oh wait, what was that?

5769
03:49:11.316 --> 03:49:12.630 line:15%
(dice clattering)

5770
03:49:12.630 --> 03:49:13.900 line:15%
Oh yeah.

5771
03:49:13.900 --> 03:49:15.340 line:15%
(snorting)

5772
03:49:15.340 --> 03:49:16.173 line:15%
22.

5773
03:49:18.018 --> 03:49:20.364 line:15%
I mean, that hits, yeah.
Yeah.

5774
03:49:20.364 --> 03:49:21.531 line:15%
(yelling)

5775
03:49:21.531 --> 03:49:22.528 line:15%
(laughing)

5776
03:49:22.528 --> 03:49:24.040 line:15%
(whooshing)
(pinging)

5777
03:49:24.040 --> 03:49:26.550 line:15%
It lands a little ways off.
I pick it up.

5778
03:49:34.574 --> 03:49:36.120 line:15%
Ooh.
You told me to do it.

5779
03:49:36.120 --> 03:49:38.470 line:15%
I was just sort of kidding.
You weren't.

5780
03:49:38.470 --> 03:49:41.340 line:15%
No, you weren't kidding.
Not at all.

5781
03:49:41.340 --> 03:49:42.500 line:15%
We're keeping you accountable.

5782
03:49:42.500 --> 03:49:44.070 line:15%
All right, good.
We're a tribe now.

5783
03:49:44.070 --> 03:49:45.720 line:15%
That was a test and you passed.

5784
03:49:47.370 --> 03:49:49.280 line:15%
Okay, well do you want a sip for being good?

5785
03:49:49.280 --> 03:49:51.791 line:15%
Yes.
That was a test.

5786
03:49:51.791 --> 03:49:52.624 line:15%
(laughing)

5787
03:49:52.624 --> 03:49:53.760 line:15%
You failed.
Okay.

5788
03:49:53.760 --> 03:49:55.837 line:15%
I put it in my bag.

5789
03:49:55.837 --> 03:49:56.906 line:15%
(laughing)

5790
03:49:56.906 --> 03:49:58.816 line:15%
(clapping)

5791
03:49:58.816 --> 03:50:01.110 line:15%
Beautiful.
I love all of this.

5792
03:50:01.110 --> 03:50:01.943 line:15%
Alrighty.

5793
03:50:03.716 --> 03:50:05.650 line:15%
You set up the dome without issue.

5794
03:50:06.791 --> 03:50:08.680 line:15%
The nocturnal beasts of the night begin to

5795
03:50:08.680 --> 03:50:10.890 line:15%
go about their evening hunt and you can hear

5796
03:50:10.890 --> 03:50:15.890 line:15%
the distant sounds of creatures you aren't familiar with

5797
03:50:16.401 --> 03:50:18.760 line:15%
(birds tweeting)

5798
03:50:18.760 --> 03:50:20.320 line:15%
kind of growling,

5799
03:50:22.210 --> 03:50:25.740 line:15%
purring, making calls to each other in the distance.

5800
03:50:26.680 --> 03:50:28.300 line:15%
It's unsettling but you feel comfortable here--

5801
03:50:28.300 --> 03:50:29.910 line:15%
Making calls to each other in the distance.

5802
03:50:29.910 --> 03:50:30.850 line:15%
Hello?
Hey.

5803
03:50:31.932 --> 03:50:34.160 line:15%
I'm just real curious how your night's been over there

5804
03:50:34.160 --> 03:50:36.630 line:15%
'cause it's real heavy over where I live.

5805
03:50:36.630 --> 03:50:38.942 line:15%
Do you hear all these bugs?

5806
03:50:38.942 --> 03:50:40.686 line:15%
(laughing)

5807
03:50:40.686 --> 03:50:41.539 line:15%
Mom?

5808
03:50:41.539 --> 03:50:43.110 line:15%
(laughing)

5809
03:50:43.110 --> 03:50:45.399 line:15%
But who's taking first watch?

5810
03:50:45.399 --> 03:50:46.340 line:15%
If you're taking any watches or if

5811
03:50:46.340 --> 03:50:47.340 line:15%
you guys just all going to sleep.

5812
03:50:47.340 --> 03:50:48.570 line:15%
You feel pretty comfortable but it's up to you.

5813
03:50:48.570 --> 03:50:50.480 line:15%
I'm gonna stay up for just a little bit

5814
03:50:50.480 --> 03:50:52.710 line:15%
and I'm gonna draw, I'm gonna take out

5815
03:50:52.710 --> 03:50:54.820 line:15%
Molly's tarot deck.
Mmkay.

5816
03:50:54.820 --> 03:50:56.820 line:15%
And I'm gonna draw on one of the cards.

5817
03:50:56.820 --> 03:50:59.720 line:15%
I've thought of one of the cards that I want to make.

5818
03:50:59.720 --> 03:51:00.770 line:15%
Ooh.
Okay.

5819
03:51:00.770 --> 03:51:02.920 line:15%
What is it?
On one,

5820
03:51:02.920 --> 03:51:05.870 line:15%
so you know that optical illusion where one side looks like

5821
03:51:05.870 --> 03:51:07.410 line:15%
a old lady and you flip it and it's like

5822
03:51:07.410 --> 03:51:09.180 line:15%
a pretty woman?
Uh huh.

5823
03:51:09.180 --> 03:51:10.180 line:15%
You know what I'm talkin' about?

5824
03:51:10.180 --> 03:51:11.013 line:15%
Yeah, yeah.
I'm gonna make

5825
03:51:11.013 --> 03:51:13.610 line:15%
a dual card and one side's going to be the hag

5826
03:51:13.610 --> 03:51:16.040 line:15%
and then when you flip it over, it's the maiden.

5827
03:51:16.040 --> 03:51:17.070 line:15%
Ooh.
Oh.

5828
03:51:17.070 --> 03:51:20.110 line:15%
That's hot.
And so that card's

5829
03:51:20.110 --> 03:51:22.470 line:15%
called The Hag and Maiden?
The Hag and the Maiden.

5830
03:51:22.470 --> 03:51:24.030 line:15%
They each have two names.
Do they look like you?

5831
03:51:24.030 --> 03:51:26.071 line:15%
That's very cool.
Maybe.

5832
03:51:26.071 --> 03:51:28.180 line:15%
(laughing)

5833
03:51:28.180 --> 03:51:31.400 line:15%
She may be like a little blue color in the folds.

5834
03:51:32.263 --> 03:51:34.840 line:15%
That's good, that's good.
All right.

5835
03:51:34.840 --> 03:51:37.010 line:15%
I have a quick thing I want to do before bed as well.

5836
03:51:37.010 --> 03:51:38.890 line:15%
I'm not taking a watch, or maybe I will,

5837
03:51:38.890 --> 03:51:42.550 line:15%
but I get out the ingredients I need to cast Find Familiar

5838
03:51:42.550 --> 03:51:45.982 line:15%
and I place my raven cat down in the center

5839
03:51:45.982 --> 03:51:48.790 line:15%
and mutter a few words and spend the time on it.

5840
03:51:48.790 --> 03:51:50.630 line:15%
Oh, it takes an hour--
It takes an hour.

5841
03:51:50.630 --> 03:51:52.010 line:15%
And 10 minutes.

5842
03:51:52.010 --> 03:51:56.360 line:15%
And suddenly I have a small capuchin monkey.

5843
03:51:56.360 --> 03:51:57.193 line:15%
Ooh.
Okay.

5844
03:51:57.193 --> 03:51:58.759 line:15%
With--
Ooh.

5845
03:51:58.759 --> 03:51:59.592 line:15%
Little speckled spots all over him.

5846
03:51:59.592 --> 03:52:01.210 line:15%
Cool.
Alrighty.

5847
03:52:01.210 --> 03:52:03.512 line:15%
Slick, slick slick slick.

5848
03:52:03.512 --> 03:52:06.977 line:15%
You see Sprinkle try to escape the dome.

5849
03:52:06.977 --> 03:52:09.096 line:15%
I volunteer as tribute.

5850
03:52:09.096 --> 03:52:10.102 line:15%
(laughing)

5851
03:52:10.102 --> 03:52:11.751 line:15%
(imitated scrabbling)

5852
03:52:11.751 --> 03:52:14.059 line:15%
It does not have the passcode to come back in, so.

5853
03:52:14.059 --> 03:52:15.287 line:15%
(laughing)

5854
03:52:15.287 --> 03:52:19.010 line:15%
Sprinkle is curled up, comfortable, in my hood,

5855
03:52:19.010 --> 03:52:21.960 line:15%
a little unnerved by all of the crazy noises.

5856
03:52:21.960 --> 03:52:24.113 line:15%
A little unnerved.
Yeah.

5857
03:52:24.113 --> 03:52:25.294 line:15%
(laughing)

5858
03:52:25.294 --> 03:52:26.864 line:15%
New development.
So,

5859
03:52:26.864 --> 03:52:29.690 line:15%
you finish summoning your monkey and go to bed.

5860
03:52:29.690 --> 03:52:31.050 line:15%
You're finishing the card--

5861
03:52:31.050 --> 03:52:33.164 line:15%
Summoning the monkey all night long.

5862
03:52:33.164 --> 03:52:35.414 line:15%
(laughing)

5863
03:52:36.595 --> 03:52:37.432 line:15%
(snorting)

5864
03:52:37.432 --> 03:52:39.682 line:15%
(laughing)

5865
03:52:40.823 --> 03:52:41.656 line:15%
Wizard shit.

5866
03:52:41.656 --> 03:52:43.060 line:15%
Every Wizard's early days at school,

5867
03:52:43.060 --> 03:52:44.510 line:15%
(laughing)

5868
03:52:44.510 --> 03:52:46.127 line:15%
spend a little too much time summonin' the monkey.

5869
03:52:46.127 --> 03:52:48.193 line:15%
(laughing)

5870
03:52:48.193 --> 03:52:49.026 line:15%
All right.

5871
03:52:50.340 --> 03:52:51.940 line:15%
But Jester, you're taking the first watch?

5872
03:52:51.940 --> 03:52:53.623 line:15%
Mm, mm hm.
Yup.

5873
03:52:53.623 --> 03:52:57.157 line:15%
Mm hm.
'Kay.

5874
03:52:57.157 --> 03:52:58.420 line:15%
(whistling)

5875
03:52:58.420 --> 03:52:59.570 line:15%
Everyone else is asleep

5876
03:53:00.452 --> 03:53:02.020 line:15%
(whistling)

5877
03:53:02.020 --> 03:53:05.440 line:15%
for the early portion of the night.

5878
03:53:09.520 --> 03:53:12.120 line:15%
In that time that you're finishing your card drawing

5879
03:53:13.326 --> 03:53:14.340 line:15%
and getting excited,

5880
03:53:18.426 --> 03:53:19.259 line:15%
you can't help but kind of

5881
03:53:20.150 --> 03:53:22.193 line:15%
catch something in the corner of your eye

5882
03:53:23.610 --> 03:53:27.840 line:15%
and outside of the dome, beyond the edge of the glade,

5883
03:53:29.540 --> 03:53:32.422 line:15%
you see a familiar green robe.

5884
03:53:32.422 --> 03:53:35.005 line:15%
(gentle music)

5885
03:53:43.637 --> 03:53:45.450 line:15%
I get up and go.
Okay.

5886
03:53:48.324 --> 03:53:49.220 line:15%
This is bad, right?

5887
03:53:49.220 --> 03:53:50.815 line:15%
No?
I think it's fine.

5888
03:53:50.815 --> 03:53:51.768 line:15%
No, it's fine.

5889
03:53:51.768 --> 03:53:52.780 line:15%
They're just gonna go fuck in the woods.

5890
03:53:52.780 --> 03:53:57.070 line:15%
You step out of the dome and quietly make your way

5891
03:53:57.070 --> 03:53:59.480 line:15%
beyond the clearing where--
What're you doing?

5892
03:53:59.480 --> 03:54:00.880 line:15%
The Traveler waits as you.

5893
03:54:02.420 --> 03:54:03.253 line:15%
Come with me.

5894
03:54:04.970 --> 03:54:08.930 line:15%
You've always been so quick to learn, so very clever.

5895
03:54:10.390 --> 03:54:11.260 line:15%
I grow so proud.

5896
03:54:13.313 --> 03:54:14.440 line:15%
I think it's time.
Time for what?

5897
03:54:16.820 --> 03:54:21.730 line:15%
Do you trust me?
With everything in my being.

5898
03:54:24.439 --> 03:54:25.362 line:15%
Come.

5899
03:54:25.362 --> 03:54:27.030 line:15%
And he turns and walks further into

5900
03:54:27.030 --> 03:54:29.620 line:15%
the darkness of the jungle, a faint kinda green glow

5901
03:54:29.620 --> 03:54:32.060 line:15%
lighting up the space around him as he walks.

5902
03:54:33.590 --> 03:54:38.030 line:15%
I glance back at the dome and take off after

5903
03:54:38.030 --> 03:54:39.130 line:15%
the Traveler.
Okay.

5904
03:54:41.740 --> 03:54:44.150 line:15%
As he walks, you can see kind of out of

5905
03:54:44.150 --> 03:54:46.350 line:15%
the corner of the green light,

5906
03:54:46.350 --> 03:54:51.350 line:15%
the vines almost expanding and growing more vibrant

5907
03:54:52.100 --> 03:54:56.910 line:15%
around him, flowers kind of (make poofing noises).

5908
03:54:58.590 --> 03:55:00.750 line:15%
As he steps to an area and kind of

5909
03:55:00.750 --> 03:55:02.460 line:15%
puts his hand to one side, you can see

5910
03:55:02.460 --> 03:55:07.460 line:15%
one of the trees kind of very quietly bends and moves aside

5911
03:55:08.580 --> 03:55:13.580 line:15%
where a little corner of the jungle is kind of serene

5912
03:55:13.860 --> 03:55:17.160 line:15%
and removed from the dense expanse

5913
03:55:17.160 --> 03:55:20.580 line:15%
around you.
Wow.

5914
03:55:20.580 --> 03:55:21.900 line:15%
Is this the oasis?

5915
03:55:22.900 --> 03:55:27.110 line:15%
No, this is your oasis.
It's a place to talk.

5916
03:55:32.530 --> 03:55:34.120 line:15%
He stands and turns facing you.

5917
03:55:38.370 --> 03:55:40.109 line:15%
And he pulls his hood back,

5918
03:55:40.109 --> 03:55:41.560 line:15%
(gasping)

5919
03:55:41.560 --> 03:55:44.950 line:15%
revealing his almost elf-like features,

5920
03:55:44.950 --> 03:55:49.150 line:15%
but more exaggerated and fey, his long ears

5921
03:55:49.150 --> 03:55:54.150 line:15%
curling behind the head, beyond any elf's that you've seen,

5922
03:55:54.520 --> 03:55:58.200 line:15%
his almond-shaped eyes of emerald green and brilliant

5923
03:55:58.200 --> 03:56:00.870 line:15%
beneath these thin feather-like brows.

5924
03:56:01.910 --> 03:56:05.580 line:15%
A voluminous orange-red hair curls down the back of

5925
03:56:05.580 --> 03:56:08.930 line:15%
the head like a lion's mane and he smiles.

5926
03:56:11.750 --> 03:56:15.840 line:15%
Jester, you are my first disciple,

5927
03:56:17.630 --> 03:56:19.430 line:15%
the first one to truly carve the world

5928
03:56:19.430 --> 03:56:23.190 line:15%
with your cunning, your joy, and your mischief.

5929
03:56:25.590 --> 03:56:26.423 line:15%
I trust you.

5930
03:56:27.730 --> 03:56:29.780 line:15%
And are you ready for the absolute truth?

5931
03:56:33.310 --> 03:56:34.143 line:15%
Yes?

5932
03:56:35.800 --> 03:56:40.170 line:15%
I am the Traveler but it was not always this way,

5933
03:56:42.550 --> 03:56:46.140 line:15%
for when I traveled here, it was a world before me

5934
03:56:47.080 --> 03:56:49.310 line:15%
where I was without burdens,

5935
03:56:49.310 --> 03:56:53.220 line:15%
without responsibilities, and without limitations.

5936
03:56:55.110 --> 03:56:56.610 line:15%
I drank deep of the muted colors

5937
03:56:56.610 --> 03:57:00.150 line:15%
of Exandria, straining to exit.

5938
03:57:01.900 --> 03:57:04.530 line:15%
I plucked at and knotted the lives of many fools

5939
03:57:04.530 --> 03:57:07.490 line:15%
from the shadows, amusing myself by

5940
03:57:07.490 --> 03:57:09.790 line:15%
leaping into every whim with glee and purpose.

5941
03:57:11.630 --> 03:57:15.590 line:15%
And one day, I met a little girl who sought that same spark,

5942
03:57:18.270 --> 03:57:20.420 line:15%
a little girl who found joy in exposing life's

5943
03:57:20.420 --> 03:57:24.340 line:15%
most subtle hypocrisies, a little blue girl

5944
03:57:24.340 --> 03:57:27.260 line:15%
who lived a life so small but felt in her heart

5945
03:57:27.260 --> 03:57:28.760 line:15%
there was so much more to see.

5946
03:57:31.860 --> 03:57:33.760 line:15%
This little girl and I found a kinship

5947
03:57:35.060 --> 03:57:39.250 line:15%
and in her child-like wonder, her view so untempered by

5948
03:57:39.250 --> 03:57:44.040 line:15%
the sanctimonious morality of man, and she saw me as a god.

5949
03:57:46.010 --> 03:57:51.010 line:15%
So, for her, for you, I donned the mask of one.

5950
03:57:56.020 --> 03:57:59.060 line:15%
I found that with such pure, absolute faith

5951
03:57:59.060 --> 03:58:01.510 line:15%
granted towards me, I was exhilarated.

5952
03:58:02.770 --> 03:58:05.310 line:15%
I began to seek others who might be

5953
03:58:05.310 --> 03:58:08.310 line:15%
waiting for such guidance, to bring a bit of,

5954
03:58:09.670 --> 03:58:12.090 line:15%
well, necessary chaos into the world.

5955
03:58:13.860 --> 03:58:16.240 line:15%
One by one, I traveled and found

5956
03:58:16.240 --> 03:58:18.410 line:15%
more souls who needed direction,

5957
03:58:18.410 --> 03:58:21.930 line:15%
who found themselves in our shenanigans.

5958
03:58:23.330 --> 03:58:24.180 line:15%
It was beautiful.

5959
03:58:26.000 --> 03:58:29.150 line:15%
Eons of living for only myself, I found a new joy

5960
03:58:29.150 --> 03:58:31.490 line:15%
in helping others find themselves in a world

5961
03:58:31.490 --> 03:58:35.450 line:15%
cruel and painted in dull, divided pigments.

5962
03:58:36.730 --> 03:58:39.040 line:15%
With each new faith, I confined myself,

5963
03:58:40.420 --> 03:58:42.910 line:15%
I could feel myself becoming what you believed.

5964
03:58:44.279 --> 03:58:46.862 line:15%
(gentle music)

5965
03:58:48.160 --> 03:58:48.993 line:15%
Then more came.

5966
03:58:50.720 --> 03:58:52.570 line:15%
Playful pranks turned into demands,

5967
03:58:53.840 --> 03:58:56.000 line:15%
prayers fighting for my attention.

5968
03:58:57.010 --> 03:58:59.680 line:15%
Freshly freed from previously imposed boundaries,

5969
03:58:59.680 --> 03:59:01.956 line:15%
I had managed to really construct my own.

5970
03:59:01.956 --> 03:59:03.740 line:15%
While such faith granted me power

5971
03:59:03.740 --> 03:59:06.260 line:15%
beyond what I thought possible to achieve,

5972
03:59:07.300 --> 03:59:08.850 line:15%
I was being spread too thin across

5973
03:59:08.850 --> 03:59:10.590 line:15%
those who I'd taken under my wing.

5974
03:59:12.380 --> 03:59:14.610 line:15%
I thought to bring them all together,

5975
03:59:14.610 --> 03:59:17.580 line:15%
to unify their causes and perhaps forge a community

5976
03:59:17.580 --> 03:59:21.040 line:15%
under this banner, my banner, our banner.

5977
03:59:22.100 --> 03:59:24.980 line:15%
We are weeks away from the gathering of my lost children

5978
03:59:24.980 --> 03:59:28.710 line:15%
who have wound their lives around my boons and counsel.

5979
03:59:30.490 --> 03:59:35.205 line:15%
The truth, Jester, is that I have no idea what I'm doing

5980
03:59:35.205 --> 03:59:36.210 line:15%
(gasping)

5981
03:59:36.210 --> 03:59:37.260 line:15%
and I need your help.

5982
03:59:39.140 --> 03:59:40.558 line:15%
That's where it ends tonight's episode.

5983
03:59:40.558 --> 03:59:42.126 line:15%
(yelling)

5984
03:59:42.126 --> 03:59:44.253 line:15%
(clapping)

5985
03:59:44.253 --> 03:59:46.252 line:15%
Holy shit. (laughs)

5986
03:59:46.252 --> 03:59:47.272 line:15%
(talking over each other)

5987
03:59:47.272 --> 03:59:48.269 line:15%
Fuck off, David Bowie!

5988
03:59:48.269 --> 03:59:49.690 line:15%
Fuck off, no one wants you here, David Bowie.

5989
03:59:49.690 --> 03:59:50.526 line:15%
(laughing)

5990
03:59:50.526 --> 03:59:51.535 line:15%
Oh my god.

5991
03:59:51.535 --> 03:59:52.530 line:15%
Go back to your home, David Bowie.

5992
03:59:52.530 --> 03:59:56.940 line:15%
It's a cult.
It is a cult.

5993
03:59:56.940 --> 04:00:00.784 line:15%
This was Jester's fault the whole time.

5994
04:00:00.784 --> 04:00:02.140 line:15%
(clapping)

5995
04:00:02.140 --> 04:00:04.220 line:15%
Maybe not a cult--
Yes.

5996
04:00:04.220 --> 04:00:05.360 line:15%
It's a cult!
No,

5997
04:00:05.360 --> 04:00:06.880 line:15%
now he's gonna be a god, he is a god.

5998
04:00:06.880 --> 04:00:08.940 line:15%
There's paper pants, it's a cult.

5999
04:00:08.940 --> 04:00:11.362 line:15%
Elven futures--
It's Artagan!

6000
04:00:11.362 --> 04:00:14.190 line:15%
It's Artagan.
Totally Artagan.

6001
04:00:14.190 --> 04:00:15.380 line:15%
Come on.
Totally.

6002
04:00:15.380 --> 04:00:16.420 line:15%
You're saying yes?

6003
04:00:16.420 --> 04:00:18.060 line:15%
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Yeah.

6004
04:00:18.060 --> 04:00:19.621 line:15%
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah.

6005
04:00:19.621 --> 04:00:21.340 line:15%
(dice clattering)

6006
04:00:21.340 --> 04:00:23.890 line:15%
Holy shit--
Maybe it's not a cult.

6007
04:00:23.890 --> 04:00:26.150 line:15%
David Bowie, just David Bowie.

6008
04:00:26.150 --> 04:00:28.860 line:15%
I have no idea what I'm doing?

6009
04:00:30.200 --> 04:00:31.380 line:15%
Oh no.

6010
04:00:32.220 --> 04:00:33.880 line:15%
Honestly, if I were ever to meet a god

6011
04:00:33.880 --> 04:00:35.020 line:15%
and they said that to me, I'd be like,

6012
04:00:35.020 --> 04:00:36.887 line:15%
"Okay, and now I believe that you are."

6013
04:00:36.887 --> 04:00:37.867 line:15%
(laughing)

6014
04:00:37.867 --> 04:00:40.430 line:15%
(clapping)

6015
04:00:40.430 --> 04:00:41.750 line:15%
This got way outta hand.

6016
04:00:43.337 --> 04:00:46.160 line:15%
Traveler Con is just Artagan strangling 500 people.

6017
04:00:47.078 --> 04:00:48.140 line:15%
(laughs) I mean--

6018
04:00:48.140 --> 04:00:50.800 line:15%
Wait, do I really, Artagan, Arta, there was--

6019
04:00:50.800 --> 04:00:52.662 line:15%
Yeah.
Ar-tah-gan or Are-tai-gan?

6020
04:00:52.662 --> 04:00:53.600 line:15%
Ar-tai-gan.
Artagan, Garmelie,

6021
04:00:53.600 --> 04:00:56.864 line:15%
and then it was like binding was actually Artagan--

6022
04:00:56.864 --> 04:00:58.834 line:15%
Right, Garmelie was like the faun father--

6023
04:00:58.834 --> 04:01:00.100 line:15%
Yeah yeah yeah yeah.
Oh my god, oh.

6024
04:01:00.100 --> 04:01:01.220 line:15%
Holy.
So much--

6025
04:01:01.220 --> 04:01:02.850 line:15%
For so long, just--
Garmelie was the faun.

6026
04:01:02.850 --> 04:01:04.140 line:15%
Was that an illusion for us?

6027
04:01:04.140 --> 04:01:06.080 line:15%
Yeah yeah yeah, it was like his changed shape.

6028
04:01:06.080 --> 04:01:07.110 line:15%
Yep.
Little trickster faun.

6029
04:01:07.110 --> 04:01:09.060 line:15%
Yeah.
Oh fuck.

6030
04:01:09.060 --> 04:01:11.470 line:15%
You did this, I'm so excited.

6031
04:01:11.470 --> 04:01:12.831 line:15%
You did this.

6032
04:01:12.831 --> 04:01:13.914 line:15%
(talking over each other)

6033
04:01:13.914 --> 04:01:16.300 line:15%
You did this.
(laughs) It's so funny.

6034
04:01:16.300 --> 04:01:18.530 line:15%
It doesn't necessarily need to be a bad thing.

6035
04:01:18.530 --> 04:01:20.720 line:15%
No, it's not, it's super awesome.

6036
04:01:20.720 --> 04:01:22.470 line:15%
It's a clusterfuck.

6037
04:01:22.470 --> 04:01:24.380 line:15%
It's a complicated thing, is what it is.

6038
04:01:24.380 --> 04:01:26.220 line:15%
It's a club that you've started.

6039
04:01:26.220 --> 04:01:28.680 line:15%
You started a club.
You did.

6040
04:01:28.680 --> 04:01:30.840 line:15%
You started a club, maybe you become, maybe--

6041
04:01:30.840 --> 04:01:32.100 line:15%
Married to somebody and then found

6042
04:01:32.100 --> 04:01:34.233 line:15%
the secret door to their basement.

6043
04:01:34.233 --> 04:01:35.066 line:15%
(laughing)

6044
04:01:35.066 --> 04:01:36.745 line:15%
Oh my gosh.

6045
04:01:36.745 --> 04:01:37.898
No.

6046
04:01:37.898 --> 04:01:38.731
(laughing)

6047
04:01:38.731 --> 04:01:39.564
It's so much more.

6048
04:01:39.564 --> 04:01:42.500
No, this is fine.
It's so amazing.

6049
04:01:42.500 --> 04:01:44.790
It's totally okay.
Yup.

6050
04:01:44.790 --> 04:01:47.680
It was the trigger of your trickery last session

6051
04:01:47.680 --> 04:01:50.507
that he was like, "Okay, maybe she can help me."

6052
04:01:50.507 --> 04:01:52.510
(laughing)

6053
04:01:52.510 --> 04:01:54.570
Oh my god.
Holy fuck.

6054
04:01:54.570 --> 04:01:56.320
Shit.
I love it.

6055
04:01:56.320 --> 04:01:58.170
I love it so much.

6056
04:01:58.170 --> 04:02:01.360
Oh my god.
It's gon' be interesting.

6057
04:02:01.360 --> 04:02:03.930
But we'll pick that up next week on Thursday.

6058
04:02:07.070 --> 04:02:08.780
Thank you for joining us.

6059
04:02:08.780 --> 04:02:12.360
Look forward to seeing you guys next Thursday

6060
04:02:12.360 --> 04:02:15.060

6062
04:02:18.140 --> 04:02:20.690
