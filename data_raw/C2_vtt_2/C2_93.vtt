00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:02.090
MATT: Hello, everyone, and welcome to tonight's episode

2
00:00:02.090 --> 00:00:03.120
of Critical Role, where a bunch

3
00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:04.250
of us nerdy-ass voice actors sit around

4
00:00:04.250 --> 00:00:05.390
and play Dungeons &amp; Dragons.

5
00:00:05.390 --> 00:00:09.090
TRAVIS and ASHLEY: We play Dungeons &amp; Dragons!

6
00:00:10.233 --> 00:00:11.482
MATT: That was a thinner one this week.

7
00:00:11.482 --> 00:00:12.530
LAURA: Yeah.

8
00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:13.390
TRAVIS: People bailed on me.

9
00:00:13.390 --> 00:00:15.227
MATT: Yeah, your friends abandoned you on that.

10
00:00:15.227 --> 00:00:17.187
ASHLEY: I was with you.
TRAVIS: Thank you.

11
00:00:17.187 --> 00:00:18.580
(laughter)

12
00:00:18.580 --> 00:00:19.560
TALIESIN: In spirit.

13
00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:21.640
MATT: So before we get into tonight's session,

14
00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:22.860
we have some announcements to get through,

15
00:00:22.860 --> 00:00:26.400
beginning with two sponsors for the evening.

16
00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:28.900
First up, we have a new sponsor for the show,

17
00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:32.520
specifically Knights of Pen &amp; Paper II.

18
00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:34.160
Sam!

19
00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:38.610
SAM: Raise rise up, for it is I Drak'ar Noir

20
00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:40.580
from the Fantasy Ranch.

21
00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:42.020
You may have seen me

22
00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:45.480
on Travis Willingham's Yee-Haw Game Ranch,

23
00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:47.810
where I survived the cabbage stench

24
00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:51.184
of that ill-bred, yeasty canker sore Brian Foster!

25
00:00:51.184 --> 00:00:52.458
ASHLEY: (laughing)
TRAVIS: Oh boy.

26
00:00:52.458 --> 00:00:55.990
SAM: But tonight, I shall raise
rise up for our sponsor,

27
00:00:55.990 --> 00:00:57.150
the critically acclaimed,

28
00:00:57.150 --> 00:01:00.000
turn-based pixel art adventure game,

29
00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.181
Knights of Pen &amp; Paper II.

30
00:01:02.181 --> 00:01:05.230
(cheering)

31
00:01:05.230 --> 00:01:08.760
In Fantasy Ranch, we are
addicted to this retro-style game,

32
00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:10.730
which simulates the classic pen-and-paper,

33
00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:13.400
role-playing experience with satire and humor

34
00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:16.540
and feels like you're sitting
at the table with friends.

35
00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:19.820
And now I will sing its praises, literally,

36
00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:23.269
with a song our finest bards
composed for the occasion.

37
00:01:23.269 --> 00:01:24.327
TRAVIS: Oh no!
LAURA: Oh-- (laughs)

38
00:01:24.327 --> 00:01:25.462
MARISHA: Yes.
TALIESIN: Yeah!

39
00:01:25.462 --> 00:01:27.461

40
00:01:27.461 --> 00:01:30.150
SAM: A little bit of an intro (coughs).

MATT: I think it's the best facet
of Sam we could ever enjoy.

67
00:02:37.698 --> 00:02:39.170
TRAVIS: Oh my god.
MATT: Thank you, Sam,

68
00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:42.180
and thank you, Knights of Pen &amp; Paper II.

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:44.980

70
00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:47.050

who haven't heard us sing
their praises before,

75
00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:54.850

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:12.360
I'm going to be thorough in
my announcement there.

85
00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:13.990

90
00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:22.390
Bring it down.

91
00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:23.650
Yeah, thank you, guys at D&amp;D Beyond,

92
00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:25.470
for continuing to support the show.

93
00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:28.020
We have a couple of announcements.

94
00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:29.880
Oh, earlier this week, if you guys haven't seen it,

95
00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:32.023
we announced our live show in Chicago.

96
00:03:32.023 --> 00:03:35.460
TRAVIS: ♪ In Chicago, Chicago ♪
ASHLEY: Yay, Chi-Town!

97
00:03:35.460 --> 00:03:38.350
MATT: Leading into our appearance at C2E2

98
00:03:38.350 --> 00:03:40.580
at the end of next month,
the Thursday, February 27th,

99
00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:43.070
at the Auditorium Theatre in Chicago.

100
00:03:43.070 --> 00:03:46.660
We're going to have a live, in-canon episode

101
00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:49.350
for anyone who's in the
region and wants to come see.

102
00:03:49.350 --> 00:03:52.870
Tickets are on sale, VIP tickets
will go on sale Wednesday,

103
00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:56.410
and February 5th at 10 a.m. Central,

104
00:03:56.410 --> 00:03:59.470
the regular tickets will be on sale.

105
00:03:59.470 --> 00:04:00.790
Oh, sorry, let me get that back.

106
00:04:00.790 --> 00:04:01.790
This sentence was--

107
00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:04.580
VIP tickets will be on sale
Wednesday, February 5th,

108
00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:06.090
at 10 a.m Central, there we go,

109
00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:08.410
and regular tickets will be on sale
Thursday, February 6th,

110
00:04:08.410 --> 00:04:09.910
at 10 a.m. Central, so day after day.

111
00:04:09.910 --> 00:04:13.100
I should read the right order
in the sentences there.

112
00:04:13.100 --> 00:04:16.240
But if you can't attend our
show, that's totally fine.

113
00:04:16.240 --> 00:04:18.880
Our broadcast on the 27th
will start an hour earlier,

114
00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:20.130
because we'll be doing it live from there.

115
00:04:20.130 --> 00:04:20.990
So it'll be at 6 p.m.

116
00:04:20.990 --> 00:04:23.920
as opposed to 7 p.m. Pacific, that Thursday.

117
00:04:25.010 --> 00:04:26.150
So be ready for that.

118
00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:27.390
Put it in your calendar for those who want

119
00:04:27.390 --> 00:04:29.300
to be there for it live.

120
00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:30.380

121
00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:33.005

122
00:04:33.005 --> 00:04:34.740
TRAVIS: It's a really pretty theater, you guys.

123
00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:37.688
LAURA: Yeah, it's a really pretty theater.
TRAVIS: Historic.

124
00:04:37.688 --> 00:04:38.827
ASHLEY: The Stork?

125
00:04:38.827 --> 00:04:40.464
TRAVIS: Historic!
LIAM: Historic!

126
00:04:40.464 --> 00:04:42.190
(laughter)

127
00:04:42.190 --> 00:04:44.168
ASHLEY: I was like, what a
strange name for a theater!

128
00:04:44.168 --> 00:04:45.559
(laughter)

129
00:04:45.559 --> 00:04:47.808
TRAVIS: It's their mascot
LIAM: The stork.

130
00:04:49.879 --> 00:04:52.062
MARISHA: Go to a show, in nine
months you have a baby.

131
00:04:52.062 --> 00:04:53.147
TALIESIN: Yeah.
ASHLEY: I'll leave.

132
00:04:53.147 --> 00:04:54.855
MATT: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
TALIESIN: A lot of nooks and crannies

133
00:04:54.855 --> 00:04:58.304
at the Stork, a lot of dark corners.

134
00:04:58.304 --> 00:04:59.630
MARISHA: [JENGA] and drink.

135
00:04:59.630 --> 00:05:01.931
(laughter)
MATT: All righty.

136
00:05:01.931 --> 00:05:04.680
In case you also missed the news earlier today,

137
00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:06.470
we have a non-fiction book

138
00:05:06.470 --> 00:05:08.715
coming out now, announced.
TRAVIS: We do!

139
00:05:08.715 --> 00:05:09.806
TRAVIS: Woo!

140
00:05:09.806 --> 00:05:12.100
MATT: Our friends at Penguin
Ran-don House, Penguin Random--

141
00:05:12.100 --> 00:05:13.210
I can't talk today!

142
00:05:13.210 --> 00:05:15.400
Our friends at Penguin Random House.

143
00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:16.460
I have a problem with Penguin apparently,

144
00:05:16.460 --> 00:05:18.653
just like Benedict Cumberbatch.

145
00:05:18.653 --> 00:05:20.850
TRAVIS: Just say perpetual
advantage, perpetual advantage.

146
00:05:20.850 --> 00:05:22.815
MATT: Perpetual advantage.
TRAVIS: Yes, got it!

147
00:05:22.815 --> 00:05:24.058
Does that count?
MARISHA: Nailed it!

148
00:05:24.058 --> 00:05:25.420
Hell yeah!
TRAVIS: (grunts)

149
00:05:25.420 --> 00:05:26.812
All game.
MATT: I'm not the DM yet.

150
00:05:26.812 --> 00:05:28.695
I'm doing announcements.

151
00:05:28.695 --> 00:05:30.662
But yes, we have a non-fiction book

152
00:05:30.662 --> 00:05:32.070
called World of Critical Role.

153
00:05:32.070 --> 00:05:33.960
They've been working on for a while now with us,

154
00:05:33.960 --> 00:05:36.350
that just goes over, as opposed

155
00:05:36.350 --> 00:05:39.500
to in-canon stories and art books and such,

156
00:05:39.500 --> 00:05:43.560
this is a deep narrative
about how all this happened.

157
00:05:43.560 --> 00:05:45.387
It's a bunch of, like, really personal interviews

158
00:05:45.387 --> 00:05:48.940
about us, from point to point,
the entire weird reality

159
00:05:48.940 --> 00:05:52.315
that has led us here and beyond.

160
00:05:52.315 --> 00:05:54.410
It's already looking really cool.

161
00:05:54.410 --> 00:05:59.120
I believe it's coming out September in bookstores,

162
00:05:59.120 --> 00:06:01.170
local bookstores all over, but it
is available for pre-order now,

163
00:06:01.170 --> 00:06:03.055
if you're interested.

164
00:06:03.055 --> 00:06:04.310
For those of you in the US,

165
00:06:04.310 --> 00:06:06.050
Penguin Random House is
also offering a chance

166
00:06:06.050 --> 00:06:08.180
to get your name printed
in the book, apparently,

167
00:06:08.180 --> 00:06:09.670
which is kind of cool.

168
00:06:09.670 --> 00:06:11.780
So for all the details, head to critrole.com

169
00:06:11.780 --> 00:06:13.460
to check out more about it.

170
00:06:13.460 --> 00:06:15.160
Marisha, you have an announcement.

171
00:06:15.160 --> 00:06:17.401
MARISHA: Oh man, this Tuesday,

172
00:06:17.401 --> 00:06:18.520
TRAVIS: (laughs)

173
00:06:18.520 --> 00:06:21.830
MARISHA: All Work No Play, it's coming back.

174
00:06:21.830 --> 00:06:23.630
Get in here, Riegel.

175
00:06:23.630 --> 00:06:25.140
SAM: Wow!
MARISHA: Whoa!

176
00:06:25.140 --> 00:06:26.500
SAM: It's really coming back.

177
00:06:26.500 --> 00:06:27.940
MARISHA: It's really coming back.

178
00:06:27.940 --> 00:06:28.773
SAM: Wow!

179
00:06:28.773 --> 00:06:33.773
MARISHA: At 4 p.m. on our Twitch channel, the first episode.

180
00:06:33.990 --> 00:06:37.040
The boys dive into some chainsaw art.

181
00:06:37.040 --> 00:06:38.200
SAM: Oh, is that what we start with?

182
00:06:38.200 --> 00:06:40.350
MARISHA: You're starting with
chainsaw art with Julie Nathanson.

183
00:06:40.350 --> 00:06:43.080
SAM: We have all our digits still, spoiler.
LIAM: Is this a set up to a bit,

184
00:06:43.080 --> 00:06:44.890
or is it really coming back?

185
00:06:44.890 --> 00:06:45.740
MARISHA: No, it's really coming back.

186
00:06:45.740 --> 00:06:46.670
TALIESIN: Really.
MARISHA: I know.

187
00:06:46.670 --> 00:06:47.911
LIAM: I'll believe it when I see it.

188
00:06:47.911 --> 00:06:49.670
ASHLEY: What is chainsaw art,

189
00:06:49.670 --> 00:06:50.503
like with ice?

190
00:06:50.503 --> 00:06:53.230
MARISHA: You'll have to find out. This Tuesday!
LAURA: They legitimately play with chainsaws.

191
00:06:53.230 --> 00:06:55.650
SAM: Do you know what penis art is?

192
00:06:55.650 --> 00:06:58.190
ASHLEY: Absolutely.
SAM: It's kind of the same thing.

193
00:06:58.190 --> 00:06:59.220
MARISHA: 4:00pm!

194
00:07:01.200 --> 00:07:03.160
ASHLEY: Have you never been to my house?

195
00:07:03.160 --> 00:07:05.930
(laughter)

196
00:07:05.930 --> 00:07:08.600
TALIESIN: A lot of bedazzling.
ASHLEY: A lot of bedazzling.

197
00:07:08.600 --> 00:07:12.280
MARISHA: If you miss the live broadcast, as always,

198
00:07:12.280 --> 00:07:14.260
VOD's immediately on our Twitch,

199
00:07:14.260 --> 00:07:16.360
and then All Work No Play will be up

200
00:07:16.360 --> 00:07:18.650
on YouTube on Thursdays.

201
00:07:18.650 --> 00:07:19.590
SAM: Whew!

202
00:07:19.590 --> 00:07:20.423
LAURA: Tight.

203
00:07:20.423 --> 00:07:21.256
LIAM: Coming at ya.

204
00:07:21.256 --> 00:07:22.430
TRAVIS: I'm so excited.
SAM: I am too.

205
00:07:22.430 --> 00:07:23.755
TRAVIS: Number-one fan in the house.
SAM: That's right, you are.

206
00:07:23.755 --> 00:07:25.810
TRAVIS: I got a new hat and shirt and everything.

207
00:07:25.810 --> 00:07:27.735
LAURA: It's fun.
TRAVIS: I made a sign.

208
00:07:27.735 --> 00:07:29.390
LAURA: It's fun.
(laughter)

209
00:07:29.390 --> 00:07:30.440
TRAVIS: Studio audience for this show?

210
00:07:30.440 --> 00:07:31.992
LAURA: He literally wears it at home.

211
00:07:31.992 --> 00:07:32.930
TALIESIN: You're just going to stand on the corner,

212
00:07:32.930 --> 00:07:34.161
aren't you, with a sign, be very excited.

213
00:07:34.161 --> 00:07:34.994
TRAVIS: Woo!

214
00:07:34.994 --> 00:07:36.831
(laughter)

215
00:07:36.831 --> 00:07:37.844
TRAVIS: Woo-hoo!

216
00:07:37.844 --> 00:07:40.520
MARISHA: There's a thing in the break, right, Kyle?

217
00:07:40.520 --> 00:07:41.353
KYLE: Yup!

218
00:07:41.353 --> 00:07:42.186
MARISHA: Yeah, there's a thing in the break.

219
00:07:42.186 --> 00:07:43.880
TRAVIS: A thing in the break.
MARISHA: A teaser, so, yes.

220
00:07:43.880 --> 00:07:46.257
ASHLEY: Your runes actually say "all work, no play."

221
00:07:46.257 --> 00:07:50.080
(laughter)

222
00:07:50.080 --> 00:07:51.129
TRAVIS: Back to the shiz-ow.

223
00:07:51.129 --> 00:07:53.567
(laughter)

224
00:07:53.567 --> 00:07:54.721
MATT: (sighs)

225
00:07:54.721 --> 00:07:57.600
LIAM: By the way, my favorite puppet penis I saw

226
00:07:57.600 --> 00:07:59.706
at Ashley's is the Medusa,

227
00:07:59.706 --> 00:08:00.987
not to be missed.
ASHLEY: Yeah, it's great.

228
00:08:00.987 --> 00:08:03.229
You bedazzled it.
TALIESIN: I did.

229
00:08:03.229 --> 00:08:05.700
That was a fun afternoon into an evening.
ASHLEY: That was a fun afternoon.

230
00:08:05.700 --> 00:08:06.780
MATT: Yeah, no,

231
00:08:06.780 --> 00:08:08.850
that really carries the whole scale effect

232
00:08:08.850 --> 00:08:11.260
to a whole different level.
TALIESIN: It wasn't hard.

233
00:08:11.260 --> 00:08:12.704
MATT: Well, not originally.

234
00:08:12.704 --> 00:08:14.120
(laughter)

235
00:08:14.120 --> 00:08:17.735
MATT: So, so (laughs)!

236
00:08:17.735 --> 00:08:19.200
LIAM: It's really like an optical illusion, right,

237
00:08:19.200 --> 00:08:21.300
when you take a pencil and you go like this.

238
00:08:21.300 --> 00:08:22.870
TALIESIN: It follows you around the room,

239
00:08:22.870 --> 00:08:23.940
no matter where you go.

240
00:08:23.940 --> 00:08:24.773
MATT: All right!

241
00:08:24.773 --> 00:08:26.530
(laughter)

242
00:08:26.530 --> 00:08:27.490
MATT: All right!

243
00:08:27.490 --> 00:08:28.440
TALIESIN: Oh no.

244
00:08:29.860 --> 00:08:31.160
MATT: So.

245
00:08:31.160 --> 00:08:32.220
ASHLEY: Oh boy.

246
00:08:32.220 --> 00:08:34.017
MATT: Let's go ahead and jump into

247
00:08:34.017 --> 00:08:37.791
tonight's episode of Critical Role.

248
00:08:37.791 --> 00:08:40.774
(yelling)

249
00:08:40.774 --> 00:08:43.158
(water bubbling)

250
00:08:43.158 --> 00:08:45.908

251

MATT: Welcome back.

284
00:10:18.121 --> 00:10:23.121
So last we left off: The Mighty Nein, upon watching

285
00:10:24.708 --> 00:10:29.475
and aiding Caleb finally finish his design,

286
00:10:29.475 --> 00:10:33.446
completing what Halas once had attempted to complete,

287
00:10:33.446 --> 00:10:36.991
designing a spell in which you
could transmogrify another person

288
00:10:36.991 --> 00:10:39.863
into a different body of their choosing,

289
00:10:39.863 --> 00:10:43.697
the ritual attempted but failing

290
00:10:43.697 --> 00:10:46.681
at the realization that a curse still remained on Nott

291
00:10:46.681 --> 00:10:51.681
that prevented any sort of shift or change.

292
00:10:51.877 --> 00:10:54.014
Trailing the source back, it seems,

293
00:10:54.014 --> 00:10:56.790
to the individual responsible for cursing her

294
00:10:56.790 --> 00:10:59.960
with the goblin body in the first place, you returned

295
00:10:59.960 --> 00:11:03.920
to Zadash to research this possible individual,

296
00:11:03.920 --> 00:11:07.220
coming to find it might be this Isharnai the Prism Sage,

297
00:11:07.220 --> 00:11:10.190
an individual that lives north of Kamordah,

298
00:11:10.190 --> 00:11:12.520
in the Bromkiln Hills, within the Cyrios Mountains,

299
00:11:12.520 --> 00:11:13.770
near Mount Mentiri.

300
00:11:14.930 --> 00:11:17.100
After this moment, you realized you had

301
00:11:17.100 --> 00:11:20.700
to travel west from Zadash to Kamordah,

302
00:11:20.700 --> 00:11:24.875
and wanting to clarify the possible link

303
00:11:24.875 --> 00:11:27.940
of this sage

304
00:11:27.940 --> 00:11:31.300
that had originally done this terrible deed to Nott

305
00:11:31.300 --> 00:11:33.800
at the request of the goblins that had killed her,

306
00:11:35.890 --> 00:11:40.680
you met the Lionett family. A tense reunion,

307
00:11:41.590 --> 00:11:45.850
long held back, ensued, at which point,

308
00:11:45.850 --> 00:11:50.850
it was confirmed that it seems this same sage

309
00:11:50.910 --> 00:11:53.550
that helped bring her family's fortune

310
00:11:53.550 --> 00:11:58.360
and had put a black cloud over her name and life

311
00:11:58.360 --> 00:12:02.820
since she was born may indeed be the same one

312
00:12:02.820 --> 00:12:04.920
that's responsible for Nott's predicament.

313
00:12:06.010 --> 00:12:09.990
This tense reunion complete, you all stepped outside,

314
00:12:09.990 --> 00:12:14.840
into the evening rain and gave Beau a hug of support

315
00:12:15.800 --> 00:12:20.110
after the emotional, exhausting interaction.

316
00:12:20.110 --> 00:12:22.040
And that's where we left off.

317
00:12:22.040 --> 00:12:27.040
As you all pull away, outside of the Lionett estate,

318
00:12:27.470 --> 00:12:29.110
the darkened sky above,

319
00:12:30.700 --> 00:12:33.540
the cold rain pattering around you in the muddy streets,

320
00:12:33.540 --> 00:12:37.010
the smell of sulfur and minerals still strong in the air,

321
00:12:37.010 --> 00:12:38.150
what would you like to do?

322
00:12:39.750 --> 00:12:41.870
SAM: We just left the Lionett house?

323
00:12:41.870 --> 00:12:42.703
MATT: Correct.

324
00:12:43.970 --> 00:12:46.450
LAURA: Are we finding somewhere to stay here,

325
00:12:46.450 --> 00:12:48.000
or are we heading straight out?

326
00:12:50.650 --> 00:12:52.300 line:15%
MARISHA: What time is it?

327
00:12:52.300 --> 00:12:55.470 line:15%
MATT: At this point, I'd say it's close to eight o'clock.

328
00:12:55.470 --> 00:12:57.210 line:15%
It's not terribly late.

329
00:12:57.210 --> 00:12:59.533 line:15%
LAURA: But it's around dinnertime.
SAM: 8 p.m.

330
00:12:59.533 --> 00:13:00.366 line:15%
LAURA: Yeah.

331
00:13:00.366 --> 00:13:01.670 line:15%
LIAM: It's an estate, right?

332
00:13:01.670 --> 00:13:03.650 line:15%
It's not a town, was it?

333
00:13:03.650 --> 00:13:04.930 line:15%
LAURA: It is a town.
LIAM: It is a town?

334
00:13:04.930 --> 00:13:06.110 line:15%
TALIESIN: It was a town

335
00:13:06.110 --> 00:13:07.935 line:15%
at the bottom of a hill.
LIAM: All right.

336
00:13:07.935 --> 00:13:10.870 line:15%
SAM: But up here, it's just a vineyard,

337
00:13:10.870 --> 00:13:13.137 line:15%
and then a few miles over, another vineyard,

338
00:13:13.137 --> 00:13:14.650 line:15%
or do we have neighbors?

339
00:13:14.650 --> 00:13:18.170 line:15%
MARISHA: There's a tavern not too (coughs) far, sorry.

340
00:13:18.170 --> 00:13:19.080 line:15%
SAM: Choked up from that meeting?

341
00:13:19.080 --> 00:13:23.950 line:15%
MARISHA: A little phlegm still from that. Lot of snot.

342
00:13:23.950 --> 00:13:27.620 line:15%
Yeah, there's a dive bar with a few beds, not far.

343
00:13:29.394 --> 00:13:30.690 line:15%
Right?
LAURA: Let's do that.

344
00:13:30.690 --> 00:13:31.642 line:15%
MATT: Yeah, you can go in there.

345
00:13:31.642 --> 00:13:33.510 line:15%
MARISHA: Okay.
LAURA: (laughs)

346
00:13:33.510 --> 00:13:34.343 line:15%
LAURA: Yeah.

347
00:13:34.343 --> 00:13:35.176 line:15%
MARISHA: Okay.
TRAVIS: Wait, are we going to run

348
00:13:35.176 --> 00:13:36.390 line:15%
into your old crew there?

349
00:13:36.390 --> 00:13:37.390 line:15%
Are we going to see, like, a bunch

350
00:13:37.390 --> 00:13:39.200 line:15%
of old high school dropouts or anything?

351
00:13:39.200 --> 00:13:42.050 line:15%
Are there going to be fights before we go to the real fight?

352
00:13:42.930 --> 00:13:44.960 line:15%
Is your name going to be written on the bathroom wall

353
00:13:44.960 --> 00:13:46.240 line:15%
by six different hands?

354
00:13:47.410 --> 00:13:48.840 line:15%
MARISHA: That, maybe, yeah.

355
00:13:49.760 --> 00:13:51.174 line:15%
Yeah.
TRAVIS: We have to go.

356
00:13:51.174 --> 00:13:52.115 line:15%
MARISHA: Yeah.

357
00:13:52.115 --> 00:13:52.948 line:15%
LAURA: Yes.

358
00:13:53.899 --> 00:13:54.732 line:15%
MARISHA: We'll see.

359
00:13:54.732 --> 00:13:57.290 line:15%
SAM: Beauregard, I stole this from your dad's house.

360
00:13:57.290 --> 00:13:58.123 line:15%
MARISHA: What, what?

361
00:13:58.123 --> 00:14:01.610 line:15%
SAM: It's just a little statue of a rabbit made of jade.

362
00:14:01.610 --> 00:14:02.443 line:15%
MARISHA: Mm-hmm.

363
00:14:02.443 --> 00:14:03.550 line:15%
SAM: Do you want it?

364
00:14:03.550 --> 00:14:04.770 line:15%
MARISHA: No, you keep it.

365
00:14:04.770 --> 00:14:07.600 line:15%
SAM: I just thought, I don't know,

366
00:14:07.600 --> 00:14:09.045 line:15%
fuck that guy, right?

367
00:14:10.382 --> 00:14:12.350 line:15%
MARISHA: (sighs)

368
00:14:12.350 --> 00:14:14.830 line:15%
I'm, yeah, I'm--

369
00:14:17.820 --> 00:14:18.770 line:15%
I'm working it out.

370
00:14:19.900 --> 00:14:21.410 line:15%
LIAM: How 'bout a drink?

371
00:14:21.410 --> 00:14:24.310 line:15%
MARISHA: That sounds fucking fantastic.

372
00:14:25.443 --> 00:14:26.943 line:15%
LAURA: Did you steal anything else?

373
00:14:28.760 --> 00:14:30.957 line:15%
SAM: I mean, just the hearts of America, but--

374
00:14:30.957 --> 00:14:32.500 line:15%
LIAM: What?

375
00:14:32.500 --> 00:14:34.243 line:15%
SAM: Sorry, I blacked out for a second.

376
00:14:34.243 --> 00:14:37.110 line:15%
(laughter)

377
00:14:37.110 --> 00:14:38.840 line:15%
ASHLEY: I haven't been there.

378
00:14:38.840 --> 00:14:40.440 line:15%
But I haven't been a lot of places.

379
00:14:40.440 --> 00:14:41.390 line:15%
TRAVIS: Oh, it's a place.

380
00:14:44.190 --> 00:14:46.160 line:15%
Look, we would totally lead the way,

381
00:14:46.160 --> 00:14:49.970 line:15%
but this is your fucking stomping grounds, so you know.

382
00:14:49.970 --> 00:14:52.140 line:15%
MARISHA: Yeah, follow me.

383
00:14:52.140 --> 00:14:53.440 line:15%
What is the name of that bar?

384
00:14:53.440 --> 00:14:54.882 line:15%
I feel like I read some--

385
00:14:54.882 --> 00:14:56.885 line:15%
MATT: Gemmed Hearth Inn.

386
00:14:56.885 --> 00:14:58.579 line:15%
And it's called an inn loosely.

387
00:14:58.579 --> 00:15:01.580 line:15%
(laughter)

388
00:15:01.580 --> 00:15:04.040 line:15%
MATT: As you recall, it has three rooms

389
00:15:05.427 --> 00:15:09.680 line:15%
that are repurposed storage chambers,

390
00:15:09.680 --> 00:15:12.850 line:15%
and mostly, people that crash there do so

391
00:15:12.850 --> 00:15:14.030 line:15%
because they've had too much to drink

392
00:15:14.030 --> 00:15:16.090 line:15%
and just need a place to crash

393
00:15:16.090 --> 00:15:18.600 line:15%
or are too drunk to ask for a place to crash

394
00:15:18.600 --> 00:15:21.183 line:15%
and they're placed there anyway
and charged the following morning.

395
00:15:22.120 --> 00:15:25.005 line:15%
But it's been a while since you traveled to this space.

396
00:15:25.005 --> 00:15:25.838 line:15%
ALL: ♪ It's been a while ♪

397
00:15:25.838 --> 00:15:27.291 line:15%
MATT: Yeah, I was waiting for it as soon as I said it.

398
00:15:27.291 --> 00:15:29.200 line:15%
(laughter)

399
00:15:29.200 --> 00:15:31.430 line:15%
TALIESIN: Have we finally found
the D&amp;D equivalent of a hostel?

400
00:15:31.430 --> 00:15:32.558 line:15%
Have we finally found a hostel?

401
00:15:32.558 --> 00:15:33.511 line:15%
TRAVIS: (laughs)

402
00:15:33.511 --> 00:15:34.840 line:15%
MATT: Kinda, yeah.
TALIESIN: All right.

403
00:15:34.840 --> 00:15:37.460 line:15%
TRAVIS: Oh shit, are the beds in the open spaces?

404
00:15:37.460 --> 00:15:40.399 line:15%
MARISHA: No, there's walls.

405
00:15:40.399 --> 00:15:41.676 line:15%
There's walls.

406
00:15:41.676 --> 00:15:44.638 line:15%
TALIESIN: (snickers)

407
00:15:44.638 --> 00:15:45.520 line:15%
MARISHA: Yeah, let's go.
TRAVIS: Two walls, apparently,

408
00:15:45.520 --> 00:15:47.330 line:15%
separating three spaces, what a thrill.

409
00:15:47.330 --> 00:15:49.559 line:15%
LIAM: Walls are the defining features.

410
00:15:49.559 --> 00:15:51.490 line:15%
MATT: (laughs) All righty.

411
00:15:52.360 --> 00:15:53.193 line:15%
So gathering your things,

412
00:15:53.193 --> 00:15:54.770 line:15%
you still have your horses with you.

413
00:15:54.770 --> 00:15:56.070 line:15%
They were hitched outside of the estate.

414
00:15:56.070 --> 00:15:58.130 line:15%
So you go ahead and take their leads

415
00:15:58.130 --> 00:16:02.640 line:15%
and walk them through the not quite as busied streets,

416
00:16:02.640 --> 00:16:03.550 line:15%
now that the sun is down.

417
00:16:03.550 --> 00:16:05.440 line:15%
There are lanterns that have been placed out

418
00:16:05.440 --> 00:16:09.220 line:15%
since the sun set, these large poles with hooks on them

419
00:16:09.220 --> 00:16:11.420 line:15%
where, at night, these lanterns are placed for people

420
00:16:11.420 --> 00:16:12.420 line:15%
that are heading back from work

421
00:16:12.420 --> 00:16:14.040 line:15%
and individuals that are trying to find their way

422
00:16:14.040 --> 00:16:17.560 line:15%
through the darkened evening roads,

423
00:16:17.560 --> 00:16:19.080 line:15%
eventually finding your way to the exterior

424
00:16:19.080 --> 00:16:21.500
of the Gemmed Hearth Inn.

425
00:16:21.500 --> 00:16:22.700
You look at it.

426
00:16:22.700 --> 00:16:24.980
From the outside, you wouldn't be able to tell it's an inn.

427
00:16:24.980 --> 00:16:26.680
It looks like a warehouse.

428
00:16:26.680 --> 00:16:27.920
It looks like a storage facility.

429
00:16:27.920 --> 00:16:31.870
It's very simple, bland woods.

430
00:16:31.870 --> 00:16:33.130
The mud across the ground

431
00:16:33.130 --> 00:16:34.580 line:15%
has been spattered and dried

432
00:16:34.580 --> 00:16:35.770 line:15%
and spattered and dried to the point

433
00:16:35.770 --> 00:16:38.650 line:15%
where it's just repeatedly caked across the baseboards

434
00:16:38.650 --> 00:16:40.650 line:15%
of the exterior, about a foot and a half to two feet up,

435
00:16:40.650 --> 00:16:42.430 line:15%
where it looks like it's slowly being pulled

436
00:16:42.430 --> 00:16:44.050 line:15%
into the earth.

437
00:16:44.050 --> 00:16:45.750 line:15%
It might be, who knows?

438
00:16:46.590 --> 00:16:48.530 line:15%
But the door is partially ajar,

439
00:16:48.530 --> 00:16:50.940 line:15%
and as you step up to the interior,

440
00:16:50.940 --> 00:16:54.470 line:15%
the wood creaks beneath your weight with each step,

441
00:16:54.470 --> 00:16:56.820 line:15%
and the warm interior greets you along

442
00:16:56.820 --> 00:17:01.030 line:15%
with the combined smell, it seems, of burned meat,

443
00:17:01.030 --> 00:17:03.913 line:15%
strong, spilled, soured alcohol,

444
00:17:03.913 --> 00:17:06.700 line:15%
possibly a bit of bile, who knows?

445
00:17:06.700 --> 00:17:08.610 line:15%
It's a delightful interior.

446
00:17:08.610 --> 00:17:11.760 line:15%
There's five tables, of which only one

447
00:17:11.760 --> 00:17:13.560 line:15%
of them has a patron, at the moment.

448
00:17:14.600 --> 00:17:19.600 line:15%
You see a very, very, very old, folded face of a man.

449
00:17:19.920 --> 00:17:21.450 line:15%
He is missing all of his teeth,

450
00:17:21.450 --> 00:17:23.350 line:15%
and his jaw scoops forward

451
00:17:23.350 --> 00:17:25.850 line:15%
and overlaps the front, a bit.

452
00:17:25.850 --> 00:17:27.800 line:15%
He's holding a really heavy tankard in front

453
00:17:27.800 --> 00:17:29.560 line:15%
with both hands, and he's just looking into it.

454
00:17:29.560 --> 00:17:31.800 line:15%
It looks like he's in the process of either falling asleep

455
00:17:31.800 --> 00:17:35.700 line:15%
or having the deepest thought you could possibly imagine.

456
00:17:35.700 --> 00:17:38.530 line:15%
Across the table, in the back, you see a well-polished bar.

457
00:17:38.530 --> 00:17:39.700 line:15%
It doesn't match the rest of it, and in fact,

458
00:17:39.700 --> 00:17:42.690 line:15%
you get the sense maybe it had acquired this

459
00:17:42.690 --> 00:17:46.030 line:15%
curved bar recently

460
00:17:46.030 --> 00:17:47.970 line:15%
and just has nothing else to update the interior.

461
00:17:47.970 --> 00:17:50.450 line:15%
It stands out with how well polished it is.

462
00:17:50.450 --> 00:17:52.970 line:15%
Whether he saved up and bought it, or another place closed,

463
00:17:52.970 --> 00:17:55.500 line:15%
and he got it in an auction, who knows?

464
00:17:55.500 --> 00:17:56.333 line:15%
But behind it,

465
00:17:56.333 --> 00:18:01.333 line:15%
you see the rather rotund, heavyset figure

466
00:18:01.900 --> 00:18:05.830 line:15%
of a gruff man with strong stubble

467
00:18:05.830 --> 00:18:08.290 line:15%
across his heavy, square jaw.

468
00:18:09.330 --> 00:18:11.100 line:15%
His hair is receding in the back,

469
00:18:11.100 --> 00:18:13.070 line:15%
a Friar Tuck type bald spot,

470
00:18:13.070 --> 00:18:15.570 line:15%
where he has a bit of a bowl cut around the sides.

471
00:18:16.540 --> 00:18:20.050 line:15%
He has a series of scars across one side of his face,

472
00:18:20.050 --> 00:18:23.810 line:15%
minor scars, and one discolored eye on that side,

473
00:18:23.810 --> 00:18:25.440 line:15%
on his right side.

474
00:18:25.440 --> 00:18:27.220 line:15%
But he glances up for a bit.

475
00:18:27.220 --> 00:18:30.230 line:15%
You see him finish polishing the countertop,

476
00:18:30.230 --> 00:18:31.630 line:15%
more than it needs to be polished.

477
00:18:31.630 --> 00:18:32.730 line:15%
He looks up.

478
00:18:34.130 --> 00:18:35.876 line:15%
"Hello, can I help you?"

479
00:18:35.876 --> 00:18:37.490 line:15%
LIAM: Yeah, hello.

480
00:18:37.490 --> 00:18:39.550 line:15%
It has been a shit of a day,

481
00:18:39.550 --> 00:18:41.080 line:15%
and we could all use a drink.

482
00:18:41.080 --> 00:18:45.590 line:15%
And Caleb places a gold on the countertop.

483
00:18:45.590 --> 00:18:47.390 line:15%
This should cover a round, yeah?

484
00:18:47.390 --> 00:18:49.560 line:15%
MATT: "Yeah, yeah, it'll cover a round, no worries."

485
00:18:49.560 --> 00:18:51.410 line:15%
LIAM: Is it all wine here

486
00:18:51.410 --> 00:18:53.970 line:15%
because of the proximity to the estate,

487
00:18:53.970 --> 00:18:54.803 line:15%
or do you have--?

488
00:18:54.803 --> 00:18:56.790 line:15%
MATT: "Oh, if you want wine, that's
a whole different ballgame."

489
00:18:56.790 --> 00:18:57.730 line:15%
LIAM: Good, I don't.

490
00:18:57.730 --> 00:18:59.004 line:15%
MATT: "Whatever a ballgame is."
LIAM: Whisky, please.

491
00:18:59.004 --> 00:19:00.780 line:15%
(laughter)

492
00:19:00.780 --> 00:19:02.500 line:15%
MATT: Goatball, you know, you've seen it around.

493
00:19:02.500 --> 00:19:03.680 line:15%
It's a big, popular thing

494
00:19:03.680 --> 00:19:04.580 line:15%
with the goliaths.

495
00:19:05.420 --> 00:19:08.230 line:15%
TRAVIS: Goatball! (laughs)

496
00:19:08.230 --> 00:19:09.063 line:15%
TALIESIN: Canon.

497
00:19:09.063 --> 00:19:11.380 line:15%
MATT: Well, it is, from Campaign 1.

498
00:19:11.380 --> 00:19:14.260 line:15%
TRAVIS: Oh my god.
MARISHA: That's right.

499
00:19:14.260 --> 00:19:16.410 line:15%
MATT: "I just assumed you were looking for ale, maybe,

500
00:19:16.410 --> 00:19:19.058 line:15%
"but if you want wine, that's pricey."

501
00:19:19.058 --> 00:19:20.320 line:15%
LAURA: No, no, no.

502
00:19:20.320 --> 00:19:21.220 line:15%
LIAM: Nothing in between?

503
00:19:21.220 --> 00:19:23.890 line:15%
You don't have anything stronger than ale?

504
00:19:23.890 --> 00:19:25.060 line:15%
Perhaps--

505
00:19:25.060 --> 00:19:26.380 line:15%
TRAVIS: Whisky, Scotch?

506
00:19:26.380 --> 00:19:27.229 line:15%
MATT: "Oh, liquor?"

507
00:19:27.229 --> 00:19:28.804 line:15%
TRAVIS: Yeah.

508
00:19:28.804 --> 00:19:31.270 line:15%
MATT: "Yeah. How much you want?

509
00:19:31.270 --> 00:19:33.610 line:15%
"Like just a shot each

510
00:19:33.610 --> 00:19:35.730 line:15%
"or, like, full thing?"
MARISHA: Just give us a bottle.

511
00:19:35.730 --> 00:19:37.240 line:15%
Maybe two.

512
00:19:37.240 --> 00:19:39.440 line:15%
MATT: "You're going to need to put a few more gold on."

513
00:19:39.440 --> 00:19:41.580 line:15%
LIAM: I turn and I add a platinum.

514
00:19:41.580 --> 00:19:42.413 line:15%
SAM: Woo!

515
00:19:43.259 --> 00:19:44.770 line:15%
LAURA: We also want rooms and stuff.

516
00:19:44.770 --> 00:19:45.650 line:15%
LIAM: Keep it coming.

517
00:19:45.650 --> 00:19:47.860 line:15%
MARISHA: Yeah, can we have all the rooms?

518
00:19:47.860 --> 00:19:49.210 line:15%
Do you have any more rooms?

519
00:19:50.618 --> 00:19:53.150 line:15%
MATT: "I got three rooms."
SAM: Maybe ask how many rooms there are first.

520
00:19:53.150 --> 00:19:54.370 line:15%
MATT: "If you don't mind sharing.

521
00:19:54.370 --> 00:19:57.680 line:15%
"I can get you a bottle and get you rooms for the night."

522
00:19:57.680 --> 00:19:59.673 line:15%
MARISHA: We'll take all the rooms. It's three rooms.

523
00:19:59.673 --> 00:20:01.410 line:15%
MATT: He reaches over and scoots the coin across

524
00:20:01.410 --> 00:20:05.000 line:15%
and happily tucks it into a pocket, buttons it shut,

525
00:20:06.300 --> 00:20:08.770 line:15%
heads off to the back and, for a moment, leaves you alone,

526
00:20:08.770 --> 00:20:11.160 line:15%
just your troupe and that one old guy

527
00:20:11.160 --> 00:20:14.460 line:15%
who's been awfully quiet in a darkened chamber.

528
00:20:15.600 --> 00:20:17.450 line:15%
TRAVIS: What's up, Grandad?

529
00:20:17.450 --> 00:20:18.283 line:15%
How are things?

530
00:20:20.270 --> 00:20:21.103 line:15%
MATT: No response.

531
00:20:21.103 --> 00:20:22.220 line:15%
He doesn't acknowledge.

532
00:20:22.220 --> 00:20:26.648 line:15%
TRAVIS: (louder) What's up, Granddad!

533
00:20:26.648 --> 00:20:27.740 line:15%
TALIESIN: I cast Speak with Dead.

534
00:20:27.740 --> 00:20:30.825 line:15%
I'm just kidding.
(laughter)

535
00:20:30.825 --> 00:20:32.919 line:15%
SAM: Maybe he's just sleeping.

536
00:20:32.919 --> 00:20:34.270 line:15%
Maybe he's hard-of-hearing.
ASHLEY: Maybe he wants

537
00:20:34.270 --> 00:20:35.900 line:15%
to be left alone.
TALIESIN: Maybe he's

538
00:20:35.900 --> 00:20:36.733 line:15%
not a grandfather.
LAURA: Maybe he's had

539
00:20:36.733 --> 00:20:38.499 line:15%
a really bad day, too.

540
00:20:38.499 --> 00:20:41.623 line:15%
TRAVIS: (grumbling)

541
00:20:41.623 --> 00:20:42.641 line:15%
I walk over to him.

542
00:20:42.641 --> 00:20:44.030 line:15%
(laughter)

543
00:20:44.030 --> 00:20:47.924 line:15%
I do, like, the slow lean-in, field of vision.

544
00:20:49.526 --> 00:20:51.117 line:15%
MATT: "Hey!"

545
00:20:51.117 --> 00:20:53.276
MARISHA: Oh, that explains it.

546
00:20:53.276 --> 00:20:54.737 line:15%
TRAVIS: (loudly) How are you?
LAURA: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

547
00:20:54.737 --> 00:20:55.989 line:15%
MATT: "No, please don't do anything!"

548
00:20:55.989 --> 00:20:57.610 line:15%
TRAVIS: Okay, no, it's not like that.

549
00:20:59.470 --> 00:21:02.420 line:15%
Enjoy your, enjoy your beverage.

550
00:21:02.420 --> 00:21:03.586 line:15%
MATT: "I am!"

551
00:21:03.586 --> 00:21:04.501 line:15%
(laughter)

552
00:21:04.501 --> 00:21:06.240 line:15%
LAURA: You are really intimidating, Fjord.

553
00:21:06.240 --> 00:21:08.040 line:15%
SAM: He could hear you.

554
00:21:08.040 --> 00:21:10.000 line:15%
TRAVIS: I'm a little confused by that exchange.

555
00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:12.230 line:15%
SAM: He just chose not to listen.

556
00:21:12.230 --> 00:21:14.400 line:15%
LIAM: He read your lips.

557
00:21:14.400 --> 00:21:15.760 line:15%
SAM: Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, maybe he's a lipreader.

558
00:21:15.760 --> 00:21:17.440 line:15%
LIAM: Do you, do you read lips?

559
00:21:18.370 --> 00:21:19.700 line:15%
MATT: "What?"

560
00:21:19.700 --> 00:21:20.533 line:15%
SAM: Okay.

561
00:21:20.533 --> 00:21:21.743 line:15%
LIAM: That's a mystery solved there.

562
00:21:23.230 --> 00:21:24.990 line:15%
ASHLEY: You just went up and scared the poor man.

563
00:21:24.990 --> 00:21:25.823 line:15%
TRAVIS: Yeah.

564
00:21:26.720 --> 00:21:27.890 line:15%
I have that effect, Yasha.

565
00:21:27.890 --> 00:21:29.210 line:15%
I don't know if you know.

566
00:21:29.210 --> 00:21:30.920 line:15%
ASHLEY: Ah, yes, you're very, very scary

567
00:21:30.920 --> 00:21:32.520 line:15%
and intimidating.
TRAVIS: Terrifying.

568
00:21:33.710 --> 00:21:35.590 line:15%
LIAM: (loudly) What is the news here in town?

569
00:21:35.590 --> 00:21:37.250 line:15%
SAM: Oh boy.

570
00:21:37.250 --> 00:21:38.790 line:15%
LIAM: (louder) The news!

571
00:21:38.790 --> 00:21:40.160 line:15%
MATT: "The noose?"

572
00:21:40.160 --> 00:21:40.993 line:15%
LIAM and LAURA: *Ja.**

573
00:21:41.941 --> 00:21:46.000 line:15%
MATT: "Well, there hasn't been
a hanging in about four years!"

574
00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:47.370 line:15%
TALIESIN: Saw that coming.
LAURA: Yeah.

575
00:21:47.370 --> 00:21:49.254 line:15%
I don't think he would have heard it anyway.

576
00:21:49.254 --> 00:21:50.806 line:15%
LIAM: (groans)

577
00:21:50.806 --> 00:21:51.639 line:15%
SAM: The noose.

578
00:21:51.639 --> 00:21:52.472 line:15%
LAURA: The noose.

579
00:21:52.472 --> 00:21:54.582 line:15%
ASHLEY: Do you come here often?
MATT: "Aah!"

580
00:21:54.582 --> 00:21:56.176 line:15%
(laughter)

581
00:21:56.176 --> 00:21:58.376 line:15%
ASHLEY: I'm going to not talk to him, because I think

582
00:21:59.380 --> 00:22:00.646 line:15%
we'll leave it to you guys.
TRAVIS: I think you scared him.

583
00:22:00.646 --> 00:22:04.150 line:15%
Yeah.

584
00:22:04.150 --> 00:22:05.330 line:15%
Ask him his name.

585
00:22:05.330 --> 00:22:06.400 line:15%
ASHLEY: What's your name?

586
00:22:07.240 --> 00:22:08.073 line:15%
MATT: "What?"

587
00:22:08.073 --> 00:22:10.170 line:15%
(laughter)

588
00:22:10.170 --> 00:22:11.040 line:15%
ASHLEY: (louder) Your name?

589
00:22:12.150 --> 00:22:13.537 line:15%
MATT: "Darmin."

590
00:22:13.537 --> 00:22:15.430 line:15%
LAURA and ASHLEY: Darmin!

591
00:22:15.430 --> 00:22:17.690 line:15%
MATT: "What's your name?"

592
00:22:17.690 --> 00:22:19.530 line:15%
ASHLEY: My name is Yasha.

593
00:22:19.530 --> 00:22:21.180 line:15%
MATT: "Okay."

594
00:22:21.180 --> 00:22:22.493 line:15%
He goes back to drinking.

595
00:22:22.493 --> 00:22:23.611 line:15%
TALIESIN: (laughs)

596
00:22:23.611 --> 00:22:24.960 line:15%
TRAVIS: That was great.

597
00:22:24.960 --> 00:22:26.210 line:15%
You really got through to him quickly.

598
00:22:26.210 --> 00:22:28.200 line:15%
ASHLEY: I did, and he gave me his name.

599
00:22:28.200 --> 00:22:31.636 line:15%
Usually people don't offer that until the next morning.

600
00:22:31.636 --> 00:22:34.090 line:15%
(laughter)

601
00:22:34.090 --> 00:22:34.923 line:15%
LAURA: Hey!

602
00:22:36.610 --> 00:22:38.276 line:15%
ASHLEY: Just kidding.
TRAVIS: Yasha be fucking.

603
00:22:38.276 --> 00:22:41.319 line:15%
(laughter)

604
00:22:41.319 --> 00:22:42.875 line:15%
MARISHA: Yasha, she fucks.

605
00:22:42.875 --> 00:22:45.375 line:15%
(laughter)

606
00:22:47.580 --> 00:22:52.580 line:15%
MATT: Eventually, a large glass bottle, dark brown in color,

607
00:22:53.500 --> 00:22:54.540 line:15%
no label--
LIAM: Put it here.

608
00:22:54.540 --> 00:22:56.370 line:15%
MATT: Just hands it over.

609
00:22:56.370 --> 00:22:57.604 line:15%
"All right, there you are.

610
00:22:57.604 --> 00:22:59.960 line:15%
"(sighs) Here's your keys.

611
00:23:01.050 --> 00:23:03.500 line:15%
"Welcome to the, uh, welcome to the Gemmed Hearth.

612
00:23:05.080 --> 00:23:06.350 line:15%
"You look familiar."

613
00:23:06.350 --> 00:23:07.752 line:15%
MARISHA: Nah!

614
00:23:07.752 --> 00:23:08.714 line:15%
(laughter)

615
00:23:08.714 --> 00:23:11.016 line:15%
MATT: "All right," turns right
around and goes back to the bar.

616
00:23:11.016 --> 00:23:12.990 line:15%
(laughter)

617
00:23:12.990 --> 00:23:14.800 line:15%
LIAM: Did he bring a glass with that bottle,

618
00:23:14.800 --> 00:23:15.633 line:15%
or is it just the bottle?

619
00:23:15.633 --> 00:23:17.030 line:15%
MATT: No, just the bottle.
LIAM: Just the bottle?

620
00:23:17.030 --> 00:23:19.050 line:15%
SAM: Well, if that's a friend of yours,

621
00:23:19.050 --> 00:23:21.870 line:15%
you should find out what the scuttlebutt is around here.

622
00:23:21.870 --> 00:23:24.120 line:15%
LAURA: Why?
MARISHA: I don't have friends, dude.

623
00:23:24.120 --> 00:23:26.030 line:15%
SAM: Well, I would assume if anyone was your friend,

624
00:23:26.030 --> 00:23:29.250 line:15%
it was the purveyor of whiskies.

625
00:23:29.250 --> 00:23:31.700 line:15%
MARISHA: Yeah, yeah, I mean, yeah, it's the same old guy

626
00:23:31.700 --> 00:23:33.520 line:15%
who's been here for, like, the past 10 years.

627
00:23:33.520 --> 00:23:36.070 line:15%
TRAVIS: 10 years, right, so he's known you

628
00:23:36.070 --> 00:23:39.669 line:15%
since you were little bitty?

629
00:23:39.669 --> 00:23:43.090 line:15%
MARISHA: Well, ever since I started sneaking in here, yeah.

630
00:23:43.090 --> 00:23:46.295 line:15%
TRAVIS: You snuck in here, underage, to grab a drink?

631
00:23:47.313 --> 00:23:49.880 line:15%
MARISHA: Have you seen this place?

632
00:23:49.880 --> 00:23:51.450 line:15%
What am I supposed to do?

633
00:23:51.450 --> 00:23:52.283 line:15%
TRAVIS: Yeah, it's true.

634
00:23:52.283 --> 00:23:53.250 line:15%
It's true.
LAURA: Draw.

635
00:23:53.250 --> 00:23:55.030 line:15%
You could draw

636
00:23:55.030 --> 00:23:57.200 line:15%
or play piano.
TRAVIS: Did you ever steal

637
00:23:57.200 --> 00:23:58.570 line:15%
or get arrested here?

638
00:23:59.590 --> 00:24:02.240 line:15%
Have you been kicked out of this establishment before?

639
00:24:02.240 --> 00:24:05.090 line:15%
MARISHA: Actually, it was back behind this place,

640
00:24:05.090 --> 00:24:08.420 line:15%
where I was doing the deal that I got busted,

641
00:24:08.420 --> 00:24:09.510 line:15%
when I was doing the handoff

642
00:24:09.510 --> 00:24:11.260 line:15%
of my family's wine.
TRAVIS: Oh shit.

643
00:24:11.260 --> 00:24:12.520 line:15%
We are on hallowed ground.

644
00:24:12.520 --> 00:24:13.353 line:15%
MARISHA: Yeah.

645
00:24:13.353 --> 00:24:14.186 line:15%
TALIESIN: Is there any art on the wall,

646
00:24:14.186 --> 00:24:16.260 line:15%
anything interesting, photo, pictures, I mean,

647
00:24:16.260 --> 00:24:19.260 line:15%
not photographs, obviously, but, like, any carvings, any--

648
00:24:19.260 --> 00:24:20.340 line:15%
MATT: No carvings.

649
00:24:20.340 --> 00:24:23.450 line:15%
The walls are surprisingly bare, except for one piece

650
00:24:23.450 --> 00:24:28.240 line:15%
of, like, a knitted tapestry

651
00:24:28.240 --> 00:24:30.550 line:15%
that's slightly off-center,

652
00:24:30.550 --> 00:24:33.300 line:15%
probably someone's first attempt at knitting.

653
00:24:33.300 --> 00:24:36.780 line:15%
The lines are imperfect.

654
00:24:36.780 --> 00:24:38.880 line:15%
You look at it, and you find your head tilting to the side

655
00:24:38.880 --> 00:24:41.850 line:15%
to try and make a balance to it, and it's just, no,

656
00:24:41.850 --> 00:24:42.683 line:15%
it's just poorly made.

657
00:24:42.683 --> 00:24:44.950 line:15%
TALIESIN: If I unfocus my eyes, do I get a 3-D picture?

658
00:24:44.950 --> 00:24:46.760 line:15%
(laughter)

659
00:24:46.760 --> 00:24:48.610 line:15%
ASHLEY: Dolphins!
MATT: You get a 3-D something.

660
00:24:48.610 --> 00:24:50.010 line:15%
It hurts you to try and contemplate

661
00:24:50.010 --> 00:24:51.520 line:15%
and make sense of the shape.

662
00:24:51.520 --> 00:24:53.810 line:15%
TRAVIS: Jester, I want to consult the history stacks

663
00:24:53.810 --> 00:24:54.740 line:15%
of this place.

664
00:24:54.740 --> 00:24:56.690 line:15%
You take the ladies' room, I'll take the men's room.

665
00:24:56.690 --> 00:24:57.750 line:15%
LAURA: You got it.
TRAVIS: All right.

666
00:24:57.750 --> 00:24:58.700 line:15%
We go and we look in

667
00:24:58.700 --> 00:25:00.800 line:15%
the restroom for anything--
TALIESIN: There's one bathroom.

668
00:25:00.800 --> 00:25:05.170 line:15%
MATT: There is a singular restroom that is just a hole

669
00:25:05.170 --> 00:25:08.100 line:15%
in a plank of wood in an attached outhouse.

670
00:25:08.100 --> 00:25:09.010 line:15%
TRAVIS: This is unexpected.

671
00:25:09.010 --> 00:25:10.220 line:15%
LIAM: Is Beauregard's name still

672
00:25:10.220 --> 00:25:11.320 line:15%
in there?
LAURA: This is much smaller

673
00:25:11.320 --> 00:25:13.830 line:15%
than I expected it to be.
TRAVIS: The smell is incredible.

674
00:25:13.830 --> 00:25:15.850 line:15%
LAURA: Also, yes, it's very stinky.

675
00:25:15.850 --> 00:25:16.880 line:15%
TRAVIS: Is there writing on the wall?

676
00:25:16.880 --> 00:25:18.400 line:15%
MATT: Make a perception check.

677
00:25:18.400 --> 00:25:20.480 line:15%
SAM: Are you guys in there, together, alone?

678
00:25:20.480 --> 00:25:22.713 line:15%
LAURA: Are you trying to get me alone, Fjord?

679
00:25:22.713 --> 00:25:24.812
because if you are, this is probably

680
00:25:24.812 --> 00:25:26.730
not the best place to do it.

681
00:25:26.730 --> 00:25:28.110 line:15%
TRAVIS: (fart sound)

682
00:25:28.110 --> 00:25:28.943 line:15%
11.

683
00:25:28.943 --> 00:25:31.349 line:15%
(laughter)

684
00:25:33.740 --> 00:25:36.030 line:15%
MATT: You don't see any major carvings.

685
00:25:36.030 --> 00:25:38.330 line:15%
There are some gashes in the wood,

686
00:25:38.330 --> 00:25:40.922 line:15%
like a fight probably went down in here, at some point.

687
00:25:40.922 --> 00:25:43.120 line:15%
TRAVIS: (laughs)
LAURA: Oh!

688
00:25:44.290 --> 00:25:45.510 line:15%
MATT: And that's about all you can find.

689
00:25:45.510 --> 00:25:46.440 line:15%
TRAVIS: Okay.
MATT: Yeah.

690
00:25:46.440 --> 00:25:48.370 line:15%
There's no, like, "come here

691
00:25:48.370 --> 00:25:51.940 line:15%
"for a good time"-type messages left, unfortunately.

692
00:25:51.940 --> 00:25:54.000 line:15%
TRAVIS: We could shut the door.

693
00:25:54.000 --> 00:25:54.833 line:15%
LAURA: You could what?

694
00:25:54.833 --> 00:25:56.010 line:15%
TRAVIS: We should shut the door.

695
00:25:56.010 --> 00:25:57.678 line:15%
LAURA: Shut the door?!
TRAVIS: Yeah.

696
00:25:57.678 --> 00:25:59.368 line:15%
LAURA: Oh, like, get out and shut the door?

697
00:25:59.368 --> 00:26:02.524 line:15%
TRAVIS: Well, you said-- (laughs).

698
00:26:02.524 --> 00:26:03.467 line:15%
Yes!

699
00:26:03.467 --> 00:26:07.532 line:15%
LAURA: Okay, do it.

700
00:26:10.267 --> 00:26:11.574 line:15%
TRAVIS: All right.

701
00:26:11.574 --> 00:26:13.731 line:15%
LAURA: (gags)

702
00:26:13.731 --> 00:26:15.980 line:15%
SAM: Hey, guys, back so soon?

703
00:26:17.140 --> 00:26:19.770 line:15%
How was it, being alone together

704
00:26:19.770 --> 00:26:21.270 line:15%
in whatever room you were in?

705
00:26:21.270 --> 00:26:22.370 line:15%
TRAVIS: We were in the privy.

706
00:26:22.370 --> 00:26:23.880 line:15%
LAURA: It was stinky.

707
00:26:23.880 --> 00:26:25.450 line:15%
SAM: Oh.
TRAVIS: Single occupant.

708
00:26:25.450 --> 00:26:27.383 line:15%
LAURA: And really dark.

709
00:26:27.383 --> 00:26:29.820 line:15%
SAM: (gasps) Ooh!
LAURA: I know.

710
00:26:29.820 --> 00:26:33.540 line:15%
SAM: I'll let my imagination run wild.

711
00:26:33.540 --> 00:26:36.510 line:15%
LIAM: You're going to christen that bottle or what?

712
00:26:36.510 --> 00:26:38.820 line:15%
MARISHA: Oh yeah, here, cheers.

713
00:26:38.820 --> 00:26:40.240 line:15%
LIAM: There's no glasses.

714
00:26:40.240 --> 00:26:41.620 line:15%
MARISHA: Oh!
LIAM: Just the bottle.

715
00:26:41.620 --> 00:26:43.970 line:15%
TRAVIS: Yeah, pass it around.

716
00:26:43.970 --> 00:26:44.960 line:15%
MARISHA: Pass it around.

717
00:26:46.620 --> 00:26:48.510 line:15%
LIAM: Rough day, Beauregard Lionett?

718
00:26:48.510 --> 00:26:49.700 line:15%
MARISHA: Yeah.

719
00:26:49.700 --> 00:26:50.620 line:15%
LIAM: *Ja**.
MARISHA: A day.

720
00:26:52.420 --> 00:26:53.253 line:15%
LIAM: Gulp.

721
00:26:54.490 --> 00:26:56.410 line:15%
MATT: It is strong and it gets the job done.

722
00:26:56.410 --> 00:26:59.340 line:15%
You get the sense that liquor's not their specialty here.

723
00:26:59.340 --> 00:27:02.291 line:15%
This particular abode doesn't have a wide selection.

724
00:27:02.291 --> 00:27:03.783 line:15%
LIAM: Ah.

725
00:27:03.783 --> 00:27:04.790 line:15%
MARISHA: (laughs)

726
00:27:04.790 --> 00:27:06.460 line:15%
MARISHA: Wait, what was that?
TRAVIS: Why are you drinking?

727
00:27:06.460 --> 00:27:07.293 line:15%
SAM: Just wiped off the top.

728
00:27:07.293 --> 00:27:10.500 line:15%
LAURA: I'm going to pour some in a little potion bottle.

729
00:27:10.500 --> 00:27:11.333 line:15%
MATT: Okay.

730
00:27:11.333 --> 00:27:12.790 line:15%
TRAVIS: Are you going to feed that to Sprinkle later?

731
00:27:12.790 --> 00:27:15.090 line:15%
LAURA: No, I think it'll make a good paint thinner.

732
00:27:16.581 --> 00:27:17.547 line:15%
TALIESIN: That's a clever idea.

733
00:27:17.547 --> 00:27:18.620 line:15%
ASHLEY: Yeah, that's a bit rough.

734
00:27:19.539 --> 00:27:21.400 line:15%
MARISHA: (clears throat)

735
00:27:21.400 --> 00:27:24.182 line:15%
TRAVIS: Woof, yeah.

736
00:27:24.182 --> 00:27:26.300 line:15%
LAURA: (laughs)

737
00:27:26.300 --> 00:27:28.760 line:15%
MARISHA: I actually used to remove nail polish

738
00:27:28.760 --> 00:27:30.480 line:15%
with the liquor that I got here.

739
00:27:30.480 --> 00:27:31.313 line:15%
LAURA: See?
TRAVIS: Makes sense.

740
00:27:31.313 --> 00:27:32.445 line:15%
LAURA: That's what I'm talking about.

741
00:27:32.445 --> 00:27:33.670 line:15%
MARISHA: It was great.

742
00:27:33.670 --> 00:27:34.850 line:15%
It's very multipurpose.
TRAVIS: I can feel

743
00:27:34.850 --> 00:27:35.810 line:15%
the temperature rising.
LAURA: I'm going to go peek

744
00:27:35.810 --> 00:27:38.020 line:15%
behind that tapestry on the wall.

745
00:27:38.020 --> 00:27:38.853 line:15%
MATT: Okay.

746
00:27:38.853 --> 00:27:41.245 line:15%
SAM: Secret tunnels?
LAURA: Anything?

747
00:27:41.245 --> 00:27:43.610 line:15%
MATT: There's a portion of the wall

748
00:27:43.610 --> 00:27:47.580 line:15%
that appears darker in color.

749
00:27:47.580 --> 00:27:49.040 line:15%
SAM: (gasps)
LAURA: Hmm?

750
00:27:49.040 --> 00:27:50.430 line:15%
TRAVIS: Black mold.

751
00:27:50.430 --> 00:27:52.755 line:15%
MATT: You get the sense that sometimes moisture

752
00:27:52.755 --> 00:27:54.505 line:15%
has been held in this tapestry--
SAM: (laughs)

753
00:27:54.505 --> 00:27:56.290 line:15%
TRAVIS: (groans)
MATT: -- that has affected the wall behind it,

754
00:27:56.290 --> 00:27:58.510 line:15%
and the dust from the interior

755
00:27:58.510 --> 00:28:00.210 line:15%
of the room has lightened the wood around it.

756
00:28:00.210 --> 00:28:04.485 line:15%
But beyond that, there's no apparent hidden doorway.

757
00:28:04.485 --> 00:28:06.365 line:15%
It's just old shitty tapestry.
LAURA: I'm going to carve a dick.

758
00:28:06.365 --> 00:28:08.020 line:15%
MATT: Hmm, you're going to carve a dick?

759
00:28:08.020 --> 00:28:09.930 line:15%
There's only one person to stop you,

760
00:28:09.930 --> 00:28:12.590 line:15%
and he is old and looking at his cup still.

761
00:28:12.590 --> 00:28:16.062 line:15%
LIAM: I'm sure Matt has got--
TALIESIN: Has the barkeep not come back yet?

762
00:28:16.062 --> 00:28:17.770 line:15%
MATT: Oh no, he's just sitting down.
LIAM: -- so much planned,

763
00:28:17.770 --> 00:28:19.570 line:15%
and we're like, "I'm going to sniff the shitter"

764
00:28:19.570 --> 00:28:21.000 line:15%
and "I'm going to yell at an old man."

765
00:28:21.000 --> 00:28:22.030 line:15%
(laughter)

766
00:28:22.030 --> 00:28:22.863 line:15%
MATT: D&amp;D!

767
00:28:24.000 --> 00:28:24.833 line:15%
TRAVIS: You're right.

768
00:28:24.833 --> 00:28:26.182 line:15%
We've got a long trip ahead of us.

769
00:28:26.182 --> 00:28:27.440 line:15%
We should rest.

770
00:28:27.440 --> 00:28:29.710 line:15%
TALIESIN: I'm going to go up to the bar.

771
00:28:29.710 --> 00:28:30.543 line:15%
Hey, friend, I'm sorry.

772
00:28:30.543 --> 00:28:31.830 line:15%
What was your name again?

773
00:28:31.830 --> 00:28:32.807 line:15%
MATT: "Oh, uh--"

774
00:28:33.990 --> 00:28:36.275 line:15%
LIAM: (whispering) You shut your green mouth.

775
00:28:36.275 --> 00:28:37.208 line:15%
TALIESIN: I don't know if we actually asked.

776
00:28:37.208 --> 00:28:38.090 line:15%
MATT: I don't think you guys actually asked

777
00:28:38.090 --> 00:28:39.890 line:15%
that yet, hold on there.

778
00:28:39.890 --> 00:28:41.397 line:15%
TRAVIS: It's not easy being green.

779
00:28:41.397 --> 00:28:44.160 line:15%
MARISHA: (laughs)

780
00:28:44.160 --> 00:28:44.993 line:15%
MATT: "Kerry."

781
00:28:44.993 --> 00:28:46.090 line:15%
TALIESIN: Kerry?
MATT: "Yeah."

782
00:28:46.090 --> 00:28:47.050 line:15%
TALIESIN: Can I get something?

783
00:28:47.050 --> 00:28:49.700 line:15%
Do you have anything, like, just some juice

784
00:28:49.700 --> 00:28:53.620 line:15%
or something without alcohol in it?

785
00:28:53.620 --> 00:28:54.453 line:15%
MATT: "Let me look."

786
00:28:54.453 --> 00:28:56.700 line:15%
TALIESIN: All right.
LAURA: Get some for me, Caduceus!

787
00:28:56.700 --> 00:28:58.500 line:15%
TALIESIN: Get two of whatever you find.

788
00:28:58.500 --> 00:29:01.090 line:15%
MATT: "Okay, I'll be right back."

789
00:29:01.090 --> 00:29:02.860 line:15%
He goes and leaves for a second,

790
00:29:02.860 --> 00:29:05.360 line:15%
and he comes back a moment later with a glass.

791
00:29:06.810 --> 00:29:09.130 line:15%
It looks like a large mason jar

792
00:29:09.130 --> 00:29:11.310 line:15%
with a little bottleneck at the top,

793
00:29:11.310 --> 00:29:14.980 line:15%
filled with a milk-like substance.

794
00:29:14.980 --> 00:29:16.290 line:15%
SAM: "Milk-like substance"?

795
00:29:16.290 --> 00:29:17.640 line:15%
MATT: "I got some goat milk."

796
00:29:17.640 --> 00:29:19.206 line:15%
LAURA: Oh, yum.
MATT: "If that works for ya?"

797
00:29:19.206 --> 00:29:20.139 line:15%
TALIESIN: That'll do it.

798
00:29:20.139 --> 00:29:22.170 line:15%
MATT: "Okay." Goes ahead and pours it out for ya.

799
00:29:22.170 --> 00:29:23.650 line:15%
TALIESIN: How long have you been here for,

800
00:29:23.650 --> 00:29:24.960 line:15%
working in this town?
LAURA: How long has this milk

801
00:29:24.960 --> 00:29:26.210 line:15%
been here for?

802
00:29:26.210 --> 00:29:28.053 line:15%
TALIESIN: Hey, that's funny.

803
00:29:28.053 --> 00:29:28.886 line:15%
MATT: "Where, in Kamordah?"

804
00:29:28.886 --> 00:29:29.940 line:15%
"I grew up here."

805
00:29:29.940 --> 00:29:30.840 line:15%
TALIESIN: Really?
MATT: "Yeah.

806
00:29:31.930 --> 00:29:32.790 line:15%
"You're not from around here.

807
00:29:32.790 --> 00:29:34.300 line:15%
"I can recognize that already."

808
00:29:34.300 --> 00:29:36.000 line:15%
TALIESIN: No, first time, we, we--

809
00:29:37.800 --> 00:29:38.633 line:15%
LAURA: *Oui, oui**.

810
00:29:38.633 --> 00:29:39.466 line:15%
TALIESIN: We were looking to--

811
00:29:39.466 --> 00:29:42.120 line:15%
(laughter)

812
00:29:42.120 --> 00:29:43.610 line:15%
TALIESIN: Just doing a little digging around.

813
00:29:43.610 --> 00:29:46.700 line:15%
What do you know about the Lionett family, out of curiosity?

814
00:29:46.700 --> 00:29:49.010 line:15%
MATT: "Oh they're-- (chuckles)

815
00:29:49.010 --> 00:29:51.970 line:15%
"They're one of them rich types, living up here,

816
00:29:51.970 --> 00:29:54.120 line:15%
"on the mountainside, the cliffside, there.

817
00:29:56.050 --> 00:29:57.820 line:15%
"Bunch of stuck-up pricks, if you ask me,

818
00:29:57.820 --> 00:30:00.550 line:15%
"but, you know, that's par for the course

819
00:30:00.550 --> 00:30:02.460 line:15%
"for any of the folks living in that area."

820
00:30:02.460 --> 00:30:06.860 line:15%
TALIESIN: Well, just had my first meeting with them,

821
00:30:06.860 --> 00:30:08.840 line:15%
and yeah, it was a bit rough.
MATT: "Looking for work, are ya?"

822
00:30:08.840 --> 00:30:10.580 line:15%
TALIESIN: I was looking for a little work, sure.

823
00:30:10.580 --> 00:30:12.840 line:15%
MATT: All right, what skillsets ya got?

824
00:30:12.840 --> 00:30:16.430 line:15%
TALIESIN: Well, we do a lot of things, to be honest.

825
00:30:16.430 --> 00:30:18.020 line:15%
We're kind of on a job, right now,

826
00:30:18.020 --> 00:30:19.810 line:15%
but in general--
MATT: "You good with a shovel?"

827
00:30:19.810 --> 00:30:21.610 line:15%
TALIESIN: Actually, yes, I am.

828
00:30:21.610 --> 00:30:24.210 line:15%
MATT: "All right, I got a brother
who owns a livery out there.

829
00:30:24.210 --> 00:30:25.650 line:15%
"He needs someone to shovel the horseshit,

830
00:30:25.650 --> 00:30:27.110 line:15%
"and it's been hard to fill the space.

831
00:30:27.110 --> 00:30:28.225 line:15%
"He's got a lot of horses."

832
00:30:28.225 --> 00:30:30.690 line:15%
TALIESIN: Huh, I mean, there's a lot you can do with that.

833
00:30:30.690 --> 00:30:34.050 line:15%
Has he ever thought about the resale value of clean manure,

834
00:30:34.050 --> 00:30:36.870 line:15%
especially if you're trying to grow crops?

835
00:30:36.870 --> 00:30:40.470 line:15%
Not to throw that off to the side, but anyway--

836
00:30:40.470 --> 00:30:42.550 line:15%
MATT: "Growing crops here can be a problem if you're not one

837
00:30:42.550 --> 00:30:46.470 line:15%
"of the particular enclosed farming arrangements,

838
00:30:46.470 --> 00:30:48.830 line:15%
"in Kamordah, and they already have their endpoint,

839
00:30:48.830 --> 00:30:53.460 line:15%
"but we've asked, but they seem to be pretty taken care of

840
00:30:53.460 --> 00:30:55.010 line:15%
"in that department."

841
00:30:55.010 --> 00:30:57.320 line:15%
TALIESIN: Ah, that's a shame.

842
00:30:57.320 --> 00:30:59.570 line:15%
LAURA: Why is everything in this bar about poop?

843
00:31:01.480 --> 00:31:03.430 line:15%
MARISHA: Everything in Kamordah is about poop.

844
00:31:05.773 --> 00:31:07.430 line:15%
TALIESIN: Yeah, sadly, I don't think it worked out,

845
00:31:07.430 --> 00:31:09.210 line:15%
but we'll be moving on pretty soon.

846
00:31:09.210 --> 00:31:11.440 line:15%
I was just sort of curious, after we had a bit

847
00:31:11.440 --> 00:31:13.480 line:15%
of a weird conversation with him.

848
00:31:14.870 --> 00:31:15.703 line:15%
MATT: "Yeah, I mean,

849
00:31:17.620 --> 00:31:18.720 line:15%
"they're not going to hire anyone,

850
00:31:18.720 --> 00:31:21.510 line:15%
"then their loss, really.

851
00:31:21.510 --> 00:31:24.800 line:15%
"Bunch of right uptight pricks. Hmmph."

852
00:31:24.800 --> 00:31:26.500 line:15%
TALIESIN: Bit superstitious, too, I think.

853
00:31:29.780 --> 00:31:31.307 line:15%
That's my goat's milk, come on.

854
00:31:31.307 --> 00:31:32.420 line:15%
(laughter)

855
00:31:32.420 --> 00:31:33.620 line:15%
MARISHA: Oh.

856
00:31:33.620 --> 00:31:34.900 line:15%
Oh, this is, oh.

857
00:31:34.900 --> 00:31:36.820 line:15%
TALIESIN: That's just going to
curdle with what you're drinking.

858
00:31:36.820 --> 00:31:38.180 line:15%
ASHLEY: It's very weird with the whisky.

859
00:31:38.180 --> 00:31:40.700 line:15%
I wouldn't suggest putting the two together.

860
00:31:40.700 --> 00:31:42.740 line:15%
MARISHA: Why did they put them in the same jug?

861
00:31:42.740 --> 00:31:45.313 line:15%
TALIESIN: You're going to have cheese dream because of that.

862
00:31:45.313 --> 00:31:46.197 line:15%
ASHLEY: What's a cheese dream?

863
00:31:46.197 --> 00:31:48.542 line:15%
TALIESIN: It's the dreams you have when you have cheese.

864
00:31:48.542 --> 00:31:49.375 line:15%
Didn't anybody know about this?

865
00:31:49.375 --> 00:31:50.380 line:15%
ASHLEY: I don't know if I want to know.

866
00:31:50.380 --> 00:31:51.302 line:15%
LAURA: We should go to sleep.

867
00:31:51.302 --> 00:31:52.730 line:15%
(laughter)

868
00:31:52.730 --> 00:31:54.638 line:15%
LIAM: This is almost as good as penis puppets.

869
00:31:54.638 --> 00:31:56.380 line:15%
(laughter)

870
00:31:56.380 --> 00:31:57.970 line:15%
TRAVIS: Cheese dreams!

871
00:31:57.970 --> 00:31:59.010 line:15%
ASHLEY: I've heard of these.

872
00:31:59.010 --> 00:32:00.500 line:15%
TALIESIN: It's true.

873
00:32:00.500 --> 00:32:02.132 line:15%
MATT: You already learned the dangers of whisky milk, so.

874
00:32:02.132 --> 00:32:04.190 line:15%
LAURA: Yeah.
TRAVIS: Yeah.

875
00:32:04.190 --> 00:32:06.310 line:15%
SAM: Are you okay, Beauregard?

876
00:32:06.310 --> 00:32:07.542 line:15%
MARISHA: Yeah, yeah.

877
00:32:08.910 --> 00:32:10.250 line:15%
SAM: Okay.

878
00:32:10.250 --> 00:32:15.250 line:15%
MARISHA: Surprisingly, better than I thought, actually.

879
00:32:18.140 --> 00:32:20.390 line:15%
SAM: Will you share a room, tonight?

880
00:32:22.090 --> 00:32:23.080 line:15%
MARISHA: Oh yeah, we're going to have to.

881
00:32:23.080 --> 00:32:24.740 line:15%
These are, like, four by eights.

882
00:32:24.740 --> 00:32:26.060 line:15%
They're horrible.

883
00:32:26.060 --> 00:32:26.893 line:15%
Yeah.

884
00:32:26.893 --> 00:32:28.470 line:15%
LAURA: There's three rooms, right?

885
00:32:28.470 --> 00:32:32.888 line:15%
Yeah, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm!

886
00:32:32.888 --> 00:32:33.823 line:15%
Hmm?

887
00:32:33.823 --> 00:32:35.068 line:15%
ASHLEY: Mm-hmm.

888
00:32:35.068 --> 00:32:35.901 line:15%
TRAVIS: Sure.
LAURA: All right.

889
00:32:35.901 --> 00:32:36.750 line:15%
TALIESIN: I just keep coming up with seven.

890
00:32:36.750 --> 00:32:38.450 line:15%
I don't know how that helps.

891
00:32:38.450 --> 00:32:39.900 line:15%
LAURA: All right, we're going to go to sleep then.

892
00:32:39.900 --> 00:32:40.733 line:15%
SAM: Good night.

893
00:32:40.733 --> 00:32:43.330 line:15%
MATT: Okay, you head to your respective chambers.

894
00:32:44.340 --> 00:32:46.624 line:15%
They are disappointing.

895
00:32:46.624 --> 00:32:48.476 line:15%
(laughter)

896
00:32:48.476 --> 00:32:50.520 line:15%
TRAVIS: Disappointed!

897
00:32:50.520 --> 00:32:54.570 line:15%
MATT: Each contains two cots that would roughly assemble,

898
00:32:54.570 --> 00:32:57.950 line:15%
if put next to each other, to a standard inn bed.

899
00:32:57.950 --> 00:32:59.030 line:15%
LAURA: Whoa.

900
00:32:59.030 --> 00:33:02.110 line:15%
MATT: The cushions that are placed upon them,

901
00:33:02.110 --> 00:33:04.950 line:15%
upon sitting down, are stuffed with possibly cotton,

902
00:33:04.950 --> 00:33:07.070 line:15%
possibly elements of hay.

903
00:33:07.070 --> 00:33:09.290 line:15%
Depending on how you prepare it, there are lumpy

904
00:33:09.290 --> 00:33:10.820 line:15%
and hard bits in the inside.

905
00:33:12.620 --> 00:33:14.620 line:15%
It's a little bit of a rough space here.

906
00:33:15.780 --> 00:33:20.650 line:15%
No windows, so very enclosed, but functional,

907
00:33:20.650 --> 00:33:23.650 line:15%
and the locks do work, which I think is the important thing.

908
00:33:25.330 --> 00:33:27.220 line:15%
LIAM: After finally putting the thread all the way

909
00:33:27.220 --> 00:33:29.320 line:15%
around the room, Caleb just grabs some of the hay

910
00:33:29.320 --> 00:33:31.220 line:15%
and throws it on the ground and lies down

911
00:33:31.220 --> 00:33:32.870 line:15%
to bed down on the floor, saying:

912
00:33:34.230 --> 00:33:35.730 line:15%
Just like the old days.

913
00:33:35.730 --> 00:33:37.210 line:15%
SAM: Yeah, I'll do the same.

914
00:33:37.210 --> 00:33:38.043 line:15%
MATT: Okay.

915
00:33:39.098 --> 00:33:41.670 line:15%
MARISHA: I'm not going to lie, kind of miss this.

916
00:33:41.670 --> 00:33:43.130 line:15%
It's nice being back in this.

917
00:33:43.130 --> 00:33:46.690 line:15%
Had some good times in these shit-boxes. (laughs)

918
00:33:46.690 --> 00:33:48.131 line:15%
LAURA: Wow.
MARISHA: Yeah.

919
00:33:48.131 --> 00:33:49.488 line:15%
TRAVIS: Oh.

920
00:33:49.488 --> 00:33:50.866 line:15%
LAURA: (groans)

921
00:33:50.866 --> 00:33:51.716 line:15%
I'm going to...

922
00:33:54.170 --> 00:33:55.003 line:15%
What do you--

923
00:33:55.003 --> 00:33:56.300 line:15%
ASHLEY: I can sleep on the floor.

924
00:33:57.500 --> 00:33:59.167 line:15%
I'm used to it anyway.

925
00:33:59.167 --> 00:34:01.250 line:15%
MARISHA: Honestly it's probably safer than the mattresses.

926
00:34:01.250 --> 00:34:02.174 line:15%
ASHLEY: Yeah.
LAURA: Really?

927
00:34:02.174 --> 00:34:03.090 line:15%
MARISHA: Yeah.
LAURA: Oh.

928
00:34:03.090 --> 00:34:04.600 line:15%
ASHLEY: I feel like, for me, it's weird sleeping

929
00:34:04.600 --> 00:34:07.080 line:15%
on something that, you know--

930
00:34:07.080 --> 00:34:08.540 line:15%
LAURA: Yeah, yeah, that makes sense.

931
00:34:08.540 --> 00:34:10.520 line:15%
ASHLEY: I'm too tall for that bed.

932
00:34:10.520 --> 00:34:11.940 line:15%
MARISHA: I'm immune to poison and disease,

933
00:34:11.940 --> 00:34:14.059 line:15%
so I'll take the mattresses (laughs).

934
00:34:14.059 --> 00:34:15.972 line:15%
(laughter)

935
00:34:15.972 --> 00:34:17.547 line:15%
MATT: Good call.

936
00:34:17.547 --> 00:34:19.029 line:15%
TALIESIN: Caduceus is sleeping on the floor.

937
00:34:19.029 --> 00:34:20.030 line:15%
TRAVIS: That's why you're so promiscuous.

938
00:34:20.030 --> 00:34:22.460 line:15%
LAURA: I lean up against the wall in the corner

939
00:34:22.460 --> 00:34:24.424 line:15%
and try to fall asleep, sitting up.

940
00:34:24.424 --> 00:34:26.190 line:15%
MATT: Okay.

941
00:34:27.470 --> 00:34:29.370 line:15%
LIAM: Best reason to be a monk.

942
00:34:30.510 --> 00:34:32.670 line:15%
TRAVIS: Get that ass.

943
00:34:34.557 --> 00:34:37.090 line:15%
MATT: All of you find sleep, though at different intervals,

944
00:34:37.090 --> 00:34:39.680 line:15%
due to levels of comfort, in the rooms

945
00:34:39.680 --> 00:34:42.010 line:15%
that you've rented for the night.

946
00:34:42.010 --> 00:34:44.420 line:15%
But nevertheless, sleep does come.

947
00:34:44.420 --> 00:34:47.000 line:15%
You take your long rest, and in the morning,

948
00:34:47.000 --> 00:34:51.050 line:15%
begin to awaken, as the heat, the trapped heat

949
00:34:51.050 --> 00:34:52.340 line:15%
from the interior of these rooms, begins

950
00:34:52.340 --> 00:34:55.018 line:15%
to get a little musky.

951
00:34:55.018 --> 00:34:56.020 line:15%
TALIESIN: There's no windows.

952
00:34:56.020 --> 00:34:58.100 line:15%
I bet it's so rank in these rooms.

953
00:34:58.100 --> 00:34:58.933 line:15%
LAURA: Ew, people probably

954
00:34:58.933 --> 00:35:01.130 line:15%
peed in the corner, too.
TALIESIN: It's like a giant gym sock.

955
00:35:01.130 --> 00:35:01.963 line:15%
MATT: Yeah.
LAURA: When they're drunk.

956
00:35:01.963 --> 00:35:03.200 line:15%
MATT: It's not great.

957
00:35:03.200 --> 00:35:04.033 line:15%
LAURA: Gross.

958
00:35:04.033 --> 00:35:05.500 line:15%
MATT: You get the sense they're somewhat cleaned

959
00:35:05.500 --> 00:35:07.270 line:15%
between people who stay there,

960
00:35:07.270 --> 00:35:09.000 line:15%
but being there for a night,

961
00:35:09.000 --> 00:35:13.340 line:15%
you can immediately pick up the gentle history.

962
00:35:13.340 --> 00:35:14.304 line:15%
LAURA: Ew!

963
00:35:14.304 --> 00:35:15.604 line:15%
(laughter)

964
00:35:15.604 --> 00:35:16.533 line:15%
SAM: Gross.
LAURA: Nasty.

965
00:35:16.533 --> 00:35:18.710 line:15%
LIAM: When Caleb arises, he cantrips a little bit of flame

966
00:35:18.710 --> 00:35:20.475 line:15%
in his hand and just sort of burns away the--

967
00:35:20.475 --> 00:35:21.308 line:15%
(laughter)

968
00:35:21.308 --> 00:35:22.940 line:15%
MATT: Perfect.
LIAM: -- the scent.

969
00:35:22.940 --> 00:35:25.110 line:15%
MARISHA: Caduceus, does he have any shage?

970
00:35:25.110 --> 00:35:25.943 line:15%
Shage?

971
00:35:25.943 --> 00:35:27.850 line:15%
LIAM: (like Sean Connery) You got any shage, Caduceus?

972
00:35:27.850 --> 00:35:29.960 line:15%
MATT: Going to cleanse the room of spirits!

973
00:35:29.960 --> 00:35:32.040 line:15%
(laughter)

MARISHA: Shage for the shnea shnake.

(laughter)

976
00:35:36.948 --> 00:35:38.260 line:15%
TALIESIN: I got stuff that smells nice in here

977
00:35:38.260 --> 00:35:40.180 line:15%
that you can burn, yeah.

978
00:35:40.180 --> 00:35:41.430 line:15%
LAURA: Why don't we just get out?

979
00:35:41.430 --> 00:35:43.700 line:15%
Why don't we just walk right out of the stinky room?

980
00:35:43.700 --> 00:35:45.470 line:15%
LAURA: Let's go.
TRAVIS: Pronto.

981
00:35:46.330 --> 00:35:47.163 line:15%
MATT: All right.

982
00:35:47.163 --> 00:35:51.200 line:15%
SAM: Are we going to the lady's place?

983
00:35:51.200 --> 00:35:53.650 line:15%
LAURA: Yeah, yeah.
SAM: The witch's house

984
00:35:53.650 --> 00:35:54.970 line:15%
or whatever she is?
LAURA: Mm-hmm.

985
00:35:54.970 --> 00:35:55.830 line:15%
TRAVIS: Old Masqier.

986
00:35:55.830 --> 00:35:57.480 line:15%
LAURA: We're going to go fuck up a witch.

987
00:35:57.480 --> 00:35:59.930 line:15%
MARISHA: Yeah, my dad said pretty much
directly north of here,

988
00:35:59.930 --> 00:36:03.755 line:15%
and then when we start seeing the bramble, thorny patches,

989
00:36:03.755 --> 00:36:04.650 line:15%
that we're getting close.

990
00:36:04.650 --> 00:36:07.380 line:15%
TALIESIN: Very much have a conversation, at the very least.

991
00:36:07.380 --> 00:36:08.410 line:15%
LAURA: No, we need to kill her.

992
00:36:08.410 --> 00:36:09.820 line:15%
TRAVIS: Isharnai.

993
00:36:09.820 --> 00:36:11.550 line:15%
TALIESIN: We could do that, too.

994
00:36:11.550 --> 00:36:14.060 line:15%
That might not help, but we could do that, too.

995
00:36:14.060 --> 00:36:14.893 line:15%
LAURA: Oh.

996
00:36:15.830 --> 00:36:18.040 line:15%
We have to, like, hold her down
and make her break the curse,

997
00:36:18.040 --> 00:36:19.090 line:15%
or can we just kill her

998
00:36:19.090 --> 00:36:20.840 line:15%
and make it break the curse?
SAM: Maybe as we walk--

999
00:36:20.840 --> 00:36:23.390 line:15%
or ride? Ride, we're riding as far as we can--

1000
00:36:23.390 --> 00:36:24.580 line:15%
maybe we should come up with a plan.

1001
00:36:24.580 --> 00:36:26.140 line:15%
Like, are we trying to kill her,

1002
00:36:26.140 --> 00:36:29.460 line:15%
or is the thing to try to convince her

1003
00:36:29.460 --> 00:36:32.290 line:15%
to remove the curse, first?

1004
00:36:32.290 --> 00:36:34.460 line:15%
TRAVIS: I think diplomacy is always smart,

1005
00:36:34.460 --> 00:36:36.090 line:15%
but I also think our setting

1006
00:36:36.090 --> 00:36:38.530 line:15%
will determine our strategy, right?

1007
00:36:40.312 --> 00:36:42.230 line:15%
LIAM: Yes, we are running into unknown territory.

1008
00:36:42.230 --> 00:36:44.290 line:15%
We don't know the lay of the land around her home,

1009
00:36:44.290 --> 00:36:47.190 line:15%
so she knows we're coming.

1010
00:36:47.190 --> 00:36:48.023 line:15%
LAURA: That's true.

1011
00:36:48.023 --> 00:36:50.580 line:15%
TRAVIS: I mean, didn't your father say he made a deal?

1012
00:36:50.580 --> 00:36:53.420 line:15%
MARISHA: Mm-hmm, she more or less takes appointments.

1013
00:36:53.420 --> 00:36:54.790 line:15%
She'll bargain with people.

1014
00:36:54.790 --> 00:36:56.456 line:15%
TRAVIS: Talking is certainly an option.
LAURA: Oh, that's true.

1015
00:36:56.456 --> 00:36:58.800 line:15%
Maybe we can bargain with her to make her drop the curse.

1016
00:36:58.800 --> 00:37:01.100 line:15%
SAM: Okay, what do we have to offer?

1017
00:37:01.100 --> 00:37:02.750 line:15%
LAURA: Oh, like so many things.

1018
00:37:02.750 --> 00:37:03.660 line:15%
SAM: Money?

1019
00:37:03.660 --> 00:37:05.370 line:15%
LAURA: Maybe she wants a performance?

1020
00:37:05.370 --> 00:37:07.830 line:15%
She hasn't got entertainment for a long time, I bet,

1021
00:37:07.830 --> 00:37:11.620 line:15%
so like a little performance from The Orphan Makers.

1022
00:37:11.620 --> 00:37:14.228 line:15%
ASHLEY: Yeah, I have a feeling she...

1023
00:37:16.078 --> 00:37:17.494
doesn't want money.

1024
00:37:17.494 --> 00:37:18.870
You know?

1025
00:37:18.870 --> 00:37:20.494 line:15%
MARISHA: Yasha's right.

1026
00:37:20.494 --> 00:37:21.810 line:15%
TALIESIN: You live up in the woods like that,

1027
00:37:21.810 --> 00:37:24.240 line:15%
you got everything you want like that.

1028
00:37:24.240 --> 00:37:25.073 line:15%
TRAVIS: What do you mean?

1029
00:37:25.073 --> 00:37:26.500 line:15%
If not money, what?

1030
00:37:26.500 --> 00:37:30.480 line:15%
MARISHA: My father always claimed that he gambled a part

1031
00:37:30.480 --> 00:37:31.540 line:15%
of his fortune away.

1032
00:37:32.990 --> 00:37:33.850 line:15%
TRAVIS: Money?

1033
00:37:33.850 --> 00:37:34.790 line:15%
MARISHA: No, like--

1034
00:37:35.850 --> 00:37:37.930 line:15%
LAURA: Like luck?
MARISHA: His soul, yeah.

1035
00:37:39.590 --> 00:37:42.440 line:15%
LAURA: Oh (gasps), maybe that's why he's slightly soulless!

1036
00:37:43.340 --> 00:37:44.470 line:15%
MARISHA: Maybe.

1037
00:37:44.470 --> 00:37:47.120 line:15%
LAURA: Maybe he was normal and cool and stuff, before that,

1038
00:37:47.120 --> 00:37:48.340 line:15%
and then he became a dick.

1039
00:37:48.340 --> 00:37:50.990 line:15%
MARISHA: I always wondered what my dad was like before that.

1040
00:37:50.990 --> 00:37:53.320 line:15%
SAM: Or maybe she hasn't collected yet.

1041
00:37:55.040 --> 00:37:55.873 line:15%
LAURA: Or that.

1042
00:37:57.523 --> 00:37:58.580 line:15%
MARISHA: I don't know.

1043
00:37:58.580 --> 00:38:00.060 line:15%
SAM: Well, we'll find out.

1044
00:38:00.060 --> 00:38:01.840 line:15%
LAURA: Are we talking about all the stuff on the horses?

1045
00:38:01.840 --> 00:38:02.700 line:15%
SAM: Yeah, we're moving.

1046
00:38:02.700 --> 00:38:05.820 line:15%
TRAVIS: We are moving at a quickened pace.

1047
00:38:05.820 --> 00:38:07.220 line:15%
MARISHA: For the longest time,

1048
00:38:07.220 --> 00:38:11.300 line:15%
I thought it was just your everyday,

1049
00:38:11.300 --> 00:38:13.940 line:15%
run-of-the-mill scam artist,

1050
00:38:15.300 --> 00:38:18.110 line:15%
another fortune-teller just trying to manipulate someone

1051
00:38:18.110 --> 00:38:22.900 line:15%
into giving them a glimpse into their future.

1052
00:38:22.900 --> 00:38:25.560 line:15%
LIAM: They are far more common than the genuine article.

1053
00:38:27.610 --> 00:38:28.443 line:15%
Hmm.

1054
00:38:28.443 --> 00:38:29.990
MARISHA: Plus, I mean, like,

1055
00:38:29.990 --> 00:38:32.160 line:15%
everything my dad did was so interpretive.

1056
00:38:35.250 --> 00:38:36.390 line:15%
It's ridiculous.

1057
00:38:37.420 --> 00:38:40.220 line:15%
SAM: Maybe I shouldn't be the one who talks to this person,

1058
00:38:41.500 --> 00:38:45.880 line:15%
because I don't know that I could just bargain with her.

1059
00:38:47.128 --> 00:38:49.224 line:15%
I mean, she's awful.

1060
00:38:49.224 --> 00:38:51.577 line:15%
I might just want to, you know. (clicks)

1061
00:38:51.577 --> 00:38:53.260
(imitates crossbow firing)

1062
00:38:53.260 --> 00:38:55.610 line:15%
TRAVIS: Yeah, but, I mean, if this is the same woman

1063
00:38:55.610 --> 00:38:57.630 line:15%
that made you like that,

1064
00:38:58.770 --> 00:39:01.880 line:15%
we at least need to see if she recognizes you.

1065
00:39:01.880 --> 00:39:02.713 line:15%
LAURA: Why?

1066
00:39:03.730 --> 00:39:05.040 line:15%
TRAVIS: Well, I don't know, if we just kill her,

1067
00:39:05.040 --> 00:39:06.810 line:15%
then we're obviously limiting our options,

1068
00:39:06.810 --> 00:39:07.643 line:15%
almost right away.

1069
00:39:07.643 --> 00:39:11.190 line:15%
LIAM: We could shackle her with these.

1070
00:39:11.190 --> 00:39:13.090 line:15%
They're the mystical shackles

1071
00:39:13.090 --> 00:39:14.740 line:15%
that we've had for a long time.

1072
00:39:14.740 --> 00:39:16.006 line:15%
This is a large cucumber.
MARISHA: It's been a while.

TRAVIS: Oh my god.

1081
00:39:33.220 --> 00:39:34.120 line:15%
LIAM: Yeah, we could go in.

1082
00:39:34.120 --> 00:39:35.860 line:15%
She knows that we are coming.

1083
00:39:35.860 --> 00:39:38.120 line:15%
We could try to weaken her a bit,

1084
00:39:38.120 --> 00:39:41.090 line:15%
and once she looks like she has been bled some,

1085
00:39:41.090 --> 00:39:42.330 line:15%
if that can happen,

1086
00:39:43.280 --> 00:39:46.470 line:15%

1089
00:39:51.080 --> 00:39:54.120 line:15%

MARISHA: Man, we're all just nailing it.

1090

TRAVIS: We have a carbon monoxide
detector in the studio, right?

MATT: Good news is if it goes real bad,

1094
00:40:03.840 --> 00:40:05.100 line:15%
we have a lot of people who can call

1095
00:40:05.100 --> 00:40:06.272 line:15%
and send the paramedics.

1096
00:40:06.272 --> 00:40:07.470 line:15%

1115
00:40:40.720 --> 00:40:43.598 line:15%
the most nightmare fuel I've seen in a while.

1121
00:40:52.038 --> 00:40:55.463
As you guys continue leaving Kamordah

1122
00:40:55.463 --> 00:40:59.450 line:15%

that head up the cliff side, at the base

1128
00:41:14.031 --> 00:41:16.390 line:15%
you continue (hooves clopping) going

00:41:16.390 --> 00:41:21.080 line:15%
up the somewhat slick and sometimes steep walkways

1130
00:41:21.080 --> 00:41:24.430 line:15%
until eventually you crest past the first ridge.

1131
00:41:24.430 --> 00:41:26.720 line:15%
As you hit the top and look toward the next element,

1132
00:41:26.720 --> 00:41:27.920 line:15%
it continues down into one

1133
00:41:27.920 --> 00:41:30.170 line:15%
of the many valleys that lie ahead.

1134
00:41:30.170 --> 00:41:34.920 line:15%
You can see miles and miles of deep forest

1135
00:41:34.920 --> 00:41:36.610 line:15%
that coats the mountainsides

1136
00:41:36.610 --> 00:41:39.580 line:15%
and completely fills the interior bowl

1137
00:41:39.580 --> 00:41:42.570 line:15%
and valley before you.

1138
00:41:42.570 --> 00:41:45.930 line:15%
You can see more mountains rising up all around you

1139
00:41:45.930 --> 00:41:49.650 line:15%
as the Cyrios Mountain range just continues to climb.

1140
00:41:49.650 --> 00:41:52.310 line:15%
You can see a little bit to the northwest

1141
00:41:52.310 --> 00:41:55.510 line:15%
of where you are one mountain that rises above the rest

1142
00:41:55.510 --> 00:41:57.160 line:15%
with a deep red-orange color

1143
00:41:57.160 --> 00:41:59.770 line:15%
that you know to be Mount Mentiri,

1144
00:41:59.770 --> 00:42:04.560 line:15%
that is largely believed to be the mountain where the source

1145
00:42:04.560 --> 00:42:08.625 line:15%
of a lot of the geothermal activity comes from.

1146
00:42:11.000 --> 00:42:13.020 line:15%
As you all continue the path downward,

1147
00:42:13.020 --> 00:42:15.110 line:15%
who is leading this?

1148
00:42:15.110 --> 00:42:16.150 line:15%
Who's at the front of the pack?

1149
00:42:16.150 --> 00:42:19.030 line:15%
Who is the one who is watching the paths

1150
00:42:19.030 --> 00:42:21.760 line:15%
and guiding you, hopefully,

1151
00:42:21.760 --> 00:42:23.640 line:15%
in finding the way to your quarry?

1152
00:42:23.640 --> 00:42:26.040 line:15%
TRAVIS: We're not burning that s6th-level spell, are we?

1153
00:42:26.040 --> 00:42:30.070 line:15%
LAURA: Well, how long of a travel is it to get there?

1154
00:42:30.070 --> 00:42:33.540 line:15%
MARISHA: About a day or two?

1155
00:42:34.710 --> 00:42:35.543 line:15%
A day?

1156
00:42:35.543 --> 00:42:36.500 line:15%
MATT: Depending on your means of locomotion.

1157
00:42:36.500 --> 00:42:39.470 line:15%
Your father went by foot, and it took him,

1158
00:42:39.470 --> 00:42:42.770 line:15%
I'm guessing, about a day and a half, two days.

1159
00:42:42.770 --> 00:42:45.280 line:15%
LAURA: Um, horses?

1160
00:42:45.280 --> 00:42:46.113 line:15%
LIAM: Horses.

1161
00:42:46.113 --> 00:42:46.960 line:15%
TRAVIS: As far as we can go on, anyway.

1162
00:42:46.960 --> 00:42:51.740 line:15%
LAURA: I can try it, and then I just won't have a big spell.

1163
00:42:51.740 --> 00:42:53.130 line:15%
MARISHA: Let's wait for a minute, I think.

1164
00:42:53.130 --> 00:42:55.180 line:15%
LAURA: Okay. I can-- you know what I can do,

1165
00:42:55.180 --> 00:42:58.300 line:15%
if we want to take 10 minutes?

1166
00:42:58.300 --> 00:42:59.133 line:15%
SAM: What?

1167
00:42:59.133 --> 00:43:02.250 line:15%
LAURA: I can try to ask the Traveler if he can point us

1168
00:43:02.250 --> 00:43:03.647 line:15%
in the right direction.

1169
00:43:03.647 --> 00:43:06.447 line:15%
SAM: Well, isn't he busy getting ready for TC?

1170
00:43:07.880 --> 00:43:09.060 line:15%
T-Con?

1171
00:43:09.060 --> 00:43:10.000 line:15%
LAURA: Yeah, but I can try.

1172
00:43:10.000 --> 00:43:11.466 line:15%
SAM: TravCo?

1173
00:43:12.480 --> 00:43:13.313 line:15%
Okay, yeah.

1174
00:43:13.313 --> 00:43:15.370 line:15%
LIAM: You have such an intimate relationship with him.

1175
00:43:15.370 --> 00:43:17.730 line:15%
LAURA: Well, maybe he's seen this witch.

1176
00:43:17.730 --> 00:43:19.470 line:15%
MARISHA: Maybe.
LAURA: I haven't asked him.

1177
00:43:19.470 --> 00:43:20.303 line:15%
Have I?

1178
00:43:21.269 --> 00:43:22.360 line:15%
MATT: I don't believe you have.

1179
00:43:22.360 --> 00:43:24.390 line:15%
LAURA: I haven't asked him.

1180
00:43:24.390 --> 00:43:25.406 line:15%
SAM: Go ahead.

1181
00:43:26.530 --> 00:43:27.466 line:15%
LAURA: All right.

1182
00:43:27.466 --> 00:43:28.715 line:15%
LIAM: Whoa!

1183
00:43:28.715 --> 00:43:29.548 line:15%
MATT: (laughs)

1184
00:43:29.548 --> 00:43:30.925 line:15%
(hooves clopping)
(laughter)

1185
00:43:30.925 --> 00:43:33.020 line:15%
LAURA: I hop down off of the horse.

1186
00:43:33.020 --> 00:43:33.853 line:15%
MATT: Okay.

1187
00:43:33.853 --> 00:43:37.762 line:15%
LAURA: I set up all my statues that I've made of him.

1188
00:43:37.762 --> 00:43:39.050 line:15%
MATT: Build a little makeshift altar,

1189
00:43:39.050 --> 00:43:40.788 line:15%
right there on the side of the pathway.

1190
00:43:40.788 --> 00:43:42.240 line:15%
There's a little alcove on the side of the rock

1191
00:43:42.240 --> 00:43:43.570 line:15%
where you can easily set them up,

1192
00:43:43.570 --> 00:43:45.870 line:15%
and it looks like it was intentional

1193
00:43:45.870 --> 00:43:47.290 line:15%
and probably has been there for a while.

1194
00:43:47.290 --> 00:43:48.650 line:15%
LAURA: This is nice.

1195
00:43:48.650 --> 00:43:49.564 line:15%
All right, cool, cool, cool.

1196
00:43:49.564 --> 00:43:52.290 line:15%
I'm going to try to Commune.

1197
00:43:52.290 --> 00:43:55.440 line:15%
MATT: All right, you're casting Commune, got it, okay.

1198
00:43:55.440 --> 00:43:56.490 line:15%
LAURA: I get three questions?

1199
00:43:56.490 --> 00:43:58.090 line:15%
TALIESIN: Mm-hmm.
MATT: You do.

1200
00:43:58.090 --> 00:43:58.923 line:15%
TALIESIN: Yeah.

1201
00:43:58.923 --> 00:44:00.920 line:15%
MATT: As you finish arranging them in the circle,

1202
00:44:00.920 --> 00:44:04.850 line:15%
you sit down, finish part of the spell set-up is you,

1203
00:44:04.850 --> 00:44:09.320 line:15%
even arranging them in a way that is both ascending

1204
00:44:09.320 --> 00:44:11.640 line:15%
in size and geometrically placed

1205
00:44:11.640 --> 00:44:13.430 line:15%
that is pleasing to the eye.

1206
00:44:13.430 --> 00:44:15.690 line:15%
But as you finish the final bits of your incantation,

1207
00:44:15.690 --> 00:44:18.880 line:15%
you feel your smile grow, and you close your eyes

1208
00:44:18.880 --> 00:44:21.260 line:15%
and think very, very hard, in the way

1209
00:44:21.260 --> 00:44:24.760 line:15%
that you do prayer loudly, and all of you guys hear

1210
00:44:24.760 --> 00:44:26.250 line:15%
what she thinks might be her inside voice,

1211
00:44:26.250 --> 00:44:29.210 line:15%
but she speaks loudly around you.

1212
00:44:29.210 --> 00:44:33.613 line:15%
LAURA: Traveler, okay, so, um, we're here,

1213
00:44:33.613 --> 00:44:37.360 line:15%
and I need to talk to you, and I miss you.

1214
00:44:37.360 --> 00:44:38.830 line:15%
Can you come, that was it.

1215
00:44:38.830 --> 00:44:41.530 line:15%
Will it be a question if I ask if you could come talk to me?

1216
00:44:41.530 --> 00:44:42.800 line:15%
Just come talk to me, please.

1217
00:44:42.800 --> 00:44:45.070 line:15%
Okay, that's not a question.

1218
00:44:45.070 --> 00:44:46.467 line:15%
We're communing now.

1219
00:44:46.467 --> 00:44:48.967 line:15%
(laughter)

1220
00:44:50.250 --> 00:44:55.180 line:15%
MATT: As the rain continues to fall around you, the vicinity

1221
00:44:55.180 --> 00:44:59.438 line:15%
that you're sitting has been

1222
00:44:59.438 --> 00:45:01.720
getting slightly drier,

1223
00:45:01.720 --> 00:45:03.190 line:15%
or at least the vicinity

1224
00:45:03.190 --> 00:45:07.350 line:15%
around this little ritual you've set up seems

1225
00:45:07.350 --> 00:45:11.350 line:15%
to have no longer fallen under the rainfall,

1226
00:45:11.350 --> 00:45:12.580 line:15%
and there's a moment.

1227
00:45:12.580 --> 00:45:14.634 line:15%
It's a momentary reprieve from it.

1228
00:45:14.634 --> 00:45:16.100 line:15%
As you open your eyes and look up,

1229
00:45:16.100 --> 00:45:18.870 line:15%
you can see a green cloak blocking the rain

1230
00:45:18.870 --> 00:45:19.970 line:15%
from touching you.

1231
00:45:19.970 --> 00:45:22.697 line:15%
You see the dark hood shaded over you.

1232
00:45:25.692 --> 00:45:26.893 line:15%
Are you all watching her do this ritual?

1233
00:45:26.893 --> 00:45:28.409
TRAVIS and ASHLEY: Yeah.
TALIESIN, MARISHA, and LIAM: Mm-hmm.

1234
00:45:28.409 --> 00:45:30.850 line:15%
MATT: You see emerge from the stone--

1235
00:45:31.920 --> 00:45:32.753 line:15%
SAM: What?

1236
00:45:32.753 --> 00:45:35.930 line:15%
MATT: -- a figure in a green cloak step from outside

1237
00:45:35.930 --> 00:45:39.927 line:15%
of the mountain and protect her from the rain.

1238
00:45:42.990 --> 00:45:44.240 line:15%
Looking down towards you,

1239
00:45:44.240 --> 00:45:46.950 line:15%
you can see just a faint bit of the chin

1240
00:45:46.950 --> 00:45:49.300 line:15%
from what bit of light is coming through,

1241
00:45:50.600 --> 00:45:52.660 line:15%
from bouncing off the ground.

1242
00:45:52.660 --> 00:45:54.160 line:15%
And you see a smile.

1243
00:45:55.330 --> 00:45:59.044 line:15%
"It seems you called me, my dear."

1244
00:45:59.044 --> 00:46:01.830 line:15%
LAURA: Yeah, I hope that's okay.

1245
00:46:01.830 --> 00:46:05.000 line:15%
I tried to talk to you before, and you didn't come,

1246
00:46:05.000 --> 00:46:07.910 line:15%
so I thought maybe what would be better is

1247
00:46:07.910 --> 00:46:11.513 line:15%
if I actually really set it up.

1248
00:46:11.513 --> 00:46:14.480 line:15%
MATT: "Well, I've been very busy
setting up for our coming event."

1249
00:46:14.480 --> 00:46:16.030 line:15%
LAURA: I know, I'm so excited about it.

1250
00:46:16.030 --> 00:46:17.930 line:15%
MATT: "I'm going to need your help here, soon enough."

1251
00:46:17.930 --> 00:46:19.260 line:15%
LAURA: I bought so much fabric.

1252
00:46:19.260 --> 00:46:22.940 line:15%
We can make cloaks and outfits for everybody.

1253
00:46:22.940 --> 00:46:23.773 line:15%
MATT: "Wonderful."

1254
00:46:23.773 --> 00:46:25.534 line:15%
LAURA: Right?
TRAVIS: Divine Sense.

1255
00:46:25.534 --> 00:46:26.367 line:15%
MARISHA: (gasps)
MATT: Okay.

1256
00:46:26.367 --> 00:46:27.810 line:15%
LAURA: What?
SAM: Divine Sense?

1257
00:46:27.810 --> 00:46:29.560 line:15%
Ooh!
MATT: Okay, Divine Sense.

1258
00:46:29.560 --> 00:46:30.487 line:15%
LIAM: Oh shit.

1259
00:46:30.487 --> 00:46:33.370 line:15%
TRAVIS: On the giant green cloak
that just came out of the rock!

1260
00:46:33.370 --> 00:46:34.695 line:15%
SAM: Oh!

1261
00:46:34.695 --> 00:46:35.528 line:15%
ASHLEY: Oh shit.
TRAVIS: (reading) "As an action,

1262
00:46:35.528 --> 00:46:37.783 line:15%
"you can detect good and evil
until the end of your next turn.

1263
00:46:37.783 --> 00:46:39.420 line:15%
"You can sense anything affected by the Hallow spell

1264
00:46:39.420 --> 00:46:41.420 line:15%
"or know the location of each celestial, fiend, undead

1265
00:46:41.420 --> 00:46:44.210 line:15%
"within 60 feet that is not behind total cover."

1266
00:46:44.210 --> 00:46:45.250 line:15%
MATT: Okay.
MARISHA: I've seen this, right?

1267
00:46:45.250 --> 00:46:47.670 line:15%
Beau saw him when we were in Asarius.

1268
00:46:47.670 --> 00:46:50.969 line:15%
MATT: You do not sense anything.

1269
00:46:50.969 --> 00:46:52.080 line:15%
SAM: Do not sense anything?
MATT: Do not sense anything.

1270
00:46:52.080 --> 00:46:54.980 line:15%
TRAVIS: So not a celestial, fiend, undead.

1271
00:46:54.980 --> 00:46:56.500 line:15%
LAURA: That's good.

1272
00:46:56.500 --> 00:46:57.710 line:15%
SAM: Not good *or** evil?
TRAVIS: "Or affected

1273
00:46:57.710 --> 00:46:58.543 line:15%
"by the Hallow spell."

1274
00:46:58.543 --> 00:47:00.292 line:15%
It's just Divine Sense.

1275
00:47:00.292 --> 00:47:01.880 line:15%
MATT: Let me check the Hallow spell, real fast,

1276
00:47:01.880 --> 00:47:04.093 line:15%
just double-check.

1277
00:47:04.093 --> 00:47:05.440 line:15%
I don't remember the specifics of it,

1278
00:47:05.440 --> 00:47:06.480 line:15%
so I want to make sure.
SAM: Wait, you can sense

1279
00:47:06.480 --> 00:47:07.990 line:15%
good or evil?
TRAVIS: No, it's just--

1280
00:47:07.990 --> 00:47:09.520 line:15%
TALIESIN: Specific types of things.

1281
00:47:09.520 --> 00:47:10.670 line:15%
TRAVIS: You detect good and evil.

1282
00:47:10.670 --> 00:47:12.340 line:15%
LIAM: The closest maybe would be a celestial,

1283
00:47:12.340 --> 00:47:14.630 line:15%
but really, if he is a deity, this is Liam talking,

1284
00:47:14.630 --> 00:47:16.060 line:15%
he's something other than--

1285
00:47:16.060 --> 00:47:18.030 line:15%
MATT: Wait, it says anything that--

1286
00:47:18.030 --> 00:47:20.650 line:15%
TRAVIS: It says, "You can sense anything affected

1287
00:47:20.650 --> 00:47:22.500 line:15%
"by the Hallow spell."

1288
00:47:23.368 --> 00:47:24.201 line:15%
I don't know what that is.

1289
00:47:24.201 --> 00:47:26.340 line:15%
MATT: Okay, you do sense something.

1290
00:47:26.340 --> 00:47:27.190 line:15%
SAM: What does that mean?

1291
00:47:27.190 --> 00:47:28.023 line:15%
What does that even mean?

1292
00:47:28.023 --> 00:47:29.180 line:15%
LAURA: What does it mean?
AM: What's a Hallow spell?

1293
00:47:29.180 --> 00:47:30.033 line:15%
MARISHA: What was that, what was that?

1294
00:47:30.033 --> 00:47:32.590 line:15%
LAURA: Huh, what was that?

1295
00:47:32.590 --> 00:47:33.423 line:15%
ASHLEY: What?

1296
00:47:34.830 --> 00:47:35.810 line:15%
SAM: What's a Hallow spell?

1297
00:47:35.810 --> 00:47:39.940 line:15%
MATT: You sense a presence that clicks

1298
00:47:39.940 --> 00:47:41.498 line:15%
into your attention.

1299
00:47:43.610 --> 00:47:45.210 line:15%
"What's your question?"

1300
00:47:45.210 --> 00:47:49.040 line:15%
LAURA: Okay, so we're on our way up north

1301
00:47:49.040 --> 00:47:50.920 line:15%
to go see this, like, witch lady

1302
00:47:50.920 --> 00:47:52.770 line:15%
who's, like, super, super creepy,

1303
00:47:52.770 --> 00:47:54.780 line:15%
and she put a curse on Nott.

1304
00:47:54.780 --> 00:47:56.860 line:15%
MATT: "That's terrible."
LAURA: I know!

1305
00:47:56.860 --> 00:47:59.210 line:15%
She also fucked with Beau's dad.

1306
00:47:59.210 --> 00:48:02.850 line:15%
So basically we want to know

1307
00:48:02.850 --> 00:48:06.990 line:15%
if you know the best way

1308
00:48:06.990 --> 00:48:10.980 line:15%
to, like, get rid of that curse.

1309
00:48:10.980 --> 00:48:12.610 line:15%
Should we talk to her?

1310
00:48:12.610 --> 00:48:14.195 line:15%
Should we attack her?

1311
00:48:15.990 --> 00:48:18.360 line:15%
MATT: "As is the nature of such mysteries,

1312
00:48:18.360 --> 00:48:20.917 line:15%
"I need you to ask me the right kind of question."

1313
00:48:20.917 --> 00:48:23.120 line:15%
LAURA: (groans)

1314
00:48:23.120 --> 00:48:24.903 line:15%
This is getting so specific.

1315
00:48:26.340 --> 00:48:27.640 line:15%
MATT: "Well?"

1316
00:48:28.850 --> 00:48:30.290 line:15%
LAURA: Okay.

1317
00:48:30.290 --> 00:48:32.570 line:15%
MATT: "I'm bound by incantations."

1318
00:48:32.570 --> 00:48:33.623 line:15%
LAURA: Oh, really?

1319
00:48:33.623 --> 00:48:34.456 line:15%
MATT: "Yeah."

1320
00:48:34.456 --> 00:48:35.970 line:15%
LAURA: Oh, this is not the way I should talk to you then,

1321
00:48:35.970 --> 00:48:38.145 line:15%
because I don't like you being bound.

1322
00:48:39.257 --> 00:48:42.210 line:15%
MATT: "(sighs)

1323
00:48:42.210 --> 00:48:46.300 line:15%
"Just ask me a proper question, please."

1324
00:48:46.300 --> 00:48:48.120 line:15%
LAURA: What should I ask him? How should I ask this?

1325
00:48:48.120 --> 00:48:49.000 line:15%
TALIESIN: I'm not there.

1326
00:48:49.000 --> 00:48:51.630 line:15%
SAM: Do we hear him speaking, or is it just her?

1327
00:48:52.780 --> 00:48:54.540 line:15%
MATT: You guys don't hear any conversation,

1328
00:48:54.540 --> 00:48:56.000 line:15%
just her side of it.

1329
00:48:56.000 --> 00:48:57.540 line:15%
SAM: Okay.

1330
00:48:57.540 --> 00:48:59.090 line:15%
LAURA: Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay.

1331
00:49:00.620 --> 00:49:04.475 line:15%
To break the curse, do we need to kill her?

1332
00:49:07.070 --> 00:49:08.937 line:15%
SAM: Which curse? She has several curses.

1333
00:49:08.937 --> 00:49:10.310 line:15%
LAURA: He knows what curse I'm talking about.

1334
00:49:10.310 --> 00:49:12.880 line:15%
SAM: *I** don't know what curse you're talking about.

1335
00:49:12.880 --> 00:49:14.030 line:15%
LAURA: The you curse!

1336
00:49:14.030 --> 00:49:15.070 line:15%
MATT: "That is a method."

1337
00:49:16.550 --> 00:49:17.600 line:15%
LAURA: Okay.

1338
00:49:20.280 --> 00:49:23.480 line:15%
MATT: "Best I can ascertain, but I haven't met the woman."

1339
00:49:23.480 --> 00:49:25.160 line:15%
LAURA: Okay, I'm glad you told me that,

1340
00:49:25.160 --> 00:49:26.790 line:15%
because that was going to be one of my questions.

1341
00:49:26.790 --> 00:49:29.140 line:15%
MATT: "But such curses, there can be many ways."

1342
00:49:29.140 --> 00:49:30.500 line:15%
LAURA: Really?

1343
00:49:30.500 --> 00:49:32.202 line:15%
MATT: "Depends on the curse."
LAURA: Don't answer that.

1344
00:49:32.202 --> 00:49:36.391 line:15%
(laughter)

1345
00:49:36.391 --> 00:49:39.549 line:15%
TRAVIS: You're taking it all up saying, (incomplete words).

1346
00:49:42.680 --> 00:49:45.040 line:15%
LAURA: "What is the shortest route to get to her?"

1347
00:49:47.310 --> 00:49:49.827 line:15%
MATT: The hood curls up a bit, and you see like,

1348
00:49:50.754 --> 00:49:51.810 line:15%
he puts a finger up in a direction

1349
00:49:51.810 --> 00:49:55.958 line:15%
and looking in all, across the path, to all of you, and

1350
00:49:57.983 --> 00:50:00.210
gives a nod to the group

1351
00:50:00.210 --> 00:50:04.045 line:15%
as the attention passes over you and points and goes,

1352
00:50:05.260 --> 00:50:08.090 line:15%
"I think that might be the path you want to take,"

1353
00:50:08.090 --> 00:50:11.820 line:15%
and points, from where you're standing,

1354
00:50:11.820 --> 00:50:15.040 line:15%
you can see it switchbacks a bit and does split

1355
00:50:15.040 --> 00:50:16.750 line:15%
at some point, halfway down the mountain,

1356
00:50:16.750 --> 00:50:20.240 line:15%
as the trees begin to grow more and more dense.

1357
00:50:20.240 --> 00:50:21.340 line:15%
In the direction he's pointing,

1358
00:50:21.340 --> 00:50:23.760 line:15%
it ends up going a little further northwest.

1359
00:50:23.760 --> 00:50:24.593 line:15%
LAURA: Okay.

1360
00:50:30.530 --> 00:50:34.450 line:15%
Is there anything we can do

1361
00:50:34.450 --> 00:50:37.120 line:15%
to help prepare ourselves to meet her?

1362
00:50:38.490 --> 00:50:40.560 line:15%
MATT: "Yes."
LAURA: Aww!

1363
00:50:42.240 --> 00:50:43.073 line:15%
MATT: "It's been wonderful."

1364
00:50:43.073 --> 00:50:45.520 line:15%
LAURA: Oh come on!
(laughter)

1365
00:50:45.520 --> 00:50:46.910 line:15%
MATT: He pinches the edge of your chin.

1366
00:50:46.910 --> 00:50:47.743 line:15%
LIAM: Trickster.

1367
00:50:48.740 --> 00:50:50.944 line:15%
MATT: "Now, I've got to get back to my work."

1368
00:50:50.944 --> 00:50:51.990 line:15%
LAURA: Oh!
MATT: (wind whipping)

1369
00:50:51.990 --> 00:50:53.750 line:15%
He vanishes, and you guys watch

1370
00:50:53.750 --> 00:50:56.090 line:15%
as the cloak swirls, and then this

1371
00:50:56.090 --> 00:51:00.490 line:15%
dull flash of greenish blue light is gone.

1372
00:51:00.490 --> 00:51:02.970 line:15%
LIAM: Caleb, Keen Mind, memorizes the exact path

1373
00:51:02.970 --> 00:51:04.868 line:15%
in relation to the direction north.

1374
00:51:04.868 --> 00:51:05.707 line:15%
MATT: Fair enough.

1375
00:51:05.707 --> 00:51:08.220 line:15%
TRAVIS: Jester, we saw everything!

1376
00:51:08.220 --> 00:51:09.520 line:15%
SAM: That he's real.

1377
00:51:09.520 --> 00:51:11.190 line:15%
LAURA: I know he's real.

1378
00:51:11.190 --> 00:51:12.630 line:15%
TRAVIS: But we heard him also.

1379
00:51:12.630 --> 00:51:13.463 line:15%
That's not--

1380
00:51:13.463 --> 00:51:14.630 line:15%
LAURA: No, you didn't.
LIAM: No, we didn't.

1381
00:51:14.630 --> 00:51:15.463 line:15%
TRAVIS: Did we not?

1382
00:51:15.463 --> 00:51:19.940 line:15%
We heard nothing, but we saw so much!

1383
00:51:19.940 --> 00:51:21.835 line:15%
SAM: It felt like we heard him.

1384
00:51:21.835 --> 00:51:23.395 line:15%
LAURA: Did you see his mouth moving?

1385
00:51:23.395 --> 00:51:26.510 line:15%
MARISHA: Did Beau see something in Asarius?

1386
00:51:26.510 --> 00:51:27.343 line:15%
I'm trying to remember.

1387
00:51:27.343 --> 00:51:28.180 line:15%
Is Beau the only one

1388
00:51:28.180 --> 00:51:30.640 line:15%
who's also actually seen Traveler stuff?

1389
00:51:30.640 --> 00:51:31.473 line:15%
MATT: I think so, yeah.

1390
00:51:31.473 --> 00:51:32.639 line:15%
TRAVIS and MARISHA: In the room.

1391
00:51:32.639 --> 00:51:33.497 line:15%
MARISHA: That's right.

1392
00:51:33.497 --> 00:51:35.310 line:15%
Remember, when we saw that acolyte guy.

1393
00:51:35.310 --> 00:51:36.185 line:15%
LAURA: Oh yeah.
MARISHA: Yeah, yeah, yeah,

1394
00:51:36.185 --> 00:51:37.680 line:15%
yeah, yeah.
LAURA: That's right.

1395
00:51:37.680 --> 00:51:39.280 line:15%
SAM: I will say this.

1396
00:51:39.280 --> 00:51:41.339 line:15%
He's very handsome.
LAURA: Well!

1397
00:51:41.339 --> 00:51:42.250 line:15%
MARISHA: He was floating cloak.

1398
00:51:42.250 --> 00:51:43.800 line:15%
LAURA: You also can't see his face very much.

1399
00:51:43.800 --> 00:51:44.633 line:15%
LIAM: Yeah, all I saw was a cloak.

1400
00:51:44.633 --> 00:51:46.680 line:15%
LAURA: You can tell from, like, his posture.
SAM: I could tell from his posture!

1401
00:51:46.680 --> 00:51:47.890 line:15%
LAURA: And did you see the bottom of his chin?

1402
00:51:47.890 --> 00:51:48.880 line:15%
I saw his chin that time.

1403
00:51:48.880 --> 00:51:50.430 line:15%
SAM: He held himself with confidence,

1404
00:51:50.430 --> 00:51:53.480 line:15%
the way he sort of pointed and gestured, like a ballerina.

1405
00:51:53.480 --> 00:51:55.230 line:15%
LAURA: I know, he was very graceful.

1406
00:51:55.230 --> 00:51:57.430 line:15%
There's this one point where he went like this.

1407
00:51:57.430 --> 00:51:58.850 line:15%
TRAVIS: He's not *that** handsome.

1408
00:51:58.850 --> 00:52:00.590 line:15%
You're just attracted to mystery or something.

1409
00:52:00.590 --> 00:52:01.593 line:15%
I mean, you barely saw his face.

1410
00:52:01.593 --> 00:52:03.660 line:15%
SAM: Who isn't attracted to mystery?

1411
00:52:04.540 --> 00:52:05.940 line:15%
I mean, yes, of course I am.

1412
00:52:05.940 --> 00:52:07.000 line:15%
TRAVIS: I'm not, no.

1413
00:52:07.000 --> 00:52:11.240 line:15%
I like very upfront delivery of goods.

1414
00:52:11.240 --> 00:52:12.215 line:15%
LAURA: Delivery of goods?

1415
00:52:12.215 --> 00:52:15.160 line:15%
TRAVIS: No, no, no shady biz.

1416
00:52:15.160 --> 00:52:17.144 line:15%
SAM: I'll say this about you.
MARISHA: (snickers)

1417
00:52:17.144 --> 00:52:20.358 line:15%
SAM: You were a lot more handsome and attractive

1418
00:52:20.358 --> 00:52:21.949 line:15%
before we knew everything about you.

1419
00:52:21.949 --> 00:52:24.449 line:15%
(laughter)

1420
00:52:25.980 --> 00:52:29.480 line:15%
When you were a mysterious orphan with mysterious ties

1421
00:52:29.480 --> 00:52:32.660 line:15%
to a strange water god, that was sexy.

1422
00:52:32.660 --> 00:52:36.694 line:15%
Now you're just some creeper who--

1423
00:52:36.694 --> 00:52:38.360 line:15%
MARISHA: What? Nott!

1424
00:52:38.360 --> 00:52:40.270 line:15%
LIAM: I think it was more the accent, really.

1425
00:52:40.270 --> 00:52:41.280 line:15%
SAM: That, too.
LIAM: Yeah.

1426
00:52:41.280 --> 00:52:42.280 line:15%
SAM: This accent is so plain.
LAURA: What?!

1427
00:52:42.280 --> 00:52:43.710 line:15%
TRAVIS: This might be the worst thing anyone's

1428
00:52:43.710 --> 00:52:44.543 line:15%
ever said to me, ever.
LAURA: That's not plain!

1429
00:52:44.543 --> 00:52:46.540 line:15%
MARISHA: It's insanely harsh.
TRAVIS: And I grew up

1430
00:52:46.540 --> 00:52:48.098 line:15%
in an orphanage, yeah.

1431
00:52:48.098 --> 00:52:50.270 line:15%
LAURA: I think your accent now is wonderful.

1432
00:52:50.270 --> 00:52:53.230 line:15%
LIAM: So do I, but I just have never heard it.

1433
00:52:53.230 --> 00:52:55.590 line:15%
LAURA: I had heard that other accent plenty, Fjord,

1434
00:52:55.590 --> 00:52:57.010 line:15%
and I like this one more.

1435
00:52:57.010 --> 00:52:57.853 line:15%
LIAM: Maybe it's the Menagerie Coast.

1436
00:52:57.853 --> 00:52:59.955 line:15%
ASHLEY: Have you ever seen a face?

1437
00:52:59.955 --> 00:53:01.163 line:15%
SAM: I see Fjord all the time,

1438
00:53:01.163 --> 00:53:02.537 line:15%
but it still doesn't change the fact

1439
00:53:02.537 --> 00:53:04.470 line:15%
that he's not that attractive.

1440
00:53:05.370 --> 00:53:06.710 line:15%
LAURA: Fjord, you're very handsome.

1441
00:53:06.710 --> 00:53:08.370 line:15%
He's very handsome.
MARISHA: Not everyone can be

1442
00:53:08.370 --> 00:53:11.060 line:15%
a centaur or whatever, okay?

1443
00:53:11.060 --> 00:53:12.400 line:15%
LAURA: It was not a centaur.

1444
00:53:12.400 --> 00:53:13.250 line:15%
It was a minotaur.

1445
00:53:13.250 --> 00:53:16.970 line:15%
SAM: Yeah, I got what she meant.
MARISHA: Whatever!

1446
00:53:16.970 --> 00:53:19.440 line:15%
LAURA: I saw his face when I was younger,

1447
00:53:20.420 --> 00:53:23.605 line:15%
but that was when he looked like, you know, younger.

1448
00:53:23.605 --> 00:53:25.580 line:15%
Then as he started to get older,

1449
00:53:25.580 --> 00:53:27.430 line:15%
like he stopped showing his face as much,

1450
00:53:27.430 --> 00:53:30.113 line:15%
so I only know what he looked like as a kid.

1451
00:53:31.850 --> 00:53:34.110 line:15%
ASHLEY: He was a kid when you met him?

1452
00:53:34.110 --> 00:53:34.943 line:15%
LAURA: Well, yeah.

1453
00:53:36.000 --> 00:53:37.170 line:15%
ASHLEY: Huh.

1454
00:53:37.170 --> 00:53:39.090 line:15%
LAURA: He was, like, a couple of years older than me.

1455
00:53:39.090 --> 00:53:40.580 line:15%
SAM: Well, you said that he sort of was

1456
00:53:40.580 --> 00:53:42.910 line:15%
whatever you needed at the time, right,

1457
00:53:42.910 --> 00:53:44.920 line:15%
like his appearance changes?

1458
00:53:44.920 --> 00:53:45.753 line:15%
ASHLEY: Oh, that's right.

1459
00:53:45.753 --> 00:53:46.586 line:15%
LIAM: Is that what you said?

1460
00:53:46.586 --> 00:53:48.810 line:15%
LIAM: Old stories are filled with
tales of the gods taking on

1461
00:53:48.810 --> 00:53:50.590 line:15%
whatever form they want, so.

1462
00:53:50.590 --> 00:53:52.570 line:15%
SAM: I thought you said something like that,

1463
00:53:52.570 --> 00:53:53.550 line:15%
or maybe I just thought that

1464
00:53:53.550 --> 00:53:55.300 line:15%
when you were telling us about him.

1465
00:53:56.560 --> 00:53:59.420 line:15%
LAURA: Maybe that's what it is.

1466
00:53:59.420 --> 00:54:00.253 line:15%
I don't know.

1467
00:54:01.640 --> 00:54:04.200 line:15%
SAM: Either way, super cool and mysterious.

1468
00:54:04.200 --> 00:54:05.760 line:15%
LIAM: We know you got a direction.

1469
00:54:05.760 --> 00:54:07.450 line:15%
LAURA: Yeah.
LIAM: That way.

1470
00:54:07.450 --> 00:54:08.283 line:15%
Anything else?

1471
00:54:09.650 --> 00:54:11.238 line:15%
LAURA: You know, he's tricky.

1472
00:54:12.490 --> 00:54:16.600 line:15%
He told me that killing her would definitely

1473
00:54:16.600 --> 00:54:17.760 line:15%
take care of the curse.

1474
00:54:17.760 --> 00:54:18.990
SAM: (crossbow loading)

1475
00:54:18.990 --> 00:54:21.540 line:15%
LAURA: He also made it seem like maybe there were other ways

1476
00:54:21.540 --> 00:54:23.059 line:15%
to take care of the curse.

1477
00:54:23.059 --> 00:54:23.992
SAM: (crossbow unloading)

1478
00:54:23.992 --> 00:54:27.467 line:15%
LAURA: But killing her (snaps), solid.

1479
00:54:27.467 --> 00:54:28.775 line:15%
SAM: (crossbow loading)

1480
00:54:28.775 --> 00:54:30.390 line:15%
LAURA: Then I tried to ask another question,

1481
00:54:30.390 --> 00:54:32.250 line:15%
and he just fucked me over,

1482
00:54:32.250 --> 00:54:33.083 line:15%
but that's okay.
SAM: So wait,

1483
00:54:33.083 --> 00:54:35.650 line:15%
is he so tricky and trickster-y that, like,

1484
00:54:35.650 --> 00:54:37.480 line:15%
if he said she's that way,

1485
00:54:37.480 --> 00:54:39.170 line:15%
he was tricking you?
LAURA: No, no, no,

1486
00:54:39.170 --> 00:54:40.620 line:15%
no, no, no, no.
SAM: Okay, okay.

1487
00:54:40.620 --> 00:54:41.930 line:15%
LAURA: No.
SAM: Okay.

1488
00:54:41.930 --> 00:54:44.211 line:15%
LIAM: He pulled one over on you, you are saying?

1489
00:54:44.211 --> 00:54:45.940 line:15%
LAURA: (sighs)

1490
00:54:45.940 --> 00:54:48.600 line:15%
You know, that's the first time that, like,

1491
00:54:48.600 --> 00:54:50.220 line:15%
I mean, I've tried that spell before,

1492
00:54:50.220 --> 00:54:55.220 line:15%
but that's the first time he really, like, stuck to it.

1493
00:54:55.625 --> 00:54:58.120 line:15%
(groans) Maybe he's becoming more powerful,

1494
00:54:58.120 --> 00:55:00.270 line:15%
and he doesn't have time for little spells.

1495
00:55:02.080 --> 00:55:03.510 line:15%
SAM: Well, let's proceed on.

1496
00:55:03.510 --> 00:55:05.608 line:15%
LAURA: Okay.
SAM: Gather your--

1497
00:55:05.608 --> 00:55:06.740 line:15%
LAURA: (gasps) Oh!

1498
00:55:06.740 --> 00:55:09.870 line:15%
I leave one on the rock, so anybody else

1499
00:55:09.870 --> 00:55:11.990 line:15%
that comes along can pray to him as well.

1500
00:55:11.990 --> 00:55:12.970 line:15%
MATT: All right.

1501
00:55:12.970 --> 00:55:14.170 line:15%
LAURA: I can make so many more.

1502
00:55:14.170 --> 00:55:15.552 line:15%
I have a lot of paint.

1503
00:55:15.552 --> 00:55:16.860 line:15%
LIAM: Hiya!

1504
00:55:16.860 --> 00:55:17.760 line:15%
ASHLEY: Hiya!
(laughter)

1505
00:55:17.760 --> 00:55:19.960 line:15%
MATT: Getting back on your horse,

1506
00:55:19.960 --> 00:55:23.000 line:15%
you make your way down the pathway, over the next few hours,

1507
00:55:23.000 --> 00:55:25.610 line:15%
until eventually, you see where the path splits,

1508
00:55:25.610 --> 00:55:28.940 line:15%
and the trees grow more and more dense and taller.

1509
00:55:28.940 --> 00:55:30.640 line:15%
Taking the path that you were guided to,

1510
00:55:30.640 --> 00:55:32.990 line:15%
in a northwest direction, by the Traveler,

1511
00:55:32.990 --> 00:55:36.600 line:15%
you begin to make your way underneath the darkened canopy

1512
00:55:36.600 --> 00:55:38.510 line:15%
of the forest that claims this valley.

1513
00:55:38.510 --> 00:55:40.080 line:15%
LIAM: We're moving slower now, right, because we're--

1514
00:55:40.080 --> 00:55:41.800 line:15%
MATT: You have to, yeah.
LIAM: We're on the roots, okay.

1515
00:55:41.800 --> 00:55:43.950 line:15%
MATT: You're moving faster than a walking pace,

1516
00:55:45.230 --> 00:55:47.850 line:15%
but not at a full horseback riding pace,

1517
00:55:47.850 --> 00:55:49.580 line:15%
because the pathway moves,

1518
00:55:49.580 --> 00:55:51.920 line:15%
and there are trees in the way.

1519
00:55:51.920 --> 00:55:54.990 line:15%
LIAM: I'm going to send Frumpkin
the raven up into the treetops

1520
00:55:54.990 --> 00:55:56.850 line:15%
to go from branch to branch, occasionally look down

1521
00:55:56.850 --> 00:55:58.520 line:15%
at myself to make sure I'm not going to fall off,

1522
00:55:58.520 --> 00:56:02.491 line:15%
but stay ahead and try to peer ahead, a little bit.

1523
00:56:02.491 --> 00:56:04.200 line:15%
MATT: Who is at the front of this?

1524
00:56:04.200 --> 00:56:07.120 line:15%
Who is guiding essentially the party

1525
00:56:07.120 --> 00:56:08.930 line:15%
through the dangers of the woods?

1526
00:56:08.930 --> 00:56:11.420 line:15%
SAM: Is it survival or perception?

1527
00:56:11.420 --> 00:56:14.760 line:15%
MATT: Generally, I would say either-or.

1528
00:56:14.760 --> 00:56:16.907 line:15%
The DC is easier for survival.

1529
00:56:19.050 --> 00:56:20.790 line:15%
LIAM: And Frumpkin will assist whoever's--

1530
00:56:20.790 --> 00:56:22.120 line:15%
MARISHA: My survival's okay.

1531
00:56:22.120 --> 00:56:23.420 line:15%
LAURA: It's okay, mine's okay.

1532
00:56:23.420 --> 00:56:24.630 line:15%
SAM: I'm drinking.

1533
00:56:24.630 --> 00:56:25.463 line:15%
MARISHA: Oh, okay.

1534
00:56:26.441 --> 00:56:28.790 line:15%
MATT: I would say Frumpkin would be its own separate roll,

1535
00:56:28.790 --> 00:56:31.350 line:15%
because it is not actually with them, looking ahead.

1536
00:56:31.350 --> 00:56:32.640 line:15%
TALIESIN: I'll assist then.

1537
00:56:32.640 --> 00:56:34.060 line:15%
MARISHA: Okay, I'll guide.

1538
00:56:34.060 --> 00:56:35.400 line:15%
I feel vaguely responsible.

1539
00:56:35.400 --> 00:56:40.400 line:15%
MATT: Okay, you going perception or survival?

1540
00:56:40.720 --> 00:56:42.590 line:15%
MARISHA: Survival.

1541
00:56:42.590 --> 00:56:43.970 line:15%
MATT: Okay.

1542
00:56:43.970 --> 00:56:45.490 line:15%
So we're essentially beginning

1543
00:56:45.490 --> 00:56:48.170 line:15%
what is a traveling skill challenge.

1544
00:56:48.170 --> 00:56:50.490 line:15%
So you're taking survival as the first part

1545
00:56:50.490 --> 00:56:51.323 line:15%
of the skill challenge.

1546
00:56:51.323 --> 00:56:52.240 line:15%
MARISHA: Okay.
LAURA: Oh!

1547
00:56:52.240 --> 00:56:53.760 line:15%
TALIESIN: You have advantage, though.

1548
00:56:53.760 --> 00:56:54.990 line:15%
LAURA: Guidance!

1549
00:56:54.990 --> 00:56:59.717 line:15%
MATT: As part of this journey, you require four victories.

1550
00:56:59.717 --> 00:57:00.940 line:15%
LAURA: Ooh.

1551
00:57:00.940 --> 00:57:02.950 line:15%
SAM: Four victories out of how many tries?

1552
00:57:02.950 --> 00:57:04.260 line:15%
We don't know.
MATT: As many tries as you want.

1553
00:57:04.260 --> 00:57:05.270 line:15%
SAM: Oh.
MATT: But four victories

1554
00:57:05.270 --> 00:57:06.103 line:15%
to complete your journey.

1555
00:57:06.103 --> 00:57:07.510 line:15%
For every failure, I roll here,

1556
00:57:07.510 --> 00:57:08.660 line:15%
to see what you encounter.

1557
00:57:08.660 --> 00:57:10.710 line:15%
LAURA: Oh!
TRAVIS: Oh, yes!

1558
00:57:10.710 --> 00:57:11.750 line:15%
LAURA: Hot!
LIAM: I don't want

1559
00:57:11.750 --> 00:57:12.583 line:15%
to complicate this.

1560
00:57:12.583 --> 00:57:15.270 line:15%
Frumpkin comes to my shoulder.
TRAVIS: Here, roll bad!

1561
00:57:15.270 --> 00:57:16.511 line:15%
MARISHA: I know!

1562
00:57:16.511 --> 00:57:18.068 line:15%
Roll bad!
LIAM: Don't fuck this up

1563
00:57:18.068 --> 00:57:19.452 line:15%
for us, Marisha!
LAURA: Guidance, Guidance!

1564
00:57:19.452 --> 00:57:20.293 line:15%
LIAM: Goddamn you!

1565
00:57:20.293 --> 00:57:21.510 line:15%
MARISHA: I rolled a natural 20.

1566
00:57:21.510 --> 00:57:23.160 line:15%
I'm so sorry.
LAURA: Add a d4, add a d4.

1567
00:57:23.160 --> 00:57:24.520 line:15%
MARISHA: Oh, plus four.
LIAM: She had a 20.

1568
00:57:24.520 --> 00:57:25.870 line:15%
MARISHA: Oh wait, plus my d4.

1569
00:57:25.870 --> 00:57:26.703 line:15%
SAM: Wait, she got a 20.

1570
00:57:26.703 --> 00:57:27.930 line:15%
MARISHA: I got a natural 20.

1571
00:57:27.930 --> 00:57:28.763 line:15%
SAM and LAURA: Oh!

1572
00:57:28.763 --> 00:57:29.630 line:15%
TRAVIS: Yeah, but we got to see what she rolled.

1573
00:57:29.630 --> 00:57:31.300 line:15%
MARISHA: 25, total.

1574
00:57:31.300 --> 00:57:32.960 line:15%
MATT: 25.
LAURA: Natural 20 isn't bad.

1575
00:57:32.960 --> 00:57:34.760 line:15%
LIAM: Because we want low, so we can fight a monster.

1576
00:57:34.760 --> 00:57:35.593
LAURA: Oh!

1577
00:57:35.593 --> 00:57:37.788 line:15%
TRAVIS: I want that astral dreadnought
to come out and be like,

1578
00:57:37.788 --> 00:57:39.491 line:15%
"You're inside me!"

1579
00:57:39.491 --> 00:57:42.730 line:15%
(laughter)

1580
00:57:42.730 --> 00:57:46.190 line:15%
MATT: All righty, so as you continue forward--

1581
00:57:46.190 --> 00:57:47.371 line:15%
TRAVIS: Beautiful death.

1582
00:57:47.371 --> 00:57:49.130 line:15%
MATT: Dark wizard music here, sound.

1583
00:57:50.340 --> 00:57:52.540 line:15%
Pushing forward for the first leg of this journey,

1584
00:57:52.540 --> 00:57:56.260 line:15%
deep into the overgrowth and dense forest

1585
00:57:56.260 --> 00:57:58.150 line:15%
that claim the middle of this valley,

1586
00:57:59.000 --> 00:58:00.300 line:15%
Beauregard keeps a keen eye,

1587
00:58:00.300 --> 00:58:02.690 line:15%
with Caduceus holding up the rear.

1588
00:58:02.690 --> 00:58:03.910 line:15%
Both eyes ahead, you watch

1589
00:58:03.910 --> 00:58:06.050 line:15%
as the path curls and turns,

1590
00:58:06.050 --> 00:58:09.200 line:15%
and there is one element where the path seems

1591
00:58:09.200 --> 00:58:11.390 line:15%
to become a bit difficult to follow.

1592
00:58:11.390 --> 00:58:13.590 line:15%
The overgrowth has claimed a lot of it.

1593
00:58:13.590 --> 00:58:16.050 line:15%
But your keen eyes combine and manages

1594
00:58:16.050 --> 00:58:17.560 line:15%
to find the remnants of it.

1595
00:58:17.560 --> 00:58:19.200 line:15%
After about another hour of travel,

1596
00:58:19.200 --> 00:58:21.610 line:15%
keeping a very close eye on where you're going,

1597
00:58:21.610 --> 00:58:22.920 line:15%
the trail picks up once more,

1598
00:58:22.920 --> 00:58:25.464 line:15%
and you prevent yourselves from being lost.

1599
00:58:25.464 --> 00:58:27.270 line:15%
LAURA: Oh shit.

1600
00:58:27.270 --> 00:58:29.430 line:15%
MATT: Who would like to take the next leg?

1601
00:58:29.430 --> 00:58:31.220 line:15%
TALIESIN: I'll take the next leg.
MATT: With whatever skill

1602
00:58:31.220 --> 00:58:34.410 line:15%
you think would be appropriate to apply to this journey.

1603
00:58:34.410 --> 00:58:36.070 line:15%
TALIESIN: Oh, so you would say change off

1604
00:58:36.070 --> 00:58:37.240 line:15%
from survival to something else?

1605
00:58:37.240 --> 00:58:38.073 line:15%
MATT: You could do survival again,

1606
00:58:38.073 --> 00:58:40.020 line:15%
but the DC will be higher, this time.

1607
00:58:40.020 --> 00:58:41.410 line:15%
You can keep doing the same skill,

1608
00:58:41.410 --> 00:58:43.200 line:15%
but it gets higher.
TALIESIN: I'll take the perception,

1609
00:58:43.200 --> 00:58:45.550 line:15%
just since we're just seeing if we're going to hit everything.

1610
00:58:45.550 --> 00:58:47.047 line:15%
I'll do a...

1611
00:58:52.010 --> 00:58:52.843 line:15%
Or actually, you know what?

1612
00:58:52.843 --> 00:58:53.820 line:15%
I'll do animal handling.

1613
00:58:53.820 --> 00:58:56.540 line:15%
I'm going to talk to my horse and let them know:

1614
00:58:56.540 --> 00:58:59.660 line:15%
Hey, trail's getting a little rough, so I need you

1615
00:58:59.660 --> 00:59:02.780 line:15%
to keep a very, very, very close eye on things.

1616
00:59:02.780 --> 00:59:04.800 line:15%
Things might get a little rough.

1617
00:59:04.800 --> 00:59:08.130 line:15%
MATT: All right, so leaning into the horse's instincts

1618
00:59:08.130 --> 00:59:10.360 line:15%
to guide you in the proper path away from danger,

1619
00:59:10.360 --> 00:59:12.190 line:15%
you go ahead and speak to it, pat it gently

1620
00:59:12.190 --> 00:59:13.973 line:15%
and hope that it knows the way. Go ahead.

1621
00:59:13.973 --> 00:59:15.770 line:15%
TALIESIN: Is anyone assisting, or am I just blind?

1622
00:59:15.770 --> 00:59:17.330 line:15%
TRAVIS: With fucking animal handling?

1623
00:59:17.330 --> 00:59:18.280 line:15%
LAURA: I'm going to assist.

1624
00:59:18.280 --> 00:59:20.510 line:15%
I'll pat my horse too, and go: Hey, you hear--

1625
00:59:20.510 --> 00:59:21.390 line:15%
TALIESIN: I don't know if it mattered.

1626
00:59:21.390 --> 00:59:22.560 line:15%
LAURA: Do you hear how Caduceus is talking to--

1627
00:59:22.560 --> 00:59:24.310 line:15%
MATT: Sure.
TALIESIN: Okay, I mean.

1628
00:59:25.390 --> 00:59:27.530 line:15%
I'm giving myself Guidance, because what the heck?

1629
00:59:27.530 --> 00:59:28.915 line:15%
MATT: Okay.

1630
00:59:28.915 --> 00:59:30.920 line:15%
SAM: I'll tell my horse: Go the right way!

1631
00:59:30.920 --> 00:59:31.770 line:15%
TALIESIN: That's not too good.

1632
00:59:31.770 --> 00:59:32.670 line:15%
That's good.

1633
00:59:32.670 --> 00:59:34.060 line:15%
Actually, okay, it's--

1634
00:59:34.060 --> 00:59:35.030 line:15%
LAURA: It's not bad.

1635
00:59:35.030 --> 00:59:36.570 line:15%
That is not bad.
TALIESIN: 19, 19!

1636
00:59:36.570 --> 00:59:38.300 line:15%
LAURA: 19's good.
MATT: 19, okay.

1637
00:59:38.300 --> 00:59:39.840 line:15%
TRAVIS: It's not terrible.

1638
00:59:39.840 --> 00:59:42.700 line:15%
MATT: This deep into the valley,
the horse confidently begins

1639
00:59:42.700 --> 00:59:44.210 line:15%
to pick up a trot (hooves clopping).

1640
00:59:45.077 --> 00:59:46.150 line:15%
TALIESIN: Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow.
MATT: You guys keep up

1641
00:59:46.150 --> 00:59:49.150 line:15%
behind it (laughs).

1642
00:59:52.462 --> 00:59:55.045 line:15%
LAURA: (laughs)

1643
00:59:56.650 --> 01:00:00.630 line:15%
MATT: The density of the forest grows darker and darker.

1644
01:00:02.198 --> 01:00:04.570 line:15%
You can feel your horse getting nervous.

1645
01:00:04.570 --> 01:00:08.220 line:15%
It begins to give exclamation of (snorts)

1646
01:00:08.220 --> 01:00:09.830 line:15%
and start getting a little strange,

1647
01:00:09.830 --> 01:00:11.920 line:15%
and so it begins to dart off the path a little bit

1648
01:00:11.920 --> 01:00:14.230 line:15%
towards a clearing, where it feels more comfortable.

1649
01:00:14.230 --> 01:00:16.000 line:15%
As you guys follow suit, you come

1650
01:00:16.000 --> 01:00:18.590 line:15%
into an open clearing here, in the middle of the day,

1651
01:00:18.590 --> 01:00:20.400 line:15%
the still-clouded sky above,

1652
01:00:20.400 --> 01:00:24.750 line:15%
but it's a welcome opening to this space,

1653
01:00:24.750 --> 01:00:25.583 line:15%
and as you step out

1654
01:00:25.583 --> 01:00:27.420 line:15%
into it (ihooves clopping).

1655
01:00:27.420 --> 01:00:28.850 line:15%
MARISHA: Caduceus, is this right?

1656
01:00:29.700 --> 01:00:30.880 line:15%
LAURAP: This is pretty.
TALIESIN: We all right?

1657
01:00:30.880 --> 01:00:32.390 line:15%
SAM: Caduceus knows the forest.
MATT: You slow

1658
01:00:32.390 --> 01:00:34.480 line:15%
for a second, a bit, and look around.

1659
01:00:34.480 --> 01:00:36.270 line:15%
The whole clearing is empty

1660
01:00:36.270 --> 01:00:37.920 line:15%
of any sort of woodland creatures.

1661
01:00:37.920 --> 01:00:39.130 line:15%
LAURA: Do we hear any bugs?
LIAM: Hear anything?

1662
01:00:39.130 --> 01:00:41.119 line:15%
MATT: Make a perception check.

1663
01:00:41.119 --> 01:00:43.270 line:15%
LIAM: I'm going, too.

1664
01:00:43.270 --> 01:00:45.090 line:15%
LAURA: Nope, don't hear shit.

1665
01:00:45.090 --> 01:00:46.130 line:15%
LIAM: 14.

1666
01:00:46.130 --> 01:00:48.252 line:15%
MATT: 14.

1667
01:00:48.252 --> 01:00:52.280
You pick up one quick sound (whooshes).

1668
01:00:52.280 --> 01:00:54.563 line:15%
Just in the last minute, you glance up
and you can see a branch

1669
01:00:54.563 --> 01:00:57.670 line:15%
in a tree not far from you bow slightly.

1670
01:00:57.670 --> 01:00:58.780 line:15%
At the end of the branch,

1671
01:00:58.780 --> 01:01:01.463 line:15%
you see what looks to be a bird perched,

1672
01:01:02.770 --> 01:01:05.030 line:15%
mostly a bird, kind of a bird.

1673
01:01:05.030 --> 01:01:07.480 line:15%
You see bird legs grabbing on to it.

1674
01:01:07.480 --> 01:01:08.860 line:15%
You see wings that have folded.

1675
01:01:08.860 --> 01:01:12.800 line:15%
You see the feathers are black and matted,

1676
01:01:12.800 --> 01:01:15.050 line:15%
like they have oil through them.

1677
01:01:15.050 --> 01:01:17.550 line:15%
They have this shine to them,

1678
01:01:17.550 --> 01:01:21.305 line:15%
like they had pulled themselves out of a tar pit.

1679
01:01:21.305 --> 01:01:24.390 line:15%
You can see elements dripping (slurps) off the wings

1680
01:01:24.390 --> 01:01:26.680 line:15%
as they fold and shake and go back into place,

1681
01:01:26.680 --> 01:01:29.030 line:15%
but where the torso is, you see

1682
01:01:29.030 --> 01:01:32.200 line:15%
a gray-skinned female humanoid figure

1683
01:01:32.200 --> 01:01:35.350 line:15%
with long, tattered, red, wild hair

1684
01:01:35.350 --> 01:01:37.020 line:15%
that goes down to about the mid-back,

1685
01:01:37.020 --> 01:01:39.460 line:15%
this mane that pulls to the side,

1686
01:01:39.460 --> 01:01:41.540 line:15%
and you can see these yellow eyes,

1687
01:01:41.540 --> 01:01:42.940 line:15%
peering down as it grins.

1688
01:01:42.940 --> 01:01:44.270 line:15%
It's about 15 feet above you,

1689
01:01:44.270 --> 01:01:45.440 line:15%
and it just stays there and looks at you.

1690
01:01:45.440 --> 01:01:46.350 line:15%
LAURA: Didn't harpies

1691
01:01:46.350 --> 01:01:47.564 line:15%
kill our horses?
LIAM: 15 feet above us right now?

1692
01:01:47.564 --> 01:01:49.160 line:15%
MARISHA: Harpies ate our horses

1693
01:01:49.160 --> 01:01:49.998 line:15%
when we were Vox Machina.
MATT: About 15 feet above you.

1694
01:01:49.998 --> 01:01:51.990 line:15%
LAURA: (laughs) Oh no!

1695
01:01:51.990 --> 01:01:53.830 line:15%
MATT: As you glance up and make eye contact,

1696
01:01:53.830 --> 01:01:58.140 line:15%
it goes (screeches), "You lost, flesh?

1697
01:01:59.280 --> 01:02:02.610 line:15%
"I ask your purpose (snarls).

1698
01:02:02.610 --> 01:02:04.660 line:15%
"Despair makes flesh tasty."

1699
01:02:05.620 --> 01:02:07.530 line:15%
LAURA: Well, it's good that we're so happy then.

1700
01:02:07.530 --> 01:02:09.418 line:15%
SAM: We are very content, yes.

1701
01:02:09.418 --> 01:02:12.272 line:15%
MATT: "(hisses)

1702
01:02:12.272 --> 01:02:13.472 line:15%
"Where you go (snarls)?"

1703
01:02:16.630 --> 01:02:18.770 line:15%
SAM: Uh, we're looking for mushrooms in the woods

1704
01:02:18.770 --> 01:02:21.310 line:15%
for our papa.
LAURA: Mm-hmm.

1705
01:02:21.310 --> 01:02:22.430 line:15%
"MATT: "Papa?"

1706
01:02:22.430 --> 01:02:24.440 line:15%
LAURA: For dinner, for supper, he sent us looking

1707
01:02:24.440 --> 01:02:26.880 line:15%
for mushrooms in the woods.
MATT: "(laughs)" And it starts laughing.

1708
01:02:26.880 --> 01:02:30.670 line:15%
You hear laughter "(laughs)" in the trees around you,

1709
01:02:30.670 --> 01:02:33.370 line:15%
and you glance up and notice now there are numerous

1710
01:02:33.370 --> 01:02:35.230 line:15%
of these creatures that were perched in the trees

1711
01:02:35.230 --> 01:02:39.110 line:15%
that were just waiting, resting, hunting, who knows?

1712
01:02:39.110 --> 01:02:40.850 line:15%
But they're there now.

1713
01:02:40.850 --> 01:02:43.560 line:15%
TRAVIS: We have a meeting with the witch Isharnai.

1714
01:02:43.560 --> 01:02:46.000 line:15%
Do you know her?
MATT: "(snarls)

1715
01:02:46.000 --> 01:02:48.648 line:15%
"We know of her.

1716
01:02:50.140 --> 01:02:51.550 line:15%
"Mean witch."

1717
01:02:52.520 --> 01:02:53.353 line:15%
TRAVIS: Mean witch.

1718
01:02:53.353 --> 01:02:54.640 line:15%
LAURA: Mean witch.
SAM: Witch, she's a witch.

1719
01:02:54.640 --> 01:02:56.548 line:15%
TRAVIS: Mean, mean.

1720
01:02:56.548 --> 01:02:57.560 line:15%
MATT: "(snarls)"

1721
01:02:57.560 --> 01:02:58.860 line:15%
TALIESIN: Why is she mean?

1722
01:03:00.200 --> 01:03:01.340 line:15%
MATT: "You'll find out.

1723
01:03:02.280 --> 01:03:05.450 line:15%
"Or maybe not,"

1724
01:03:05.450 --> 01:03:07.460 line:15%
as she says that, her jaw

1725
01:03:07.460 --> 01:03:09.580 line:15%
hangs open a little longer than it should,

1726
01:03:09.580 --> 01:03:11.420 line:15%
and you see the tongue (slurps) loll out,

1727
01:03:11.420 --> 01:03:14.340 line:15%
and as it does, this darkened spittle (slurps)

1728
01:03:14.340 --> 01:03:17.460 line:15%
flings outward and (splats) spatters into the ground,

1729
01:03:17.460 --> 01:03:18.910 line:15%
about three feet from you.

1730
01:03:18.910 --> 01:03:21.800 line:15%
The horse backs up a bit.

1731
01:03:21.800 --> 01:03:24.530 line:15%
LAURA: This horse led us here!

1732
01:03:24.530 --> 01:03:25.920 line:15%
SAM: I'm going to turn invisible.

1733
01:03:25.920 --> 01:03:30.920 line:15%
LIAM: You wouldn't mind if we had a grievance with her?

1734
01:03:31.450 --> 01:03:36.030 line:15%
Perhaps there is something we could trade to come through.

1735
01:03:36.030 --> 01:03:37.710 line:15%
MATT: "Trade maybe.

1736
01:03:37.710 --> 01:03:39.010 line:15%
"What you have to trade?"

1737
01:03:40.480 --> 01:03:41.410 line:15%
LIAM: Many things.

1738
01:03:41.410 --> 01:03:43.458 line:15%
TRAVIS: Hey, Nott, offer yourself up.

1739
01:03:43.458 --> 01:03:45.403 line:15%
SAM: (through clenched teeth)
I'm invisible.

1740
01:03:45.403 --> 01:03:47.440 line:15%
(laughter)

1741
01:03:47.440 --> 01:03:51.280 line:15%
MATT: Nott's horse's saddle is empty.

1742
01:03:53.150 --> 01:03:56.110 line:15%
MARISHA: Hang on, I pull my horse back.

1743
01:03:56.110 --> 01:03:59.080 line:15%
Nott, get on my horse.

1744
01:03:59.080 --> 01:04:00.190 line:15%
SAM: Oh, okay.

1745
01:04:00.190 --> 01:04:02.880 line:15%
I will stealthily switch horses.

1746
01:04:02.880 --> 01:04:04.640 line:15%
MATT: "What trade?"

1747
01:04:04.640 --> 01:04:08.000 line:15%
LIAM: Caleb holds up a big glass jar full of boba and says:

1748
01:04:08.000 --> 01:04:13.000 line:15%
Perhaps you are hungry for something sweet?

1749
01:04:13.050 --> 01:04:15.180 line:15%
MARISHA: I trot up with the horse

1750
01:04:15.180 --> 01:04:16.900 line:15%
and add the horse to the offering.

1751
01:04:16.900 --> 01:04:18.220 line:15%
LAURA: (gasps)

1752
01:04:18.220 --> 01:04:19.580 line:15%
LIAM: The horse is the sweet part,

1753
01:04:19.580 --> 01:04:21.603 line:15%
and this is for nutritional value.

1754
01:04:21.603 --> 01:04:23.930 line:15%
MATT: "What is in?"

1755
01:04:25.390 --> 01:04:29.160 line:15%
LIAM: This is enough to fill your belly for a day,

1756
01:04:29.160 --> 01:04:31.757 line:15%
and you needn't savage anything.

1757
01:04:32.860 --> 01:04:35.708 line:15%
MATT: (squawking)

1758
01:04:35.708 --> 01:04:37.130 line:15%
You see all the other harpies

1759
01:04:37.130 --> 01:04:39.850 line:15%
in the trees flap down a few branches.

1760
01:04:39.850 --> 01:04:42.360 line:15%
They're still above, but they're much closer

1761
01:04:42.360 --> 01:04:45.390 line:15%
and circling in a bit as the one

1762
01:04:45.390 --> 01:04:47.960 line:15%
that you're talking to, who you can plainly see is larger

1763
01:04:47.960 --> 01:04:51.030 line:15%
than the others and seems to hold a position of power

1764
01:04:51.030 --> 01:04:53.390 line:15%
or leadership within this cluster,

1765
01:04:53.390 --> 01:04:55.890 line:15%
(whooshes) and fly down in your direction,

1766
01:04:57.540 --> 01:04:59.400 line:15%
right towards you (whooshes).

1767
01:04:59.400 --> 01:05:00.990 line:15%
MARISHA: So yays, yays or nays?

1768
01:05:00.990 --> 01:05:02.840 line:15%
No, sorry, keep going, keep going, sorry.

1769
01:05:02.840 --> 01:05:04.450 line:15%
MATT: Then (whooshes),

1770
01:05:04.450 --> 01:05:07.350 line:15%
lands (crackles) on the ground in front of you.

1771
01:05:07.350 --> 01:05:10.075 line:15%
MATT: (clicking) Walks up, right up to the

1772
01:05:10.075 --> 01:05:11.970 line:15%
front and like--
LIAM: Uncorks it.

1773
01:05:11.970 --> 01:05:13.410 line:15%
MATT: The smell is terrible.

1774
01:05:13.410 --> 01:05:15.570 line:15%
You've dealt with seafaring harpies.

1775
01:05:15.570 --> 01:05:18.280 line:15%
These are larger and more grotesque,

1776
01:05:18.280 --> 01:05:22.870 line:15%
both in their hygiene and (sighs),

1777
01:05:22.870 --> 01:05:26.390 line:15%
these are terrifying harpies.

1778
01:05:26.390 --> 01:05:28.370 line:15%
The teeth are much sharper and jagged,

1779
01:05:28.370 --> 01:05:31.520 line:15%
reminiscent of some of the worst goblin jaws you've seen.

1780
01:05:31.520 --> 01:05:34.510 line:15%
It seems that their sweat is a thick oil

1781
01:05:34.510 --> 01:05:36.960 line:15%
that both protects and seeps into their feathers.

1782
01:05:36.960 --> 01:05:39.330 line:15%
That's why they have that glistening shine to them.

1783
01:05:39.330 --> 01:05:42.080 line:15%
The sweat has a dark-brown coloration

1784
01:05:42.080 --> 01:05:44.260 line:15%
to it, where it looks like they had just been doused

1785
01:05:44.260 --> 01:05:47.400 line:15%
in oil or blood of some kind, and it just stayed.

1786
01:05:48.294 --> 01:05:49.900 line:15%
"(snarling)"

1787
01:05:49.900 --> 01:05:53.080 line:15%
LIAM: Caleb is going to lean down and place the jar

1788
01:05:53.080 --> 01:05:57.100 line:15%
into one of the saddlebags of the free horse

1789
01:05:57.100 --> 01:05:59.320 line:15%
and gives it a little nudge on the tuckus.

1790
01:06:00.810 --> 01:06:02.800 line:15%
MATT: She goes ahead and heads up to, you leave it open?

1791
01:06:02.800 --> 01:06:04.411 line:15%
LIAM: Yeah.

1792

MATT: "(slurping)"

1793
01:06:06.730 --> 01:06:08.190 line:15%
LIAM: That's, like, nine days worth.

1794
01:06:09.800 --> 01:06:11.440 line:15%
MATT: Make a persuasion check.

1795
01:06:11.440 --> 01:06:12.780 line:15%
MARISHA: Come on, Caleb.

1796
01:06:12.780 --> 01:06:13.613 line:15%
LIAM: I kind of want to fail it.

1797
01:06:13.613 --> 01:06:14.736 line:15%
I kind of want to fight.

1798
01:06:14.736 --> 01:06:16.510 line:15%
MARISHA: (chuckles) Natural 20.

1799
01:06:16.510 --> 01:06:17.500 line:15%
LIAM: It's a one.

1800
01:06:17.500 --> 01:06:21.580 line:15%
TRAVIS: Oh, is it really?
LAURA: No, no?

1801
01:06:21.580 --> 01:06:23.500 line:15%
Why would you say that?

1802
01:06:23.500 --> 01:06:25.000 line:15%
Because you're rolling.

1803
01:06:25.000 --> 01:06:26.895 line:15%
MATT: (coughing)
LIAM: Got what I wanted.

1804
01:06:26.895 --> 01:06:30.240 line:15%
MATT: (coughing) And just spits them out,

1805
01:06:30.240 --> 01:06:32.326 line:15%
and they (splatting) onto the ground and spatter.

1806
01:06:32.326 --> 01:06:34.191 line:15%

TALIESIN: We were saving that.

TRAVIS: Yasha, Jester, Beau, right?

1905
01:10:05.630 --> 01:10:07.060
MATT: Yup.
MARISHA: Beau, Yasha, Jester.

1906
01:10:07.060 --> 01:10:07.893
MATT: 20 to 15?

1907
01:10:08.750 --> 01:10:09.583
TALIESIN: 15.

1908
01:10:09.583 --> 01:10:11.660
SAM: N-n-nineteen.

1909
01:10:11.660 --> 01:10:13.310
MATT: 19.

1910
01:10:13.310 --> 01:10:14.950
MARISHA: I rolled a 23. What did you say?

1911
01:10:14.950 --> 01:10:16.140
ASHLEY: 22.

1912
01:10:16.140 --> 01:10:17.170
MATT: 15 to 10?

1913
01:10:17.170 --> 01:10:18.590
LIAM: 14.

1914
01:10:18.590 --> 01:10:22.770
MATT: 14 for-- let's see here.

1915
01:10:23.801 --> 01:10:25.690
TRAVIS: I can't.

1916
01:10:25.690 --> 01:10:27.070
MARISHA: What were you?
SAM: N-n-nineteen.

1917
01:10:27.070 --> 01:10:29.130
MATT: Then Fjord, a--?
TRAVIS: 12.

1918
01:10:29.130 --> 01:10:30.970
MATT: 12, got it, all right.

1919
01:10:30.970 --> 01:10:32.620
So the beginning of the round,

1920
01:10:32.620 --> 01:10:34.620
Beau, you are up first with Yasha on deck.

1921
01:10:34.620 --> 01:10:35.650
You can see them now all ready

1922
01:10:35.650 --> 01:10:38.550
to leap off the trees and swarm in.

1923
01:10:38.550 --> 01:10:40.370
MARISHA: So none in range?

1924
01:10:40.370 --> 01:10:41.203
MATT: At the moment, no.

1925
01:10:41.203 --> 01:10:44.596
All you hear is the chorus of screeches all around you.

1926
01:10:44.596 --> 01:10:47.429
(screeching)

1927
01:10:48.750 --> 01:10:52.600
MARISHA: I slap Water Closet and I say: Be free!

1928
01:10:52.600 --> 01:10:54.640
and give him a slap on the ass.

1929
01:10:55.490 --> 01:10:58.870
MATT: All right, taking Nott with it.

1930
01:11:00.925 --> 01:11:01.758
MARISHA: No, no.

1931
01:11:01.758 --> 01:11:03.410
Nott was on mine.

1932
01:11:03.410 --> 01:11:04.900
MATT: Oh, you're slapping the one in front.

1933
01:11:04.900 --> 01:11:06.140
MARISHA: The free one that I was offering.

1934
01:11:06.140 --> 01:11:07.510
MATT: Oh, I see, I see.

1935
01:11:07.510 --> 01:11:08.343
All right, in which you are invisible,

1936
01:11:08.343 --> 01:11:09.830
so I'll put that little marker there.

1937
01:11:09.830 --> 01:11:12.500
MARISHA: Yeah, not that one.
MATT: Okay, sorry.

1938
01:11:12.500 --> 01:11:15.120
Okay, it'll be your action to do that, just as a heads up.

1939
01:11:15.120 --> 01:11:16.230
MARISHA: Oh.
LIAM: Hmm.

1940
01:11:16.230 --> 01:11:18.060
MATT: To reach forward, because you're on horseback,

1941
01:11:18.060 --> 01:11:20.020
to reach forward and slap it enough to send it off,

1942
01:11:20.020 --> 01:11:20.853
that'll be your action.

1943
01:11:20.853 --> 01:11:22.730
MARISHA: Bonus action, Patient Defense.

1944
01:11:22.730 --> 01:11:25.110
That's what I was going to do.
MATT: Okay, got it.

1945
01:11:25.110 --> 01:11:28.114
I'll say as part of that, the horse runs off.

1946
01:11:28.114 --> 01:11:30.040
MARISHA: Hopefully, he's a distraction. I don't know.

1947
01:11:30.040 --> 01:11:30.960
LAURA: Maybe.
MATT: We'll say at the top,

1948
01:11:30.960 --> 01:11:32.440
so it just swoops and can then use

1949
01:11:32.440 --> 01:11:34.360
galloping away at the moment.
LAURA: One horse makes it.

1950
01:11:34.360 --> 01:11:35.920
MATT: Patient Defense with that bonus action.

1951
01:11:35.920 --> 01:11:37.050
Yasha, you're up first.

1952
01:11:37.050 --> 01:11:38.720
Jester, you're on deck.
ASHLEY and LAURA: Okay.

1953
01:11:38.720 --> 01:11:40.354
ASHLEY: I would like to rage.

1954
01:11:40.354 --> 01:11:42.009
TRAVIS: Yeah!

1955
01:11:42.009 --> 01:11:43.109
MATT: You got it.
ASHLEY: Okay.

1956
01:11:44.577 --> 01:11:45.467
MARISHA: Beautiful.

1957
01:11:45.467 --> 01:11:47.146
LIAM: That's like a dot-com.

1958
01:11:47.146 --> 01:11:48.590
ASHLEY: ♪ Dot-Com ♪

1959
01:11:48.590 --> 01:11:53.590
Okay, so could I jump off my horse?

1960
01:11:54.520 --> 01:11:56.550
I mean, will that be considered an action,

1961
01:11:56.550 --> 01:11:57.460
if I jump off the horse?

1962
01:11:57.460 --> 01:11:58.880
MATT: No, jumping off would be half your movement.

1963
01:11:58.880 --> 01:12:00.520
ASHLEY: All right, I'm going to jump off the horse

1964
01:12:00.520 --> 01:12:05.520
and start running towards this bitch over here.

1965
01:12:06.050 --> 01:12:06.883
MATT: Here?

1966
01:12:06.883 --> 01:12:08.490
ASHLEY: Yeah.
MATT: Two, three.

1967
01:12:08.490 --> 01:12:10.940
You can get right underneath it.

1968
01:12:10.940 --> 01:12:12.556
ASHLEY: Great.
MATT: It's not within range, though.

1969
01:12:12.556 --> 01:12:13.980
ASHLEY: Not within range?
MATT: No.

1970
01:12:13.980 --> 01:12:15.630
ASHLEY: Okay.
MATT: It's about 10 feet up.

1971
01:12:15.630 --> 01:12:16.710
ASHLEY: Fuck!

1972
01:12:16.710 --> 01:12:19.550
Okay, so I will just--

1973
01:12:21.870 --> 01:12:23.060
I'll just rage and--

1974
01:12:24.883 --> 01:12:26.160
MATT: You can hold your action if you want to.

1975
01:12:26.160 --> 01:12:27.790
ASHLEY: I'll tell it to come down, when it's in range.

1976
01:12:27.790 --> 01:12:29.060
MATT: Okay, so when it comes within range,

1977
01:12:29.060 --> 01:12:30.240
you'll make an attack?
ASHLEY: Yes.

1978
01:12:30.240 --> 01:12:31.073
MATT: You got it.

1979
01:12:31.073 --> 01:12:32.320
All right, that finishes your go.

1980
01:12:32.320 --> 01:12:33.910
Jester, you're up.

1981
01:12:33.910 --> 01:12:36.457
LAURA: I'm going to...

1982
01:12:38.968 --> 01:12:40.101
cast...

1983
01:12:43.960 --> 01:12:45.880
Spiritual Guardians!

1984
01:12:45.880 --> 01:12:48.750
MATT: Spiritual Guardians, okay.
LAURA: At 5th-level.

1985
01:12:48.750 --> 01:12:51.330
MATT: Oh, damn, what's the radius on that, again?

1986
01:12:51.330 --> 01:12:54.940
LAURA: That is 15 feet around me.

1987
01:12:54.940 --> 01:12:56.840
MATT: 15 feet around you, all right.

1988
01:12:56.840 --> 01:12:58.810
We'll go ahead and put it--

1989
01:12:58.810 --> 01:13:03.810
LAURA: So a array of really buff-looking,

1990
01:13:03.900 --> 01:13:06.430
pink, flying unicorns.

1991
01:13:07.480 --> 01:13:09.730
They're really muscly, because they're 5th-level.

1992
01:13:09.730 --> 01:13:10.563
MATT: Mm-hmm.

1993
01:13:10.563 --> 01:13:12.760
LAURA: Some of them have, like, two horns.

1994
01:13:12.760 --> 01:13:14.160
MATT: Nice, nice.
LAURA: Yeah.

1995
01:13:14.160 --> 01:13:17.410
And, like, razor claws

1996
01:13:17.410 --> 01:13:18.920
for their hooves.

1997
01:13:18.920 --> 01:13:20.020
MATT: Okay, so with

1998
01:13:20.020 --> 01:13:22.074
that situated in place.
SAM: Protect everyone or just you?

1999
01:13:22.074 --> 01:13:23.460
LAURA: Anything that enters

2000
01:13:23.460 --> 01:13:25.990
within the 15-foot radius of me gets,

2001
01:13:26.850 --> 01:13:28.240
that I don't designate,

2002
01:13:28.240 --> 01:13:30.160
anybody that's a friend doesn't get attacked.

2003
01:13:30.160 --> 01:13:30.993
MATT: Correct.

2004
01:13:30.993 --> 01:13:34.120
LAURA: They'll take 5d8.

2005
01:13:34.120 --> 01:13:36.290
MATT: By that rule, you guys would be dead a long time ago.

2006
01:13:36.290 --> 01:13:38.123
TALIESIN: Fair.
MATT: All right, so you have that situated.

2007
01:13:38.123 --> 01:13:39.540
Are you going to stay in place, or are you going to try

2008
01:13:39.540 --> 01:13:41.580
and kick your horse to move somewhere?

2009
01:13:41.580 --> 01:13:45.100
I'm going to try to stay within
range of everybody around me,

2010
01:13:45.100 --> 01:13:47.060
to try to give them protection,

2011
01:13:47.060 --> 01:13:49.140
since I'm in the middle here.

2012
01:13:49.140 --> 01:13:51.590
So I'm going to stay in the middle as much as I can.

2013
01:13:51.590 --> 01:13:53.132
I need to move forward

2014
01:13:53.132 --> 01:13:54.040
a little bit.
MATT: Move forward a little bit,

2015
01:13:54.040 --> 01:13:55.530
probably would be the best way to handle that,

2016
01:13:55.530 --> 01:13:58.020
so you move forward, to there, on horseback.

2017
01:13:58.020 --> 01:13:58.920
LAURA: Sure.

2018
01:13:58.920 --> 01:13:59.980
MATT: All right.

2019
01:13:59.980 --> 01:14:02.500
Then we'll say you'll put pretty much everybody

2020
01:14:02.500 --> 01:14:05.870
within the radius, with you on top of the horse.

2021
01:14:05.870 --> 01:14:06.830
LAURA: Cool.
MATT: Got it.

2022
01:14:06.830 --> 01:14:08.890
That finish your turn, Jester?

2023
01:14:08.890 --> 01:14:10.240
LAURA: Yeah, because my bonus is,

2024
01:14:10.240 --> 01:14:12.550
I don't think I have much of anything.

2025
01:14:12.550 --> 01:14:14.610
MATT: All righty, it is now the gorefeather harpies' turn.

2026
01:14:14.610 --> 01:14:17.377
SAM: Fuck.
MARISHA: Gorefeather harpy.

2027
01:14:17.377 --> 01:14:19.170
SAM: Gorefeather!

2028
01:14:19.170 --> 01:14:21.281
The gorefeather harpy invented the internet.

2029
01:14:21.281 --> 01:14:23.677
MARISHA: (laughs)

2030
01:14:23.677 --> 01:14:25.670
MARISHA: That was good.
MATT: This one swoops down here.

2031
01:14:25.670 --> 01:14:30.658
This one swoops down here to pincer attack Fjord,

2032
01:14:30.658 --> 01:14:34.380
just outside of the radius of the unicorns.

2033
01:14:34.380 --> 01:14:35.358
LAURA: Sorry, Fjord.

2034
01:14:35.358 --> 01:14:36.581
TRAVIS: It's okay.

2035
01:14:36.581 --> 01:14:41.060
MATT: This one here's going to swoop down

2036
01:14:41.060 --> 01:14:43.570
to attack you, Caduceus.

2037
01:14:43.570 --> 01:14:47.995
This one is going to go swoop down towards you, Yasha.

2038
01:14:47.995 --> 01:14:50.090
This one is going to head in towards Beau.

2039
01:14:51.150 --> 01:14:52.250
Let's say right there.

2040
01:14:54.234 --> 01:14:55.970
MARISHA: What do the guardians do?

2041
01:14:55.970 --> 01:14:56.960
MATT: The one that's going after Beau,

2042
01:14:56.960 --> 01:15:00.300
I think will just touch the radius.

2043
01:15:00.300 --> 01:15:01.690
LAURA: Awesome!

2044
01:15:01.690 --> 01:15:03.160
MATT: Most likely.

2045
01:15:03.160 --> 01:15:05.400
So is it a wisdom save?

2046
01:15:05.400 --> 01:15:07.420
LAURA: Let me see, wisdom save, yes.

2047
01:15:08.460 --> 01:15:10.930
MATT: That is going to be a 10.

2048
01:15:10.930 --> 01:15:12.190
LAURA: Woo, failed!

2049
01:15:12.190 --> 01:15:16.194
So that is 5d8 radiant damage.
MATT: Roll damage on that.

2050
01:15:16.194 --> 01:15:19.371
MARISHA: Oh fuck!
LAURA: Yeah!

2051
01:15:19.371 --> 01:15:23.617
♪ Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah ♪

2052
01:15:23.617 --> 01:15:26.284
♪ Huh, huh, huh ♪

2053
01:15:27.430 --> 01:15:29.480
11, 12, 13, 14.

2054
01:15:32.604 --> 01:15:35.620
14, 21,

2055
01:15:35.620 --> 01:15:38.870
25, 26, 32.

2056
01:15:38.870 --> 01:15:40.270
TRAVIS: Damn.
MATT: Woo!

2057
01:15:41.330 --> 01:15:43.580
As it swoops in, its claws up in the air,

2058
01:15:43.580 --> 01:15:47.560
going in towards Beauregard, it immediately gets slammed

2059
01:15:47.560 --> 01:15:50.850
with four of these muscular, screaming unicorns,

2060
01:15:50.850 --> 01:15:52.700
that just rush into it, stabbing with its horns,

2061
01:15:52.700 --> 01:15:54.810
and you see it (screeching) pull back a bit,

2062
01:15:54.810 --> 01:15:59.380
its blood everywhere, mixed in with whatever its oil is.

2063
01:15:59.380 --> 01:16:01.300
It's hurt pretty bad.

2064
01:16:01.300 --> 01:16:03.990
LAURA: I rolled 8d8 instead of 5d8.

2065
01:16:03.990 --> 01:16:04.823
MATT: Okay.

2066
01:16:04.823 --> 01:16:08.350
LAURA: So I'll take the 14, which
was the first four numbers,

2067
01:16:08.350 --> 01:16:10.220
then I'm just going to roll the second one again,

2068
01:16:10.220 --> 01:16:11.690
if that's cool.
MATT: Okay, go for it.

2069
01:16:11.690 --> 01:16:14.400
LAURA: Okay, so that's 18 damage.

2070
01:16:14.400 --> 01:16:18.020
MATT: Still hurt, but not as bad as you thought (laughs).

2071
01:16:18.020 --> 01:16:20.370
MARISHA: I just look over my shoulder at Jester.

2072
01:16:21.989 --> 01:16:22.822
Huh.

2073
01:16:22.822 --> 01:16:25.710
MATT: All right, the one that's going towards Caduceus,

2074
01:16:27.440 --> 01:16:31.694
it lands and it gives out a horrifying screech (screeches)

2075
01:16:31.694 --> 01:16:34.330
that echoes out, and all of you feel it piercing your ears.

2076
01:16:34.330 --> 01:16:35.506
I need everybody to make a wisdom-saving throw,

2077
01:16:35.506 --> 01:16:38.006
if you please.
SAM: Oh no, oh nos!

2078
01:16:38.890 --> 01:16:40.180
Oh noes!

2079
01:16:42.600 --> 01:16:45.440
TRAVIS: 23, natural 20.
MATT: Nice.

2080
01:16:45.440 --> 01:16:46.490
MARISHA: 17.
MATT: Nice.

2081
01:16:46.490 --> 01:16:48.270
LIAM: Natural 20.
MATT: Nice!

2082
01:16:48.270 --> 01:16:50.470
SAM: Natural one.
LAURA: Natural one.

2083
01:16:50.470 --> 01:16:51.303
TRAVIS: Whoa!

2084
01:16:51.303 --> 01:16:52.180
MATT: Nott, you are frightened.

2085
01:16:52.180 --> 01:16:54.730
MARISHA: The universe demands balance, man.

2086
01:16:56.560 --> 01:16:59.950
MATT: You are frightened of the one over here, by Caduceus.

2087
01:17:01.820 --> 01:17:03.040
One?

2088
01:17:03.040 --> 01:17:04.240
You are also frightened.

2089
01:17:06.860 --> 01:17:08.310
Caduceus?
TALIESIN: 25.

2090
01:17:08.310 --> 01:17:10.370
ASHLEY: 16.
MATT: 16, all right.

2091
01:17:10.370 --> 01:17:12.570
The rest of you manage to resist the effect.

2092
01:17:13.460 --> 01:17:15.630
Those two immediately become filled with fear,

2093
01:17:15.630 --> 01:17:18.000
as its screech tends to pierce your mind

2094
01:17:18.000 --> 01:17:19.650
and your sense of confidence.

2095
01:17:19.650 --> 01:17:21.180
Knowing it's there and you're being surrounded,

2096
01:17:21.180 --> 01:17:22.980
you can feel the adrenaline pumping in your system

2097
01:17:22.980 --> 01:17:26.400
and the urge to just run. It's that one.

2098
01:17:26.400 --> 01:17:27.466
There are two against you, Fjord,

2099
01:17:27.466 --> 01:17:28.360
that both have you flanked.

2100
01:17:28.360 --> 01:17:29.950
They're going to get advantage on their attacks.

2101
01:17:29.950 --> 01:17:30.783
TRAVIS: Okay.

2102
01:17:30.783 --> 01:17:31.657
MATT: The first one,

2103
01:17:31.657 --> 01:17:35.450
(laughs) okay, that's a 13.

2104
01:17:35.450 --> 01:17:36.283
TRAVIS: That misses.

2105
01:17:36.283 --> 01:17:38.970
MATT: Yeah, even with advantage, it was a one and a seven.

2106
01:17:38.970 --> 01:17:39.803
TRAVIS: Oh (laughs).

2107
01:17:39.803 --> 01:17:41.740
MATT: The other one, on the opposite end,

2108
01:17:41.740 --> 01:17:42.770
that's a little better.

2109
01:17:42.770 --> 01:17:44.660
That'll be a 24 to hit.
TRAVIS: That hits.

2110
01:17:44.660 --> 01:17:47.827
MATT: That one deals--

2111
01:17:48.860 --> 01:17:52.170
oof, that is 10 points of slashing damage to you.

2112
01:17:52.170 --> 01:17:53.610
TRAVIS: Okay.

2113
01:17:53.610 --> 01:17:55.485
MATT: Then the one attacking you, Beauregard,

2114
01:17:55.485 --> 01:17:58.570
has disadvantage on the strike,
because you did Patient Defense.

2115
01:17:58.570 --> 01:18:00.860
That is going to be another 13 to hit.

2116
01:18:00.860 --> 01:18:02.010
MARISHA: Miss.
MATT: Misses (whooshes),

2117
01:18:02.010 --> 01:18:03.680
you duck out of the way on that one.

2118
01:18:03.680 --> 01:18:05.390
MARISHA: Preternatural Counter.

2119
01:18:05.390 --> 01:18:08.120
Preternatural Counter?

2120
01:18:08.120 --> 01:18:10.000
TRAVIS: Preternatur-- preternatural?

2121
01:18:10.000 --> 01:18:11.160
MARISHA: Perter-nurter.

2122
01:18:11.160 --> 01:18:12.920
TALIESIN: Preter, preter neutral.

2123
01:18:12.920 --> 01:18:14.700
MARISHA: Predator.
TRAVIS: Not prenatal.

2124
01:18:14.700 --> 01:18:16.664
MATT: Preternatural Counter.

2125
01:18:16.664 --> 01:18:18.440
MARISHA: Hurda-der-da-da.
MATT: (laughs)

2126
01:18:18.440 --> 01:18:19.680
ASHLEY: Hurda-der-dah-dirty.

2127
01:18:19.680 --> 01:18:20.620
MATT: I think the effect takes place

2128
01:18:20.620 --> 01:18:23.540
after you've marked something or analyzed it.

2129
01:18:23.540 --> 01:18:26.360
LIAM: It means you have to pee on it.

2130
01:18:26.360 --> 01:18:27.590
MARISHA: You might be right.
TRAVIS: Pee on stuff more.

2131
01:18:27.590 --> 01:18:29.640
MATT: But next time you do that, you can totally do that.

2132
01:18:29.640 --> 01:18:31.260
MARISHA: Goddamn it.
MATT: I know.

2133
01:18:31.260 --> 01:18:34.510
Then there's the one attacking you, Yasha.

2134
01:18:34.510 --> 01:18:35.343
Natural one.

2135
01:18:35.343 --> 01:18:38.190
They are rolling terrible.
LAURA: Woo!

2136
01:18:38.190 --> 01:18:39.860
MATT: All right, that's their turn.

2137
01:18:39.860 --> 01:18:40.810
Nott, you're up.

2138
01:18:40.810 --> 01:18:43.063
Caduceus, you're on deck.

2139
01:18:43.063 --> 01:18:43.896
SAM: Because I'm frightened,

2140
01:18:43.896 --> 01:18:45.750
I have disadvantage on attack rolls?

2141
01:18:45.750 --> 01:18:46.950
MATT: Correct, and you cannot move closer.

2142
01:18:46.950 --> 01:18:49.350
LAURA: Against everything, or
just against that one creature?

2143
01:18:49.350 --> 01:18:51.920
MATT: While you're within sight of it or you can see it,

2144
01:18:51.920 --> 01:18:53.170
you have disadvantage on attack rolls.

2145
01:18:53.170 --> 01:18:54.003
LAURA: Okay.

2146
01:18:54.003 --> 01:18:57.740
SAM: So that negates sneak attack?

2147
01:18:57.740 --> 01:18:59.790
MATT: Yes, unless their adjacent to somebody.

2148
01:19:00.870 --> 01:19:01.870
SAM: Okay.

2149
01:19:01.870 --> 01:19:03.230
MATT: And you cannot move closer to that one.

2150
01:19:03.230 --> 01:19:04.700
That is the source of your fear.

2151
01:19:05.840 --> 01:19:08.970
SAM: Then I will yelp

2152
01:19:09.820 --> 01:19:12.770
and run away from it,

2153
01:19:12.770 --> 01:19:15.090
towards the mother harpy.

2154
01:19:15.090 --> 01:19:17.329
MARISHA: Two stars.
MATT: All righty.

2155
01:19:17.329 --> 01:19:18.162
LAURA: (laughs)

2156
01:19:18.162 --> 01:19:18.995
MATT: How much you want to move to?

2157
01:19:18.995 --> 01:19:20.510
One, two, three.

2158
01:19:20.510 --> 01:19:21.800
SAM: Right under the mother harpy.

2159
01:19:21.800 --> 01:19:23.250
MATT: Gotcha, yeah, because you're invisible,

2160
01:19:23.250 --> 01:19:24.310
it doesn't get an attack of opportunity,

2161
01:19:24.310 --> 01:19:25.143
doesn't even know you're there.

2162
01:19:25.143 --> 01:19:30.143
SAM: Okay, I can still attack things, just not that one?

2163
01:19:30.660 --> 01:19:31.493
MATT: Correct.

2164
01:19:31.493 --> 01:19:33.040
SAM: Okay.

2165
01:19:33.040 --> 01:19:35.140
TALIESIN: Technically, Yasha also would've gotten an attack,

2166
01:19:35.140 --> 01:19:36.640
since she was within--
MATT: That's right.

2167
01:19:36.640 --> 01:19:37.950
ASHLEY: Oh, oh, yes.

2168
01:19:37.950 --> 01:19:39.680
MATT: Go ahead and roll your attack on that guy.

2169
01:19:39.680 --> 01:19:40.513
ASHLEY: Okay.

2170
01:19:43.141 --> 01:19:45.724
TRAVIS: ♪ Enjoy raging ♪

2171
01:19:49.360 --> 01:19:51.020
ASHLEY: 15.

2172
01:19:51.020 --> 01:19:52.250
MATT: 15 hits.

2173
01:19:52.250 --> 01:19:56.200
Go ahead and roll damage.
ASHLEY: Yes, okay.

2174
01:19:56.200 --> 01:19:58.283
Let me get all my pieces.

2175
01:20:01.600 --> 01:20:03.900
Ooh, okay, 11, 12, 13.

2176
01:20:05.340 --> 01:20:08.130
23 points of damage.
MATT: 23 points of damage?

2177
01:20:08.130 --> 01:20:09.020
Ooh!

2178
01:20:09.020 --> 01:20:11.410
You take a hearty chunk out of that harpy.

2179
01:20:11.410 --> 01:20:13.000
Just as it swoops down and strikes towards you,

2180
01:20:13.000 --> 01:20:14.640
you duck out of the way and spin around

2181
01:20:14.640 --> 01:20:16.260
with the momentum and just slam your blade

2182
01:20:16.260 --> 01:20:18.230
into the side of it's back. (pained screech)

2183
01:20:18.230 --> 01:20:19.150
It stumbles to the ground

2184
01:20:19.150 --> 01:20:20.450
and limps forward a few steps,

2185
01:20:20.450 --> 01:20:23.420
before (whooshes) it starts getting back up.

2186
01:20:23.420 --> 01:20:25.080
It's hurt.

2187
01:20:25.080 --> 01:20:27.010
Finishing your turn, Nott.

2188
01:20:27.010 --> 01:20:30.400
SAM: I will take out my crossbow and aim it,

2189
01:20:30.400 --> 01:20:35.250
but I find I'm shaking so much I can't get a true aim,

2190
01:20:35.250 --> 01:20:37.060
so I will spend my action

2191
01:20:37.060 --> 01:20:40.100
and bonus action consuming alcohol.

2192
01:20:40.100 --> 01:20:42.000
MATT: (laughs) Okay, fair enough.

2193
01:20:42.840 --> 01:20:45.580
So action and bonus action,

2194
01:20:45.580 --> 01:20:47.930
six seconds of straight chugging,

2195
01:20:47.930 --> 01:20:49.130
that'll make you drunk.

2196
01:20:49.130 --> 01:20:49.963
SAM: Okay.

2197
01:20:49.963 --> 01:20:52.230
MATT: So you shrug off the fear,

2198
01:20:52.230 --> 01:20:53.268
but you're also now drunk.

2199
01:20:53.268 --> 01:20:55.470
(laughs)

2200
01:20:55.470 --> 01:20:56.400
TRAVIS: Is that because you were afraid,

2201
01:20:56.400 --> 01:20:58.650
or it does something to add to your fighting?

2202
01:20:59.800 --> 01:21:00.780
SAM: Huh?

2203
01:21:00.780 --> 01:21:03.334
(laughter)

2204
01:21:03.334 --> 01:21:04.490
MATT: It's a character choice, Travis.

2205
01:21:04.490 --> 01:21:06.200
SAM: I am now immune to fright.

2206
01:21:06.200 --> 01:21:07.060
MATT: All right, Caduceus, you're up.

2207
01:21:07.060 --> 01:21:08.320
Caleb, you're on deck.

2208
01:21:08.320 --> 01:21:10.750
TALIESIN: Just the one thing you can do.

2209
01:21:10.750 --> 01:21:12.080
Are you immune to fear?

2210
01:21:13.052 --> 01:21:14.508
No, okay.

2211
01:21:17.480 --> 01:21:18.390
LAURA: Caduceus, it's your turn.

2212
01:21:18.390 --> 01:21:19.800
TALIESIN: Oh, it's my-- oh, I'm up, okay.

2213
01:21:19.800 --> 01:21:21.190
MATT: Best way to describe these,

2214
01:21:21.190 --> 01:21:23.310
except for the one that Yasha hit, I think most

2215
01:21:23.310 --> 01:21:26.220
of these are technically still partially in the air.

2216
01:21:26.220 --> 01:21:29.940
That's how they're striking from up and adjacent,

2217
01:21:32.220 --> 01:21:33.559
except for that one that Yasha was fighting.

2218
01:21:33.559 --> 01:21:35.323
It's off the ground.

2219
01:21:35.323 --> 01:21:40.323
TALIESIN: Okay, I like what you did, Jester.

2220
01:21:41.560 --> 01:21:44.590
That was cool, so I'm also going

2221
01:21:44.590 --> 01:21:49.580
to cast Spirit Guardians at level four.

2222
01:21:50.710 --> 01:21:52.370
MATT: Damn, all righty.

2223
01:21:52.370 --> 01:21:53.970
People be liking them guardians.

2224
01:21:55.560 --> 01:21:58.325
TRAVIS: People be liking them guardians.

2225
01:21:58.325 --> 01:22:00.031
TALIESIN: That's true.

2226
01:22:00.031 --> 01:22:01.520
LAURA: What do yours look like?

2227
01:22:01.520 --> 01:22:03.980
TALIESIN: Oh, mine are little iridescent beetles

2228
01:22:03.980 --> 01:22:05.890
and little flying insects.

2229
01:22:05.890 --> 01:22:08.260
It's just that look, and little dragonflies.

2230
01:22:08.260 --> 01:22:10.060
SAM: Are they complementary color to Jester's?

2231
01:22:10.060 --> 01:22:10.893
LAURA: Well, yeah.

2232
01:22:10.893 --> 01:22:13.220
TALIESIN: Oh yeah, it's all that nice iridescent

2233
01:22:13.220 --> 01:22:16.390
and oil slick look.
LAURA: Blues and purples and greens and stuff.

2234
01:22:16.390 --> 01:22:17.890
MATT: So they are also swirling around.

2235
01:22:17.890 --> 01:22:20.660
LAURA: I imagine there's at least one red dragonfly, though.

2236
01:22:20.660 --> 01:22:22.010
TALIESIN: Oh, I would hope so.
LAURA: Okay, good.

2237
01:22:22.010 --> 01:22:22.878
TALIESIN: My god.

2238
01:22:22.878 --> 01:22:23.850
MATT: (sighs) Two clerics in the party.

2239
01:22:23.850 --> 01:22:25.585
Now I need two 15-foot ones.

2240
01:22:25.585 --> 01:22:27.719
(laughter)

2241
01:22:27.719 --> 01:22:31.052
MATT: Let's see if I got something here.

2242
01:22:32.857 --> 01:22:36.100
SAM and LAURA: (singing along to background music)

2243
01:22:36.100 --> 01:22:39.310
MATT: Here, since you said iridescent--

2244
01:22:39.310 --> 01:22:40.390
TALIESIN: Oh yeah!

2245
01:22:40.390 --> 01:22:43.010
MATT: I'll go ahead and use this rainbow circle

2246
01:22:43.010 --> 01:22:43.895
to mark that one.

2247
01:22:43.895 --> 01:22:45.408
(cheering)

2248
01:22:45.408 --> 01:22:46.241
MATT: There we go.

2249
01:22:46.241 --> 01:22:47.634
TALIESIN: Everything I've ever wanted.
LAURA: That's perfect!

2250
01:22:47.634 --> 01:22:49.160
MATT: There you go.

2251
01:22:49.160 --> 01:22:50.720
TALIESIN: All right.
LAURA: Oh good.

2252
01:22:50.720 --> 01:22:54.870
TALIESIN: So I'm going to I guess use my bonus action

2253
01:22:54.870 --> 01:22:57.200
to tell all the horses to stay in the circle.

2254
01:22:57.200 --> 01:22:59.982
All of you stay in the circle; it should be okay.

2255
01:22:59.982 --> 01:23:01.420
MATT: All the horses head look (snorts).

2256
01:23:01.420 --> 01:23:04.400
look back at you, acknowledging.
TALIESIN: We're working on it.

2257
01:23:04.400 --> 01:23:05.550
TALIESIN: Yeah, since that's my action

2258
01:23:05.550 --> 01:23:07.720
and my bonus action,

2259
01:23:07.720 --> 01:23:09.210
yeah, I don't want to step out

2260
01:23:09.210 --> 01:23:11.350
with that one that's next to me, so.

2261
01:23:11.350 --> 01:23:12.183
MATT: Okay.

2262
01:23:12.183 --> 01:23:13.670
TALIESIN: Yeah, I've got good coverage right now, so.

2263
01:23:13.670 --> 01:23:14.503
MATT: You got it.

2264
01:23:14.503 --> 01:23:15.830
All right, finishing Caduceus' turn--

2265
01:23:15.830 --> 01:23:17.760
TALIESIN: The two that are in there
take damage immediately, right?

2266
01:23:17.760 --> 01:23:18.780
MATT: Does it say they take it immediately

2267
01:23:18.780 --> 01:23:20.550
LAURA: They take it on the top of their turn,

2268
01:23:20.550 --> 01:23:22.730
when they enter the circle.

2269
01:23:22.730 --> 01:23:23.940
TALIESIN: Affected creature speed is halved

2270
01:23:23.940 --> 01:23:24.960
in this area, by the way.

2271
01:23:24.960 --> 01:23:25.793
MATT: Correct.

2272
01:23:27.574 --> 01:23:29.470
TALIESIN: Yeah, enters the first time
or starts its turn there.

2273
01:23:29.470 --> 01:23:31.530
MATT: Right, so next time, in their turn, they'll take it.

2274
01:23:31.530 --> 01:23:33.230
All right, Caleb, you're up.

2275
01:23:33.230 --> 01:23:36.000
LIAM: Caleb is rummaging through his pockets as he backs up,

2276
01:23:36.000 --> 01:23:39.990
away from the main harpy, into the horses,

2277
01:23:39.990 --> 01:23:42.770
bumps into Jester and says: Oh, are you okay?

2278
01:23:42.770 --> 01:23:43.920
LAURA: Mm-hmm!
LIAM: Instantly turns around

2279
01:23:43.920 --> 01:23:45.770
and slaps bat shit and sulfur together

2280
01:23:45.770 --> 01:23:47.900
and a Fireball flies up, out of the air,

2281
01:23:47.900 --> 01:23:51.440
and explodes up and behind the main harpy there,

2282
01:23:51.440 --> 01:23:52.991
level four.
MATT: Right there?

2283
01:23:52.991 --> 01:23:54.410
All right.
LAURA: Whoa.

2284
01:23:54.410 --> 01:23:56.236
MATT: (explosion)
LAURA: Yeah!

2285
01:23:56.236 --> 01:23:57.490
MATT: It explodes.
LAURA: He used the thingy.

2286
01:23:57.490 --> 01:24:01.599
MATT: The entire vicinity of this open glade

2287
01:24:01.599 --> 01:24:05.260
brightly lights up as fire bursts in the air,

2288
01:24:05.260 --> 01:24:09.350
engulfing this harpy matron you see (whooshes) now fall

2289
01:24:09.350 --> 01:24:11.520
about 10 feet before having to catch herself back up

2290
01:24:11.520 --> 01:24:13.660
in the space she was.

2291
01:24:13.660 --> 01:24:15.690
That is going to be, ooh, that's a bad roll.

2292
01:24:16.847 --> 01:24:20.470
(groans) That is a nine on the dex save.

2293
01:24:20.470 --> 01:24:22.200
LIAM: Total of 26.

2294
01:24:22.200 --> 01:24:24.430
MATT: 26 damage, woo!

2295
01:24:24.430 --> 01:24:25.570
Still holding herself in the air,

2296
01:24:25.570 --> 01:24:28.230
a bit burned and charred, smoke come emerging,

2297
01:24:28.230 --> 01:24:30.670
and some of the feathers have curled back,

2298
01:24:30.670 --> 01:24:32.960
edges of them glowing orange, like cinders

2299
01:24:32.960 --> 01:24:34.900
from the Fireball, but still standing there, angrily,

2300
01:24:34.900 --> 01:24:36.630
now staring in your direction.

2301
01:24:36.630 --> 01:24:39.490
LIAM: I will crouch six inches lower, amongst the horses.

2302
01:24:39.490 --> 01:24:40.670
And that'll be my turn.

2303
01:24:40.670 --> 01:24:41.850
MATT: Fair enough.

2304
01:24:41.850 --> 01:24:44.559
It is now the harpy matron's turn.

2305
01:24:44.559 --> 01:24:47.480
LAURA: Oh no.

2306
01:24:47.480 --> 01:24:48.830
SAM: Ca-caw!
MATT: Angrily,

2307
01:24:48.830 --> 01:24:51.470
it's going to (whooshes) swoop in

2308
01:24:51.470 --> 01:24:55.150
and keep that same height against you.

2309
01:24:57.138 --> 01:24:59.510
We'll say for the purposes of this--

2310
01:24:59.510 --> 01:25:01.020
LAURA: Does that take 5d8?

2311
01:25:01.020 --> 01:25:01.853
MATT: It does.

2312
01:25:03.069 --> 01:25:05.760
It makes its wisdom save as it comes into the range.

2313
01:25:05.760 --> 01:25:10.230
That is going to be 14.

2314
01:25:10.230 --> 01:25:12.480
LAURA: Fails.
MATT: Does not succeed.

2315
01:25:13.500 --> 01:25:15.043
LAURA: Ooh, that's good.
TALIESIN: Mm-hmm!

2316
01:25:15.043 --> 01:25:19.522
LAURA: (counting)

2317
01:25:20.870 --> 01:25:22.160
29.

2318
01:25:22.160 --> 01:25:23.980
MATT: 29.
LAURA: That was a much better roll.

2319
01:25:23.980 --> 01:25:24.950
TALIESIN: Oh yeah.

2320
01:25:24.950 --> 01:25:28.370
MATT: Swoops in and gets assaulted

2321
01:25:28.370 --> 01:25:32.330
by the barrage of super, super, super-buff, tiny unicorns.

2322
01:25:32.330 --> 01:25:33.480
TRAVIS: Yeah!

2323
01:25:33.480 --> 01:25:34.610
MATT: Piercing and screaming past,

2324
01:25:34.610 --> 01:25:36.920
it takes the damage but continues to push through,

2325
01:25:36.920 --> 01:25:39.190
eyes on the prize, towards Mr. Caleb there.

2326
01:25:40.087 --> 01:25:42.060
It's going to make two attacks with its claws.

2327
01:25:42.060 --> 01:25:43.860
First strike.

2328
01:25:43.860 --> 01:25:46.420
It's going to be a 17 to hit.

2329
01:25:46.420 --> 01:25:47.280
LIAM: Shield.

2330
01:25:47.280 --> 01:25:48.320
MATT: Shield, all righty.

2331
01:25:48.320 --> 01:25:49.440
(hums) Shield goes up

2332
01:25:49.440 --> 01:25:51.350
and deflects the first volley of claws.

2333
01:25:51.350 --> 01:25:53.310
The second attack, it's a natural 20.

2334
01:25:53.310 --> 01:25:54.420
LAURA: No!
SAM: Oh!

2335
01:25:54.420 --> 01:25:55.300
TALIESIN: Dispelled!

2336
01:25:55.300 --> 01:25:56.520
SAM: Yes!

2337
01:25:56.520 --> 01:25:58.140
MATT: Because you can do that with your reaction, yup.

2338
01:25:58.140 --> 01:25:58.973
LIAM: Whoa!

2339
01:25:59.870 --> 01:26:02.493
(laughter)

2340
01:26:02.493 --> 01:26:03.560
LAURA: Whoa!

2341
01:26:03.560 --> 01:26:07.600
MATT: So you suffer nine points of slashing damage, Caleb.

2342
01:26:07.600 --> 01:26:08.433
LIAM: Yeah, okay.

2343
01:26:08.433 --> 01:26:10.941
TRAVIS: That should've been so much worse.

2344
01:26:10.941 --> 01:26:13.641
SAM: ♪ Shum, dum, doo-doo-dum ♪

2345
01:26:13.641 --> 01:26:16.250
MATT: You now see all the unicorns swirling and battering,

2346
01:26:16.250 --> 01:26:18.190
and it's right above Caleb,

2347
01:26:18.190 --> 01:26:20.520
taking the hits, but wanting to look intent

2348
01:26:20.520 --> 01:26:23.660
to try and grab and yank out of that space.

2349
01:26:23.660 --> 01:26:24.640
That brings us to Fjord's turn.

2350
01:26:24.640 --> 01:26:26.490
Fjord, what are you doing?

2351
01:26:26.490 --> 01:26:30.910
TRAVIS: I am going to cast Armor of Agathys on myself.

2352
01:26:30.910 --> 01:26:31.990
MATT: Okay, there you go.

2353
01:26:33.098 --> 01:26:35.190
:ooking around, the harpies to each side of you,

2354
01:26:35.190 --> 01:26:36.560
scraping and clawing at you,

2355
01:26:36.560 --> 01:26:38.510
and you're trying to shrug them off

2356
01:26:38.510 --> 01:26:39.660
and use the blade to deflect it.

2357
01:26:39.660 --> 01:26:41.500
You put your hand up, touch the front of your chest

2358
01:26:41.500 --> 01:26:44.708
and watch as this heavy set of jagged, spiked ice,

2359
01:26:44.708 --> 01:26:47.210
(whooshes) encases the front of his torso.

2360
01:26:47.210 --> 01:26:50.520
You can see freezing mist drifting off

2361
01:26:50.520 --> 01:26:53.040
of his upper torso as the spell takes effect.

2362
01:26:53.040 --> 01:26:54.440
TRAVIS: 5th-level.
SAM: Ooh!

2363
01:26:54.440 --> 01:26:57.380
MATT: Yeah, 5th-level, so you have 25 temporary hit points.

2364
01:26:57.380 --> 01:26:59.200
SAM: Oh!
ASHLEY: Dang.

2365
01:26:59.200 --> 01:27:01.570
TRAVIS: Yes, and that is it.

2366
01:27:01.570 --> 01:27:02.820
MATT: All right, finishing your turn.

2367
01:27:02.820 --> 01:27:03.950
Top of the round, Beau, you're up.

2368
01:27:03.950 --> 01:27:04.950
Yasha, you're on deck.

2369
01:27:04.950 --> 01:27:06.240
MARISHA: All right, I'm going to go after the one

2370
01:27:06.240 --> 01:27:07.100
that's right in front of me.

2371
01:27:07.100 --> 01:27:10.540
I'm going to grab it by its beaky face,

2372
01:27:10.540 --> 01:27:11.960
and pop, pop!

2373
01:27:11.960 --> 01:27:12.850
MATT: Go for it.

2374
01:27:12.850 --> 01:27:14.257
Take your strikes!
ASHLEY: Bah-bop!

2375
01:27:14.257 --> 01:27:15.980
MARISHA: Bah-bop!
TALIESIN: Bah-bop!

2376
01:27:15.980 --> 01:27:17.000
LAURA: (laughs)

2377
01:27:17.000 --> 01:27:18.410
MARISHA: Bop one and bop two, ooh!

2378
01:27:19.270 --> 01:27:22.160
Oh, oh my god, those are both 18s, natural 18s,

2379
01:27:22.160 --> 01:27:23.850
so 28 for both of them.

2380
01:27:23.850 --> 01:27:24.800
MATT: Both of them hit.

2381
01:27:27.520 --> 01:27:29.660
LAURA: Bob packs a punch.
ASHLEY: Bob packs a punch.

2382
01:27:29.660 --> 01:27:30.960
MARISHA: Oh, wait, wait, wait

2383
01:27:30.960 --> 01:27:32.720
wait, wait, wait.
LIAM: Ba-Barbara Ann?

2384
01:27:32.720 --> 01:27:33.553
Yeah.

2385
01:27:33.553 --> 01:27:36.556
MARISHA: ♪ Ba ba Bob, ba Barbara Ann ♪

2386
01:27:36.556 --> 01:27:39.190
ASHLEY: ♪ Ba ba ba ♪

2387
01:27:39.190 --> 01:27:42.390
MARISHA: The first one is 12, total.

2388
01:27:42.390 --> 01:27:45.100
The second one is 14, total.

2389
01:27:45.100 --> 01:27:46.698
MATT: So the first two hits.

2390
01:27:46.698 --> 01:27:49.770
(thuds) You see it (screeches) pulls back.

2391
01:27:49.770 --> 01:27:51.440
First, it hits in the torso.

2392
01:27:51.440 --> 01:27:53.400
The second one actually strikes in the jaw, and some

2393
01:27:53.400 --> 01:27:56.730
of the jagged, spiked teeth go flying off in the side.

2394
01:27:56.730 --> 01:27:58.210
It withdraws for a moment,

2395
01:27:58.210 --> 01:28:00.040
and then you see it going back in, angrily,

2396
01:28:00.040 --> 01:28:00.873
about to retort.

2397
01:28:00.873 --> 01:28:02.400
You still have your bonus action.

2398
01:28:02.400 --> 01:28:03.960
MARISHA: This one was getting close,

2399
01:28:03.960 --> 01:28:07.260
after the death unicorns, right?

2400
01:28:07.260 --> 01:28:08.880
MATT: This one didn't quite make it into the death unicorns.

2401
01:28:08.880 --> 01:28:10.700
It was the one against Caduceus did.

2402
01:28:10.700 --> 01:28:12.100
This one is just out of the range

2403
01:28:12.100 --> 01:28:13.680
from where it should be standing.

2404
01:28:13.680 --> 01:28:15.650
MARISHA: Are the death unicorns still going?

2405
01:28:15.650 --> 01:28:16.710
MATT: They're still going.

2406
01:28:16.710 --> 01:28:18.860
MARISHA: Can I grab it by its neck

2407
01:28:18.860 --> 01:28:20.190
and thrust it into the--

2408
01:28:20.190 --> 01:28:22.060
MATT: That would've been your action to attempt that.

2409
01:28:22.060 --> 01:28:24.360
MARISHA: Ah, fuck, titties, ass.

2410
01:28:24.360 --> 01:28:25.610
MATT: Bonus action, you still got, but yeah,

2411
01:28:25.610 --> 01:28:27.298
that would've been a full action to try and do that.

2412
01:28:27.298 --> 01:28:30.260
ALL: ♪ Titties, ass, ass and titties ♪

2413
01:28:30.260 --> 01:28:31.832
MATT: Ah, DJ Assault.

2414
01:28:31.832 --> 01:28:33.050
(laughter)

2415
01:28:33.050 --> 01:28:34.141
MATT: Thinking of you.

2416
01:28:34.141 --> 01:28:36.510
TALIESIN: Cheers.

2417
01:28:36.510 --> 01:28:39.290
MARISHA: Okay, question, if I Extract Aspects

2418
01:28:39.290 --> 01:28:40.301
on one of these harpies--

2419
01:28:40.301 --> 01:28:43.050
LIAM: ♪ Extract that ass ♪
MARISHA: ♪ Extract those aspects ♪

2420
01:28:43.050 --> 01:28:44.057
MATT: Does it affect them all? Yes.

2421
01:28:44.057 --> 01:28:44.890
MARISHA: Does it affect them all?

2422
01:28:44.890 --> 01:28:46.750
And then I can Preternatural Counter

2423
01:28:46.750 --> 01:28:47.620
any of them?

2424
01:28:47.620 --> 01:28:49.740
MATT: Yup, and any future ones you encounter.

2425
01:28:49.740 --> 01:28:50.790
MARISHA: He makes the names.

2426
01:28:50.790 --> 01:28:51.623
TRAVIS: I know.

2427
01:28:51.623 --> 01:28:52.970
TRAVIS: Just say (mumbles).

2428
01:28:54.624 --> 01:28:55.457
SAM: (slurring) Preternatural Counter.

2429
01:28:55.457 --> 01:28:56.997
TRAVIS: I feel like you need to
apologize to a few countries.

2430
01:28:56.997 --> 01:28:59.497
(laughter)

2431
01:29:00.667 --> 01:29:01.791
MARISHA: Looking at him--

2432
01:29:01.791 --> 01:29:03.310
LIAM: What does pasteurization have to do with this?

2433
01:29:03.310 --> 01:29:04.930
MARISHA: Flurry of Beaus!
LAURA: (laughs)

2434
01:29:04.930 --> 01:29:05.870
MATT: Go for it.

2435
01:29:05.870 --> 01:29:06.990
Flurry of Beaus.

2436
01:29:06.990 --> 01:29:07.960
(laughs)

2437
01:29:07.960 --> 01:29:08.793
That never gets old.

2438
01:29:08.793 --> 01:29:10.500
MARISHA: That one's cocked.

2439
01:29:11.500 --> 01:29:13.190
Oh, both were bad.

2440
01:29:13.190 --> 01:29:14.960
16 and 13.

2441
01:29:14.960 --> 01:29:16.693
MATT: 16, both hit.

2442
01:29:16.693 --> 01:29:17.526
MARISHA: Really?

2443
01:29:17.526 --> 01:29:18.800
ALL: Ooh!

2444
01:29:18.800 --> 01:29:20.140
MATT: Not a super high AC

2445
01:29:20.140 --> 01:29:21.460
on these basic--

2446
01:29:21.460 --> 01:29:24.290
these general gorefeather harpies, not a high AC.

2447
01:29:24.290 --> 01:29:25.370
TRAVIS: These basic bishes?

2448
01:29:25.370 --> 01:29:27.330
MATT: Yes, if you will, if you will.

2449
01:29:27.330 --> 01:29:28.910
MARISHA: 12 for the first one, nope.

2450
01:29:28.910 --> 01:29:30.770
TALIESIN: I'm glad that we both went to Spiritual Guardians.

2451
01:29:30.770 --> 01:29:31.730
LAURA: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
MARISHA: No, sorry,

2452
01:29:31.730 --> 01:29:32.900
10 for the first one.

2453
01:29:32.900 --> 01:29:37.060
MATT: All righty.
MARISHA: And 13,

2454
01:29:39.230 --> 01:29:41.950
five, six, yeah, 13 for the second one.

2455
01:29:41.950 --> 01:29:42.890
MATT: Okay, so.

2456
01:29:43.770 --> 01:29:46.150
MARISHA: Extract those aspects.

2457
01:29:46.150 --> 01:29:48.630
MATT: So after the two first hits, you pull back

2458
01:29:48.630 --> 01:29:50.490
as one of its claws goes by your face.

2459
01:29:50.490 --> 01:29:53.190
You grab the back of its leg, and with your fist,

2460
01:29:53.190 --> 01:29:56.380
slam it into its back and hold on to its spine,

2461
01:29:56.380 --> 01:29:59.170
and you let your ki pass into it

2462
01:29:59.170 --> 01:30:01.000
for a second, and as you do, you immediately

2463
01:30:01.000 --> 01:30:04.530
understand a lot of its physical weaknesses

2464
01:30:04.530 --> 01:30:06.170
and where the interior of it is.

2465
01:30:06.170 --> 01:30:08.548
They are resistant to necrotic damage.

2466
01:30:08.548 --> 01:30:09.730
MARISHA: Okay.

2467
01:30:09.730 --> 01:30:12.210
With that, you pull your hand back and also realize,

2468
01:30:12.210 --> 01:30:14.620
oh man, that spine's pretty brittle.

2469
01:30:14.620 --> 01:30:16.350
You punch a second time in there,

2470
01:30:16.350 --> 01:30:18.110
and then (cracks) you feel it snap

2471
01:30:18.110 --> 01:30:20.730
and it (groans) just goes limp in your grasp

2472
01:30:20.730 --> 01:30:22.260
and falls to the ground.
As I'm holding

2473
01:30:22.260 --> 01:30:24.800
the dead turkey, can I turn to the group and say,

2474
01:30:24.800 --> 01:30:26.570
don't use death magic!

2475
01:30:26.570 --> 01:30:27.403
You got it.

2476
01:30:27.403 --> 01:30:29.751
Put the pencil down.
Well, that's fun.

2477
01:30:29.751 --> 01:30:31.355
Put the pencil down.

2478
01:30:31.355 --> 01:30:33.520
MATT: (laughs)

2479
01:30:33.520 --> 01:30:34.930
Does that finish your turn, Beau?

2480
01:30:34.930 --> 01:30:35.880
Yeah.
Yasha, you're up.

2481
01:30:35.880 --> 01:30:36.870
Jester, you're on deck.
All right,

2482
01:30:36.870 --> 01:30:39.910
I'm going to keep attacking the one that's right next to me.

2483
01:30:39.910 --> 01:30:40.743
Mm-hmm.

2484
01:30:41.940 --> 01:30:44.060
Fuck it up!
That's cocked.

2485
01:30:44.060 --> 01:30:47.217
Ooh, okay, uh, uh, uh, uh, 22.

2486
01:30:49.480 --> 01:30:51.100
22 hits.
Okay.

2487
01:30:51.100 --> 01:30:52.376
Get it!

2488
01:30:52.376 --> 01:30:54.170
♪ Buh, duh, dun, duh-duh-duh, dun, dun ♪

2489
01:30:54.170 --> 01:30:55.470
The first hit--
Nice.

2490
01:30:57.620 --> 01:31:00.580
22 for the first attack.

2491
01:31:00.580 --> 01:31:02.580
22 points of damage, all righty.

2492
01:31:02.580 --> 01:31:04.208
Second attack,

2493
01:31:06.644 --> 01:31:08.240
oh, that might not hit.

2494
01:31:08.240 --> 01:31:09.920
Oh no, 14.
14 hits.

2495
01:31:09.920 --> 01:31:11.720
Yay!
Roll damage a second time.

2496
01:31:13.935 --> 01:31:14.768
Okay.

2497
01:31:15.659 --> 01:31:19.847
Five, you know what, I'm going to try this other thing

2498
01:31:21.220 --> 01:31:22.053
that I have.

2499
01:31:22.053 --> 01:31:22.886
Where did it go?

2500
01:31:24.670 --> 01:31:27.540
Savage Attacker, where you can--

2501
01:31:27.540 --> 01:31:28.373
Re-roll the damage die?

2502
01:31:28.373 --> 01:31:29.920
Once per turn, where you can re-roll the damage,

2503
01:31:29.920 --> 01:31:32.080
but you can use either total.

2504
01:31:32.080 --> 01:31:32.913
Correct.

2505
01:31:32.913 --> 01:31:34.570
So let me see if I can roll better than that.

2506
01:31:34.570 --> 01:31:36.997
Yes, that was much better.
TALIESIN: (snickers)

2507
01:31:36.997 --> 01:31:38.793
TRAVIS: (laughs)

2508
01:31:38.793 --> 01:31:39.626
12.
It certainly

2509
01:31:39.626 --> 01:31:40.459
couldn't be worse,

2510
01:31:40.459 --> 01:31:41.620
certainly couldn't be better.
20 total!

2511
01:31:41.620 --> 01:31:44.260
20 total, all right, so after it struck down

2512
01:31:44.260 --> 01:31:45.780
towards you, and you dodged it

2513
01:31:45.780 --> 01:31:47.300
and then sliced it once, last round,

2514
01:31:47.300 --> 01:31:48.133
and it fell to the ground,

2515
01:31:48.133 --> 01:31:50.270
it begins (whooshes) getting itself back up.

2516
01:31:50.270 --> 01:31:52.340
As that happens, you take the blade, spin it around

2517
01:31:52.340 --> 01:31:53.858
and jam it into its abdomen.

2518
01:31:53.858 --> 01:31:56.050
(gags) It's still there, holding it.

2519
01:31:56.050 --> 01:31:58.480
Both of its wings folding on it from the impact.

2520
01:31:58.480 --> 01:32:01.280
You take your foot, press down on its own foot

2521
01:32:01.280 --> 01:32:03.800
on the ground, and then (whooshes) arc the blade up

2522
01:32:03.800 --> 01:32:05.140
and (whooshes) carve it right in half,

2523
01:32:05.140 --> 01:32:07.660
from the belly up, and it splays down the middle

2524
01:32:07.660 --> 01:32:09.280
and flops onto the ground.

2525
01:32:09.280 --> 01:32:10.330
I need lessons.

2526
01:32:10.330 --> 01:32:12.130
Give me lessons.
Two down!

2527
01:32:12.130 --> 01:32:13.470
Did you say tuna?

2528
01:32:13.470 --> 01:32:14.303
Two down!
Two down!

2529
01:32:14.303 --> 01:32:15.525
Oh!
(class laughs)

2530
01:32:15.525 --> 01:32:16.800
TRAVIS and ASHLEY: Tuna!

2531
01:32:16.800 --> 01:32:18.228
Tuna!
What is wrong with us?

2532
01:32:18.228 --> 01:32:19.690
Tuna!
Tuna!

2533
01:32:19.690 --> 01:32:21.000
It's a dope battle cry.

2534
01:32:21.000 --> 01:32:22.280
I'm with it.
It's her new battle cry.

2535
01:32:22.280 --> 01:32:23.292
She's taken a lot of hits.

2536
01:32:23.292 --> 01:32:24.125
Tuna!

2537
01:32:24.125 --> 01:32:25.090
Salmon!

2538
01:32:25.090 --> 01:32:26.860
She's still reeling from that pit fight.

2539
01:32:27.910 --> 01:32:29.480
All right, so there are two right there

2540
01:32:29.480 --> 01:32:33.490
that are beginning their turn in the circle of Caduceus',

2541
01:32:34.670 --> 01:32:36.530
one, actually, one that's in both of your guys' radius

2542
01:32:36.530 --> 01:32:39.270
and one that's just in Caduceus'.

2543
01:32:40.432 --> 01:32:41.710
Go ahead and roll your damage, Jester.

2544
01:32:41.710 --> 01:32:44.409
Blowfish!
MARISHA: (laughs)

2545
01:32:44.409 --> 01:32:45.949
Ah!
You got lucky!

2546
01:32:45.949 --> 01:32:47.647
Buh, buh, buh, buh, buh, buh, buh!

2547
01:32:47.647 --> 01:32:49.663
11, 16, 18.

2548
01:32:51.690 --> 01:32:52.523
Ooh!
Ooh!

2549
01:32:54.140 --> 01:32:55.180
26.

2550
01:32:55.180 --> 01:32:57.320
26, it did roll a natural 19.

2551
01:32:57.320 --> 01:32:58.153
Okay, so half that.

2552
01:32:58.153 --> 01:33:00.520
So half that, so it's 13 damage to it.

2553
01:33:00.520 --> 01:33:04.120
Then, Caduceus, how much damage did your roll?

2554
01:33:05.580 --> 01:33:07.560
12, 19, 22.

2555
01:33:08.437 --> 01:33:11.840
22, okay, both of them failed their saves.

2556
01:33:15.010 --> 01:33:17.780
The one that's been assaulting you gets pummeled

2557
01:33:17.780 --> 01:33:19.320
with a bunch of unicorns, stabbing

2558
01:33:19.320 --> 01:33:21.200
at its side and neigh (neighs).

2559
01:33:21.200 --> 01:33:23.960
As they rush into its side, it rears around

2560
01:33:23.960 --> 01:33:26.180
and tries to scrape them away with its claws

2561
01:33:26.180 --> 01:33:31.070
as this swirling mass of beetles (hums) curls over its body

2562
01:33:31.070 --> 01:33:31.903
and begins--

2563
01:33:31.903 --> 01:33:33.330
It's like the '90s Mummy movie, yeah.

2564
01:33:33.330 --> 01:33:36.020
Yeah, it completely obfuscates its torso.

2565
01:33:36.020 --> 01:33:38.180
You hear it screeching within, and as the bugs pull away,

2566
01:33:38.180 --> 01:33:40.250
there's just bones where the torso once was.

2567
01:33:40.250 --> 01:33:41.340
All right.
And it collapses

2568
01:33:41.340 --> 01:33:42.360
to the ground.
Yeah, hey, hey!

2569
01:33:42.360 --> 01:33:44.010
I got way too excited

2570
01:33:44.010 --> 01:33:45.600
about that reference.
Tuna!

2571
01:33:45.600 --> 01:33:46.580
Tuna!
Yeah!

2572
01:33:46.580 --> 01:33:47.710
Yeah, it's the best.

2573
01:33:48.741 --> 01:33:50.780
The two now focusing on you.

2574
01:33:50.780 --> 01:33:51.940
Yeah, the other one took the damage.

2575
01:33:51.940 --> 01:33:53.530
They did, yeah.

2576
01:33:53.530 --> 01:33:54.440
Both with advantage.

2577
01:33:54.440 --> 01:33:55.830
The first one is taking two strikes.

2578
01:33:55.830 --> 01:33:58.030
Ooh, holy shit!

2579
01:33:58.030 --> 01:33:58.920
Two natural 20s.

2580
01:33:58.920 --> 01:34:00.600
Oh!
No joke.

2581
01:34:00.600 --> 01:34:01.580
They get to go before me.

2582
01:34:01.580 --> 01:34:03.050
They do get to go before me?

2583
01:34:04.160 --> 01:34:05.070
Oh, it was your turn.

2584
01:34:05.070 --> 01:34:06.080
That's right, I messed up on that.

2585
01:34:06.080 --> 01:34:07.180
That's okay.
You can keep it.

2586
01:34:07.180 --> 01:34:08.580
You keep those 20s.
Yeah.

2587
01:34:08.580 --> 01:34:09.690
I'm going to keep them,

2588
01:34:09.690 --> 01:34:11.570
depends on if they can, sorry.

2589
01:34:11.570 --> 01:34:14.610
So I wanted to move that direction

2590
01:34:14.610 --> 01:34:17.610
towards the ones attacking Fjord,

2591
01:34:17.610 --> 01:34:20.150
to get them within my 15 feet.

2592
01:34:20.150 --> 01:34:22.860
Okay, okay, I'll allow that.

2593
01:34:22.860 --> 01:34:23.693
Cool, cool, cool.

2594
01:34:23.693 --> 01:34:24.670
And you start your action.

2595
01:34:24.670 --> 01:34:25.870
Am I still frightened?

2596
01:34:27.570 --> 01:34:28.430
That one's dead.

2597
01:34:28.430 --> 01:34:29.930
That one's dead, so you are no longer frightened.

2598
01:34:29.930 --> 01:34:34.160
Oh wait, would it have been after my turn

2599
01:34:34.160 --> 01:34:34.993
that he died?
It would have, yeah.

2600
01:34:34.993 --> 01:34:37.070
So I am still frightened.
So you are still frightened.

2601
01:34:37.070 --> 01:34:38.460
So you have to move adjacent to go there.

2602
01:34:38.460 --> 01:34:39.860
Cool, cool, cool, so I'll go that direction

2603
01:34:39.860 --> 01:34:42.880
and then spell attacks, I would still get disadvantage

2604
01:34:42.880 --> 01:34:44.460
on a spell attack?
Mm-hmm.

2605
01:34:44.460 --> 01:34:45.890
Okay, so instead of doing a spell,

2606
01:34:45.890 --> 01:34:50.890
I'm going to do a sacred flame at the matron.

2607
01:34:51.340 --> 01:34:52.490
Ninth level.
Okay.

2608
01:34:53.410 --> 01:34:56.930
That is a wisdom--

2609
01:34:56.930 --> 01:34:58.000
That's a dexterity save.

2610
01:34:58.000 --> 01:34:59.210
Oh, it's a dexterity.

2611
01:34:59.210 --> 01:35:00.440
Oh, that's a 17.

2612
01:35:00.440 --> 01:35:02.520
17 is what she needed.
Dammit.

2613
01:35:02.520 --> 01:35:05.460
Yeah, so she (whooshes) darts out of the way.

2614
01:35:05.460 --> 01:35:08.040
All right, so now we go to the harpies' turn.

2615
01:35:08.040 --> 01:35:08.873
Yes.

2616
01:35:08.873 --> 01:35:10.860
Your fear is gone now, because it has died.

2617
01:35:12.360 --> 01:35:13.530
Those two that are there,

2618
01:35:13.530 --> 01:35:16.920
both get to roll to see if they get hit by your element.

2619
01:35:16.920 --> 01:35:17.753
Okay.

2620
01:35:20.050 --> 01:35:20.900
That would be--

2621
01:35:21.920 --> 01:35:23.230
Oh wait, I won't roll again.

2622
01:35:23.230 --> 01:35:24.100
17 and a 15.

2623
01:35:26.340 --> 01:35:28.310
The 17 saves.
Okay.

2624
01:35:29.290 --> 01:35:30.490
The 15 fails?

2625
01:35:30.490 --> 01:35:31.323
Yes.
So go ahead

2626
01:35:31.323 --> 01:35:32.250
and roll damage.
And that was what I rolled

2627
01:35:32.250 --> 01:35:33.500
before, I'm assuming.

2628
01:35:33.500 --> 01:35:35.000
Do you want to just use the damage

2629
01:35:35.000 --> 01:35:35.833
that I did the first time.
Oh, that's right.

2630
01:35:35.833 --> 01:35:37.120
We'll keep the 26, right?
That was a 28.

2631
01:35:37.120 --> 01:35:37.953
Oh.

2632
01:35:37.953 --> 01:35:39.360
26.
26, yes.

2633
01:35:40.580 --> 01:35:42.050
We are alive and caffeinated.

2634
01:35:42.050 --> 01:35:44.510
This all makes perfect sense.

2635
01:35:44.510 --> 01:35:45.940
They're both really hurt.

2636
01:35:47.750 --> 01:35:49.920
Then there's the one that attacked you twice.

2637
01:35:52.150 --> 01:35:54.640
Dual critical, they're still on my tray

2638
01:35:54.640 --> 01:35:55.473
if you want to see them.

2639
01:35:55.473 --> 01:35:56.306
I still don't have my reaction back,

2640
01:35:56.306 --> 01:35:57.650
so there's nothing I can do.

2641
01:35:59.560 --> 01:36:01.410
Now you've already taken damage, correct?

2642
01:36:01.410 --> 01:36:02.320
Mm-hmm.

2643
01:36:02.320 --> 01:36:04.860
Okay, so their smell of blood ability kicks in,

2644
01:36:04.860 --> 01:36:07.860
so they do an additional bit of damage for each strike.

2645
01:36:07.860 --> 01:36:12.820
So the first one is going to be (sighs)

2646
01:36:16.720 --> 01:36:19.030
25 points of slashing damage, for the first strike.

2647
01:36:19.030 --> 01:36:22.050
Okay, he takes 25 points of cold damage off

2648
01:36:22.050 --> 01:36:22.883
of that strike.

2649
01:36:22.883 --> 01:36:26.060
As the ice bursts, it entirely freezes the harpy.

2650
01:36:26.060 --> 01:36:28.070
As it strikes you, you go (groaning),

2651
01:36:29.330 --> 01:36:30.830
falls back and (splats).

2652
01:36:30.830 --> 01:36:31.663
Oh!

2653
01:36:31.663 --> 01:36:32.580
Shatters into the ground, T-1000 style.

2654
01:36:32.580 --> 01:36:35.030
All the unicorns around him go, yay!

2655
01:36:35.030 --> 01:36:36.280
(laughs) Me, me, me!

2656
01:36:38.425 --> 01:36:40.190
Actually, it wouldn't gotten its second attack.

2657
01:36:41.100 --> 01:36:44.120
Because it took away the second attack?

2658
01:36:44.120 --> 01:36:46.170
There's two attacks each, for this one.

2659
01:36:47.174 --> 01:36:48.680
Have you seen Happy?

2660
01:36:48.680 --> 01:36:50.790
So the second actually doesn't happen.

2661
01:36:51.906 --> 01:36:52.900
The other one attacks--
The Pharrell Williams

2662
01:36:52.900 --> 01:36:54.154
music video?

2663
01:36:54.154 --> 01:36:54.987
No, the happy unicorn.
18.

2664
01:36:54.987 --> 01:36:57.600
Yeah.

2665
01:36:58.480 --> 01:37:00.390
23 and 19.

2666
01:37:02.400 --> 01:37:03.800
They both hit.

2667
01:37:03.800 --> 01:37:04.962
Okay.

2668
01:37:06.110 --> 01:37:11.110
First one does eight points of slashing damage.

2669
01:37:12.270 --> 01:37:13.260
It takes--

2670
01:37:13.260 --> 01:37:14.573
25 points.

2671
01:37:14.573 --> 01:37:15.670
(laughs) It also does.

2672
01:37:15.670 --> 01:37:16.800
Yes!
Yes!

2673
01:37:16.800 --> 01:37:17.774
Oh snap!
Oh my god,

2674
01:37:17.774 --> 01:37:22.774
it's so cool.
Wow!

2675
01:37:22.970 --> 01:37:25.930
But that is the end of the Armor of Agathys.

2676
01:37:25.930 --> 01:37:26.920
Gotcha.
Yeah.

2677
01:37:26.920 --> 01:37:28.890
Okay, so both of them, as they both strike you,

2678
01:37:28.890 --> 01:37:31.380
at approximately the same time, you feel the impact,

2679
01:37:31.380 --> 01:37:34.400
and as soon as that hits, the spell ricochets back

2680
01:37:34.400 --> 01:37:36.363
as all the ice off your body just sprays,

2681
01:37:36.363 --> 01:37:38.720
(imitates explosion), shooting hundreds of shards

2682
01:37:38.720 --> 01:37:41.660
of icicle-like blades of ice into both of them,

2683
01:37:41.660 --> 01:37:42.670
and they fall to the ground

2684
01:37:42.670 --> 01:37:44.060
and shatter into a million pieces.

2685
01:37:44.060 --> 01:37:45.690
Whoa!
That finishes their go.

2686
01:37:45.690 --> 01:37:46.523
Nott, you're up.

2687
01:37:46.523 --> 01:37:49.040
The only standing one right now is the matron

2688
01:37:49.040 --> 01:37:50.250
that's been harrying.

2689
01:37:50.250 --> 01:37:51.510
And you're invisible.

2690
01:37:51.510 --> 01:37:54.790
I will attack her with my crossbow.

2691
01:37:54.790 --> 01:37:55.623
All righty.

2692
01:37:57.890 --> 01:37:59.190
Not the greatest attack.

2693
01:38:01.060 --> 01:38:01.893
Shit.

2694
01:38:03.000 --> 01:38:04.576
Only a 16.
Hits.

2695
01:38:04.576 --> 01:38:06.020
Oh!

2696
01:38:06.020 --> 01:38:07.700
I assume sneak attack.

2697
01:38:07.700 --> 01:38:08.533
Yes.

2698
01:38:10.738 --> 01:38:12.960
Whoa!
Jeez!

2699
01:38:12.960 --> 01:38:14.050
Rogues.

2700
01:38:14.050 --> 01:38:15.821
Ah, yeah.

2701
01:38:15.821 --> 01:38:17.400
(laughs) Yeah.

2702
01:38:17.400 --> 01:38:22.400
24 plus six is 30, plus I'll do Fury of the Small, 41.

2703
01:38:22.770 --> 01:38:23.603
How do you want to do this?

2704
01:38:23.603 --> 01:38:26.120
ALL: Yeah!

2705
01:38:26.120 --> 01:38:27.020
Ass and titties.

2706
01:38:28.082 --> 01:38:30.870
Ass and titties.
In my drunken state,

2707
01:38:30.870 --> 01:38:35.870
I will stumble, fall down, and it'll accidentally shoot.

2708
01:38:36.300 --> 01:38:37.898
(laughter)

2709
01:38:37.898 --> 01:38:39.000
Yes!

2710
01:38:39.000 --> 01:38:39.833
Perfect!

2711
01:38:40.770 --> 01:38:43.750
As you do so, the invisibility fades,

2712
01:38:43.750 --> 01:38:45.308
right as your mid-fall.

2713
01:38:45.308 --> 01:38:46.340
Oh (groans).

2714
01:38:46.340 --> 01:38:48.390
As you do (twangs), takes off.

2715
01:38:48.390 --> 01:38:50.870
The gorefeather harpy matron, who's currently

2716
01:38:50.870 --> 01:38:53.260
in the process of about to sink its claws

2717
01:38:53.260 --> 01:38:55.630
into the eyes of Caleb, who's rushing

2718
01:38:55.630 --> 01:38:58.400
and looking behind, just as it swoops down (snarls),

2719
01:38:58.400 --> 01:39:01.210
large, heaping claws are ready to just carve

2720
01:39:01.210 --> 01:39:03.490
into its face, here's the oh!

2721
01:39:03.490 --> 01:39:05.440
It glances over the shoulder,

2722
01:39:05.440 --> 01:39:07.501
and from the perspective of the bolt (hisses),

2723
01:39:07.501 --> 01:39:11.400
(groans) and just (whooshes) goes right under the jaw

2724
01:39:11.400 --> 01:39:12.690
and emerges most of the way

2725
01:39:12.690 --> 01:39:13.523
through the other side of the head.

2726
01:39:13.523 --> 01:39:14.356
It's a unicorn!

2727
01:39:14.356 --> 01:39:16.855
This eye gets pushed a little out of the socket,

2728
01:39:16.855 --> 01:39:18.320
from the pressure behind the bolt.

2729
01:39:18.320 --> 01:39:19.181
Mission: Impossible III.

2730
01:39:19.181 --> 01:39:23.620
It (whooshes) and instinctually tries to fly,

2731
01:39:23.620 --> 01:39:25.340
gets about five feet before it arcs

2732
01:39:25.340 --> 01:39:27.520
and (thuds).
Now it's sad.

2733
01:39:27.520 --> 01:39:28.542
Tumbles onto the ground.

2734
01:39:28.542 --> 01:39:30.790
Like an off-balance kite with the string,

2735
01:39:30.790 --> 01:39:32.780
no, no, no!

2736
01:39:32.780 --> 01:39:33.880
LIAM: And stay down!

2737
01:39:33.880 --> 01:39:35.350
(laughter)

2738
01:39:35.350 --> 01:39:36.830
Did I hit it?

2739
01:39:37.710 --> 01:39:38.820
Yay!

2740
01:39:38.820 --> 01:39:40.360
I mean--

2741
01:39:40.360 --> 01:39:42.010
Like a failed video from Texas.

2742
01:39:42.898 --> 01:39:43.731
Oh!

2743
01:39:43.731 --> 01:39:44.710
Humpf, poom, ting!

2744
01:39:44.710 --> 01:39:47.800
That, that, that, that went pretty well, right?

2745
01:39:48.900 --> 01:39:52.160
Yeah, come back, come back, WC, everything's okay.

2746
01:39:53.906 --> 01:39:54.800
I think it's all done.

2747
01:39:54.800 --> 01:39:55.633
We're good.

2748
01:39:55.633 --> 01:39:57.070
Does the horse stop?

2749
01:39:57.070 --> 01:39:58.633
The horse eventually does stop.

2750
01:39:58.633 --> 01:40:00.062
LAURA: (laughs)

2751
01:40:00.062 --> 01:40:02.450 line:15%
It takes a moment--
We got him back!

2752
01:40:02.450 --> 01:40:03.680 line:15%
A moment to find the horse.

2753
01:40:03.680 --> 01:40:06.240 line:15%
But you do manage to retrieve him.

2754
01:40:06.240 --> 01:40:08.290 line:15%
All right, all right.

2755
01:40:08.290 --> 01:40:10.150 line:15%
How many successes did we get before, just two?

2756
01:40:10.150 --> 01:40:10.983 line:15%
No, that was a failure.

2757
01:40:10.983 --> 01:40:12.120 line:15%
Once successful.
That was a failure.

2758
01:40:12.120 --> 01:40:13.200 line:15%
Once successful and a failure.

2759
01:40:13.200 --> 01:40:14.670 line:15%
Oh fuck.

2760
01:40:14.670 --> 01:40:15.503 line:15%
Oh god,

2761
01:40:15.503 --> 01:40:17.620 line:15%
it's a long road ahead.
So your horses regathered

2762
01:40:17.620 --> 01:40:21.850 line:15%
and pushing forward into the next length of this journey,

2763
01:40:21.850 --> 01:40:23.760 line:15%
you're now in the middle of the first valley

2764
01:40:23.760 --> 01:40:25.330 line:15%
and making your way up the next path

2765
01:40:25.330 --> 01:40:28.070 line:15%
in the northwestern direction, over the next mountain range.

2766
01:40:28.070 --> 01:40:30.290 line:15%
Who is helming this next leg of the journey?

2767
01:40:31.167 --> 01:40:32.490 line:15%
I'll do it.

2768
01:40:32.490 --> 01:40:34.360 line:15%
Okay, how would you like to help

2769
01:40:34.360 --> 01:40:37.400 line:15%
and aid the travel, at this portion?

2770
01:40:37.400 --> 01:40:39.550 line:15%
I'm assuming Sleight of Hand

2771
01:40:39.550 --> 01:40:43.220 line:15%
and Medicine don't really help much.

2772
01:40:43.220 --> 01:40:44.710 line:15%
If you can come up with a very creative way,

2773
01:40:44.710 --> 01:40:47.200 line:15%
you can attempt with a very high DC.

2774
01:40:47.200 --> 01:40:49.760 line:15%
Nope, I'm just going to use Perception.

2775
01:40:49.760 --> 01:40:50.800 line:15%
Okay.

2776
01:40:50.800 --> 01:40:51.633 line:15%
Oh, you don't need me.

2777
01:40:51.633 --> 01:40:52.466 line:15%
You can do your own.

2778
01:40:52.466 --> 01:40:53.950 line:15%
No, yeah, I'm going to guide myself,

2779
01:40:53.950 --> 01:40:56.550 line:15%
but does anyone want to help me keep an eye out?

2780
01:40:56.550 --> 01:40:57.600 line:15%
Anyone?

2781
01:40:57.600 --> 01:40:58.700 line:15%
I'll help.
Okay.

2782
01:41:00.330 --> 01:41:01.341 line:15%
All right.
All right.

2783
01:41:01.341 --> 01:41:03.841 line:15%
(laughter)

2784
01:41:04.920 --> 01:41:05.753 line:15%
Gentle giant.

2785
01:41:05.753 --> 01:41:06.940 line:15%
Oh, oh, good, good.
Hey!

2786
01:41:08.275 --> 01:41:09.408 line:15%
Okay.

2787
01:41:09.408 --> 01:41:11.000 line:15%
21.

2788
01:41:11.000 --> 01:41:12.592 line:15%
♪ Ho, ho, ho ♪
♪ Green Giant ♪

2789
01:41:12.592 --> 01:41:13.899 line:15%
Three, right there.
24, thank you.

2790
01:41:13.899 --> 01:41:14.750 line:15%
21 plus four, 25.

2791
01:41:16.571 --> 01:41:18.630 line:15%
25, all right, this is the second success.

2792
01:41:18.630 --> 01:41:19.520 line:15%
Yes!

2793
01:41:19.520 --> 01:41:22.370 line:15%
Aiding yourself up through this portion of the forest,

2794
01:41:22.370 --> 01:41:24.900 line:15%
you eventually, with Jester's guidance,

2795
01:41:24.900 --> 01:41:27.290 line:15%
find your way up to the next mountain crest.

2796
01:41:27.290 --> 01:41:31.670 line:15%
This one getting slowly closer towards Mount Mentiri.

2797
01:41:31.670 --> 01:41:32.503 line:15%
As you hit the edge,

2798
01:41:32.503 --> 01:41:35.380 line:15%
you can see the bright-red mountain a little ways ahead.

2799
01:41:35.380 --> 01:41:37.360 line:15%
This next valley below that you'll have to traverse,

2800
01:41:37.360 --> 01:41:39.610 line:15%
that is the safest route you can take, is much wider

2801
01:41:39.610 --> 01:41:40.710 line:15%
than the one you just went through

2802
01:41:40.710 --> 01:41:43.680 line:15%
and will eventually lead towards the base of Mount Mentiri.

2803
01:41:44.580 --> 01:41:48.230 line:15%
The forest here is spotted from this distance,

2804
01:41:48.230 --> 01:41:49.710 line:15%
you can see, from the daylight.

2805
01:41:49.710 --> 01:41:51.810 line:15%
You're about mid-afternoon, at this point.

2806
01:41:53.150 --> 01:41:56.720 line:15%
You can see there are elements where the canopies break,

2807
01:41:56.720 --> 01:41:59.600 line:15%
and it's hard to see what's below them.

2808
01:42:01.100 --> 01:42:03.350 line:15%
The tree colors and the various elements

2809
01:42:03.350 --> 01:42:06.890 line:15%
of the foliage seems to transition.

2810
01:42:06.890 --> 01:42:09.950 line:15%
You'll also notice that a heavy fog is settled

2811
01:42:09.950 --> 01:42:12.620 line:15%
over elements of the mountains,

2812
01:42:12.620 --> 01:42:14.050 line:15%
the further down you head into it,

2813
01:42:14.050 --> 01:42:15.790 line:15%
and the very, very tops of some of the trees,

2814
01:42:15.790 --> 01:42:20.230 line:15%
at the base of the valley, are mostly obscured by this fog.

2815
01:42:20.230 --> 01:42:22.860 line:15%
You're able to just make out the distant

2816
01:42:22.860 --> 01:42:25.510 line:15%
dark shadows of where the treetops are.

2817
01:42:27.440 --> 01:42:30.360 line:15%
So you continue down, slowly making your way

2818
01:42:30.360 --> 01:42:32.440 line:15%
through the next element of the dense forest.

2819
01:42:32.440 --> 01:42:34.170 line:15%
Who's helming this next leg of the journey?

2820
01:42:34.170 --> 01:42:35.198 line:15%
I'll do it.

2821
01:42:35.198 --> 01:42:36.300 line:15%
Okay.

2822
01:42:36.300 --> 01:42:40.090 line:15%
I will send Frumpkin into the air to fly low,

2823
01:42:41.520 --> 01:42:43.990 line:15%
out a good 1/4 of a mile ahead of us to see

2824
01:42:43.990 --> 01:42:46.400 line:15%
if there is anything dangerous.

2825
01:42:46.400 --> 01:42:48.920 line:15%
Okay, so Frumpkin is utilizing Perception.

2826
01:42:48.920 --> 01:42:49.753 line:15%
Yes, right?
Yeah.

2827
01:42:49.753 --> 01:42:52.970 line:15%
Okay, so as you guys are following Frumpkin's lead,

2828
01:42:52.970 --> 01:42:56.480 line:15%
heading down this trail and path deep into the forest,

2829
01:42:56.480 --> 01:42:57.313 line:15%
go ahead and roll perception for me.

2830
01:42:57.313 --> 01:42:58.350 line:15%
That guy didn't see you

2831
01:42:58.350 --> 01:42:59.710 line:15%
on the Frumpkin roll?
Unfortunately, no.

2832
01:42:59.710 --> 01:43:00.600 line:15%
Okay.

2833
01:43:00.600 --> 01:43:01.980 line:15%
Please be a good roll, for once.

2834
01:43:01.980 --> 01:43:03.426 line:15%
No, that's a two.

2835
01:43:03.426 --> 01:43:05.018 line:15%
It's a three.

2836
01:43:05.018 --> 01:43:06.920 line:15%
Wait, don't you need assistance?

2837
01:43:06.920 --> 01:43:08.140 line:15%
Not with Frumpkin.

2838
01:43:08.140 --> 01:43:10.570 line:15%
Frumpkin's way far away.
Frumpkin is your assistance.

2839
01:43:10.570 --> 01:43:11.403 line:15%
Okay.

2840
01:43:11.403 --> 01:43:13.270 line:15%
You guys continue--
It's foggy.

2841
01:43:13.270 --> 01:43:14.493 line:15%
(class laughs)

2842
01:43:14.493 --> 01:43:16.290 line:15%
It is foggy.

2843
01:43:16.290 --> 01:43:19.740 line:15%
As you head into the next leg of this dense forest,

2844
01:43:19.740 --> 01:43:22.400 line:15%
the fog begins to make it difficult to see more

2845
01:43:22.400 --> 01:43:25.060 line:15%
than 20 or so feet ahead of you, beyond just the shapes

2846
01:43:25.060 --> 01:43:27.500 line:15%
of trees slowly emerging from the mist.

2847
01:43:28.690 --> 01:43:30.380 line:15%
Following Frumpkin's lead

2848
01:43:30.380 --> 01:43:31.740 line:15%
and the communication you guys have

2849
01:43:31.740 --> 01:43:34.330 line:15%
whenever Frumpkin circle back over on your path,

2850
01:43:34.330 --> 01:43:35.780 line:15%
you continue pushing forward.

2851
01:43:36.961 --> 01:43:38.680 line:15%
The smell begins to change,

2852
01:43:38.680 --> 01:43:43.400 line:15%
as that that really strong, earthy dirt-scent

2853
01:43:43.400 --> 01:43:46.280 line:15%
that mingles with that familiar sulfurous smell

2854
01:43:46.280 --> 01:43:50.460 line:15%
that a lot of Kamordah's atmosphere holds,

2855
01:43:50.460 --> 01:43:51.520 line:15%
and it lingers.

2856
01:43:51.520 --> 01:43:53.310 line:15%
It's on your clothes, and you can smell it

2857
01:43:53.310 --> 01:43:54.143 line:15%
since you left the town.

2858
01:43:54.143 --> 01:43:55.850 line:15%
It just sticks to you clothes.

2859
01:43:55.850 --> 01:43:57.760 line:15%
But now it's all around you, once more.

2860
01:43:57.760 --> 01:44:00.500 line:15%
As you're watching Frumpkin fly overhead,

2861
01:44:00.500 --> 01:44:02.680 line:15%
you hear a (popping),

2862
01:44:04.230 --> 01:44:06.240 line:15%
and you look down, and there is

2863
01:44:06.240 --> 01:44:10.989 line:15%
an open spring or a jet of a hot spring,

2864
01:44:10.989 --> 01:44:12.090 line:15%
LAURA: (gasps)
right next to you guys.

2865
01:44:12.090 --> 01:44:17.060 line:15%
That (hisses) sprays a massive geyser

2866
01:44:17.060 --> 01:44:21.830 line:15%
of scalding hot mineral water all over the entirety

2867
01:44:21.830 --> 01:44:22.663 line:15%
of your party.

2868
01:44:22.663 --> 01:44:24.350 line:15%
I need everybody to go ahead

2869
01:44:24.350 --> 01:44:25.929 line:15%
and make a dexterity-saving throw for me, please.

2870
01:44:25.929 --> 01:44:27.290 line:15%
Oh boy!

2871
01:44:27.290 --> 01:44:29.590 line:15%
Caleb was blind and deaf when that happened.

2872
01:44:30.587 --> 01:44:32.560 line:15%
So probably not a good save.

2873
01:44:32.560 --> 01:44:33.393 line:15%
No.

2874
01:44:33.393 --> 01:44:34.670 line:15%
Dexterity.

2875
01:44:34.670 --> 01:44:36.090 line:15%
Oh, I succeeded.
10.

2876
01:44:38.440 --> 01:44:39.500 line:15%
22.

2877
01:44:39.500 --> 01:44:41.860 line:15%
Okay, so for a 10,

2878
01:44:43.340 --> 01:44:45.040 line:15%
the mineral water splashes on you,

2879
01:44:45.990 --> 01:44:47.310 line:15%
and it's not mineral water.

2880
01:44:47.310 --> 01:44:52.310 line:15%
Not only is it hot, it begins to eat away at your skin.

2881
01:44:52.610 --> 01:44:54.790 line:15%
You take 15 points of acid damage.

2882
01:44:55.750 --> 01:45:00.350 line:15%
Beauregard, you take six points of acid damage,

2883
01:45:00.350 --> 01:45:01.719 line:15%
or seven points of acids of damage.

2884
01:45:01.719 --> 01:45:02.880 line:15%
Ouch.

2885
01:45:02.880 --> 01:45:05.880 line:15%
I rolled an eight, but the Ring of Evasion saves my bacon.

2886
01:45:06.890 --> 01:45:07.748 line:15%
Okay, so you're--

2887
01:45:07.748 --> 01:45:10.040 line:15%
Using a slot for it, yeah.

2888
01:45:10.040 --> 01:45:10.940 line:15%
Oh, can I evade?

2889
01:45:12.920 --> 01:45:15.000 line:15%
If I succeed, can I evade?

2890
01:45:15.000 --> 01:45:15.833 line:15%
For half damage?

2891
01:45:15.833 --> 01:45:17.830 line:15%
Remind me of the wording on that.

2892
01:45:17.830 --> 01:45:19.230 line:15%
Success, no damage.

2893
01:45:19.230 --> 01:45:20.860 line:15%
If you fail, it's half damage.

2894
01:45:20.860 --> 01:45:21.693 line:15%
Right.

2895
01:45:21.693 --> 01:45:22.670 line:15%
Am I allowed to evade here?

2896
01:45:25.430 --> 01:45:26.670 line:15%
Yeah, so you would take none.

2897
01:45:26.670 --> 01:45:28.520 line:15%
Okay.
You would.

2898
01:45:28.520 --> 01:45:29.353 line:15%
Awesome.
So, Caleb,

2899
01:45:29.353 --> 01:45:31.220 line:15%
you go ahead and take seven points of acid damage.

2900
01:45:31.220 --> 01:45:32.710 line:15%
Nott, what'd you get?

2901
01:45:32.710 --> 01:45:33.850 line:15%
12.

2902
01:45:33.850 --> 01:45:34.683 line:15%
12?

2903
01:45:34.683 --> 01:45:35.930 line:15%
I will also evade.

2904
01:45:37.470 --> 01:45:39.370 line:15%
But evade, you fail, so you take half damage.

2905
01:45:39.370 --> 01:45:40.380 line:15%
Sure.

2906
01:45:40.380 --> 01:45:42.730 line:15%
So you take seven points of acid damage.

2907
01:45:42.730 --> 01:45:44.360 line:15%
Okay.

2908
01:45:44.360 --> 01:45:45.900 line:15%
I rolled an 18.

2909
01:45:45.900 --> 01:45:48.080 line:15%
18, you take seven points of acid damage.

2910
01:45:48.080 --> 01:45:49.190 line:15%
Eight.

2911
01:45:49.190 --> 01:45:51.260 line:15%
You take 15 points of acid damage.

2912
01:45:51.260 --> 01:45:52.093 line:15%
23.

2913
01:45:52.093 --> 01:45:54.170 line:15%
23, you take seven points of acid damage.

2914
01:45:56.572 --> 01:45:57.800 line:15%
Let me roll for the horses.

2915
01:45:57.800 --> 01:45:58.790 line:15%
Oh!
Oh no, the horses!

2916
01:45:58.790 --> 01:45:59.623 line:15%
No!

2917
01:46:01.006 --> 01:46:01.923 line:15%
Not cool.

2918
01:46:04.255 --> 01:46:05.860 line:15%
Like a western, I need lean over the side

2919
01:46:05.860 --> 01:46:07.665 line:15%
and shield the horse with my body.

2920
01:46:07.665 --> 01:46:11.540 line:15%
MARISHA: (laughs)
LIAM: (hisses)

2921
01:46:11.540 --> 01:46:16.087 line:15%
With the sprays, three of the horses fall.

2922
01:46:16.087 --> 01:46:17.200 line:15%
No!

2923
01:46:17.200 --> 01:46:19.580 line:15%
Claimed by the horrible liquid

2924
01:46:19.580 --> 01:46:21.480 line:15%
that spewed forth from this jet.

2925
01:46:21.480 --> 01:46:22.840 line:15%
Oh shit.
Poor horses!

2926
01:46:22.840 --> 01:46:24.640 line:15%
So you have four horses remaining.

2927
01:46:25.740 --> 01:46:28.450 line:15%
It is getting denser as you travel forward.

2928
01:46:28.450 --> 01:46:31.280 line:15%
We should probably not have the horses anymore.

2929
01:46:31.280 --> 01:46:32.590 line:15%
But I don't want to send them back.

2930
01:46:32.590 --> 01:46:34.600 line:15%
What if there's more harpies?

2931
01:46:34.600 --> 01:46:36.920 line:15%
Caleb, can you do a spell, and we can just send them

2932
01:46:36.920 --> 01:46:41.110 line:15%
to, like, one of the libraries?

2933
01:46:41.110 --> 01:46:43.636 line:15%
Whoa, whoa, that's a big whoa.

2934
01:46:43.636 --> 01:46:45.413 line:15%
(laughter)

2935
01:46:45.413 --> 01:46:48.331 line:15%
SAM: (neighs)

2936
01:46:48.331 --> 01:46:51.250 line:15%
I actually do not have that prepared, no.

2937
01:46:51.250 --> 01:46:52.550 line:15%
Jester, if we just leave them here,

2938
01:46:52.550 --> 01:46:55.540 line:15%
by the time we come back, they'll disappear anyway.

2939
01:46:55.540 --> 01:46:56.820 line:15%
That's awful.

2940
01:46:56.820 --> 01:46:58.350 line:15%
Yes, go, look that way.

2941
01:46:58.350 --> 01:46:59.740 line:15%
I will totally

2942
01:46:59.740 --> 01:47:01.260 line:15%
magic them away.
We can send them

2943
01:47:01.260 --> 01:47:02.380 line:15%
to the farm, to the horse farm.

2944
01:47:02.380 --> 01:47:05.860 line:15%
We can try and leave them somewhere safe and--

2945
01:47:05.860 --> 01:47:08.060 line:15%
No, there's definitely going to be creatures

2946
01:47:08.060 --> 01:47:10.010 line:15%
in this forest that will come eat them.

2947
01:47:11.520 --> 01:47:13.976 line:15%
Listen, maybe this just was a one-way ticket.

2948
01:47:13.976 --> 01:47:16.476 line:15%
(laughter)

2949
01:47:19.600 --> 01:47:24.600 line:15%
We did notice those long embraces before they left.

2950
01:47:24.660 --> 01:47:26.460 line:15%
This will be it.

2951
01:47:27.559 --> 01:47:29.740 line:15%
All right, hey, Caduceus,

2952
01:47:31.188 --> 01:47:32.110 line:15%
can you talk to them--
We'll have to double up.

2953
01:47:32.110 --> 01:47:35.660 line:15%
And tell them to, like, go back safely?

2954
01:47:36.570 --> 01:47:37.403 line:15%
I can.

2955
01:47:38.610 --> 01:47:41.450 line:15%
It's getting harder for them to travel anyway.

2956
01:47:41.450 --> 01:47:43.800 line:15%
Tell them to get back recklessly.

2957
01:47:43.800 --> 01:47:46.600 line:15%
It's going to be rough going from here, kids.

2958
01:47:47.484 --> 01:47:49.150 line:15%
Why don't we pack it in?

2959
01:47:49.150 --> 01:47:50.820 line:15%
Do you all remember the way back?

2960
01:47:51.780 --> 01:47:53.550 line:15%
They all loosely look in the direction

2961
01:47:53.550 --> 01:47:54.900 line:15%
of where you traveled from.

2962
01:47:55.950 --> 01:47:58.520 line:15%
I think, we'll take what's packed,

2963
01:47:58.520 --> 01:48:01.550 line:15%
and we'll let you all head back then,

2964
01:48:01.550 --> 01:48:02.383 line:15%
if that's all right.

2965
01:48:02.383 --> 01:48:04.640 line:15%
They look at each other like, all right.

2966
01:48:07.204 --> 01:48:08.037 line:15%
MATT: (snorts)
We could also

2967
01:48:08.037 --> 01:48:09.200 line:15%
just have them stay here and--

2968
01:48:09.200 --> 01:48:10.730 line:15%
Oh.

2969
01:48:10.730 --> 01:48:13.450 line:15%
Caleb waves his hands in the air for a moment

2970
01:48:13.450 --> 01:48:16.220 line:15%
and suddenly all the horses look like moorbounders.

2971
01:48:16.220 --> 01:48:19.120 line:15%
Ooh!
Ooh!

2972
01:48:19.120 --> 01:48:20.580 line:15%
They look like moorbounders?

2973
01:48:20.580 --> 01:48:21.413 line:15%
Yeah.
Yeah.

2974
01:48:21.413 --> 01:48:23.010 line:15%
That's cool.
Oh.

2975
01:48:23.010 --> 01:48:24.640 line:15%
Less likely to be attacked.

2976
01:48:24.640 --> 01:48:25.570 line:15%
Just go, all right!

2977
01:48:25.570 --> 01:48:27.850 line:15%
But they walk really funny.
We didn't like you anyway!

2978
01:48:27.850 --> 01:48:29.414 line:15%
Just go!

2979
01:48:29.414 --> 01:48:32.740 line:15%
(laughs) Moorbounders, walking all prancy.

2980
01:48:33.980 --> 01:48:36.220 line:15%
Please, please, I know what you're rolling.

2981
01:48:36.220 --> 01:48:38.120 line:15%
One of the horses looks extremely spooked

2982
01:48:38.120 --> 01:48:40.280 line:15%
by suddenly being surrounded by other moorbounders.

2983
01:48:40.280 --> 01:48:41.113 line:15%
Oh god!

2984
01:48:41.113 --> 01:48:42.990 line:15%
But the other ones acknowledge

2985
01:48:42.990 --> 01:48:45.410 line:15%
that this was an illusory shift,

2986
01:48:45.410 --> 01:48:46.640 line:15%
but that one is still (gasps).

2987
01:48:46.640 --> 01:48:48.750 line:15%
No, this is, it's not real, it's not real.

2988
01:48:48.750 --> 01:48:49.750 line:15%
It's just a thing.
You have to look

2989
01:48:49.750 --> 01:48:50.710 line:15%
at yourself, look at yourself!
You're fine.

2990
01:48:50.710 --> 01:48:52.802 line:15%
Make an animal handling check.

2991
01:48:52.802 --> 01:48:54.083 line:15%
Falls into a pool of acid.

2992
01:48:54.083 --> 01:48:55.190 line:15%
And he's dead.
LAURA: (laughs)

2993
01:48:55.190 --> 01:48:56.677 line:15%
Oh thank god, 10.
10?

2994
01:48:56.677 --> 01:48:58.490 line:15%
10.
You just manage

2995
01:48:58.490 --> 01:49:00.820 line:15%
to slowly calm it down.

2996
01:49:00.820 --> 01:49:02.460 line:15%
This is just to keep other things away.

2997
01:49:02.460 --> 01:49:04.710 line:15%
It's all just to keep you safe.

2998
01:49:04.710 --> 01:49:07.930 line:15%
You manage to calm it, and the four of them,

2999
01:49:07.930 --> 01:49:10.400 line:15%
with their new illusory presence, begin

3000
01:49:10.400 --> 01:49:12.090 line:15%
to make their way back in the direction

3001
01:49:12.090 --> 01:49:14.180 line:15%
from where you guys came.
Eight hours.

3002
01:49:14.180 --> 01:49:15.030 line:15%
Nice job, you guys.

3003
01:49:15.030 --> 01:49:17.800 line:15%
Critical Role does not have the ASPCA logo.

3004
01:49:18.780 --> 01:49:20.580 line:15%
No, no.

3005
01:49:20.580 --> 01:49:22.820 line:15%
You guys have been responsible, over the years,

3006
01:49:22.820 --> 01:49:24.420 line:15%
for many a mountain death.

3007
01:49:24.420 --> 01:49:25.850 line:15%
That will be the final boss,

3008
01:49:25.850 --> 01:49:29.670 line:15%
will just be the reanimated corpse of every pet

3009
01:49:29.670 --> 01:49:31.586 line:15%
and workhorse.
Sprinkle.

3010
01:49:31.586 --> 01:49:33.758 line:15%
Oh, Sprinkle's the leader.

3011
01:49:33.758 --> 01:49:34.900 line:15%
TALIESIN: (grunts)

3012
01:49:34.900 --> 01:49:36.322 line:15%
So much acid.

3013
01:49:36.322 --> 01:49:38.284 line:15%
(laughter)

3014
01:49:38.284 --> 01:49:39.352 line:15%
The Whispered Weasel.

3015
01:49:39.352 --> 01:49:42.090 line:15%
(laughter)

3016
01:49:42.090 --> 01:49:42.923 line:15%
TALIESIN: (hisses)

3017
01:49:42.923 --> 01:49:44.319 line:15%
He's a constellation now, yeah.

3018
01:49:44.319 --> 01:49:46.640 line:15%
LAURA: (laughs)

3019
01:49:46.640 --> 01:49:49.620 line:15%
All righty, so horseless, you guys begin

3020
01:49:49.620 --> 01:49:52.920 line:15%
to press on further into the next leg of your journey.

3021
01:49:52.920 --> 01:49:56.390 line:15%
As the hard ground of this element at the swamp begins

3022
01:49:56.390 --> 01:49:59.330 line:15%
to slowly soften, and with footfalls around you,

3023
01:49:59.330 --> 01:50:01.520 line:15%
you begin to hear this familiar slush

3024
01:50:01.520 --> 01:50:03.837 line:15%
of wet mud beneath your feet.

3025
01:50:03.837 --> 01:50:06.050 line:15%
MATT: (slurping)

3026
01:50:06.050 --> 01:50:08.750 line:15%
This slight sucking sensation of having to pull your boots

3027
01:50:08.750 --> 01:50:10.810 line:15%
from the muck, you're beginning to helm

3028
01:50:10.810 --> 01:50:14.010 line:15%
into mild marshland.

3029
01:50:15.140 --> 01:50:16.710 line:15%
Who's helming this next leg of the journey?

3030
01:50:16.710 --> 01:50:17.543 line:15%
Oh god.

3031
01:50:17.543 --> 01:50:18.740 line:15%
Yasha.
Yeah.

3032
01:50:18.740 --> 01:50:20.530 line:15%
You're use to marsh.

3033
01:50:20.530 --> 01:50:21.380 line:15%
I'm used to it.

3034
01:50:22.434 --> 01:50:24.010 line:15%
I'm used to this terrain.

3035
01:50:24.010 --> 01:50:25.680 line:15%
I'll take the lead.

3036
01:50:25.680 --> 01:50:27.220 line:15%
Okay.

3037
01:50:27.220 --> 01:50:30.080 line:15%
What skill would you like to present for this one?

3038
01:50:30.080 --> 01:50:31.754 line:15%
Performance!

3039
01:50:31.754 --> 01:50:34.800 line:15%
(laughter)

3040
01:50:34.800 --> 01:50:36.693 line:15%
A little soft-shoe.

3041
01:50:36.693 --> 01:50:37.781 line:15%
♪ Dah, dah, dah, dah-dah ♪

3042
01:50:37.781 --> 01:50:38.614 line:15%
♪ Rah, dah, dah-dah ♪

3043
01:50:38.614 --> 01:50:40.200 line:15%
Real soft-shoe the swamp (slurps).

3044
01:50:41.295 --> 01:50:44.080 line:15%
♪ I'm singing in the swamp ♪

3045
01:50:44.080 --> 01:50:45.600 line:15%
Let's do,

3046
01:50:47.060 --> 01:50:49.240 line:15%
can I do athletics,

3047
01:50:49.240 --> 01:50:54.210 line:15%
because I'm moving through it, just so smoothly?

3048
01:50:54.210 --> 01:50:56.870 line:15%
Because you guys are on foot, you can attempt

3049
01:50:56.870 --> 01:51:00.430 line:15%
to use your athletics to help find routes

3050
01:51:00.430 --> 01:51:02.550 line:15%
outside of the swamp and through boughs and trees,

3051
01:51:02.550 --> 01:51:04.500 line:15%
leaping from branch and finding this out.

3052
01:51:04.500 --> 01:51:08.510 line:15%
It's going to be a high DC, but it's possible.

3053
01:51:08.510 --> 01:51:09.343 line:15%
Okay.

3054
01:51:09.343 --> 01:51:10.520 line:15%
Oh, I'm going to give you Guidance.

3055
01:51:10.520 --> 01:51:12.080 line:15%
Okay.

3056
01:51:12.080 --> 01:51:12.980 line:15%
Oh, that's cocked.

3057
01:51:14.450 --> 01:51:15.283 line:15%
Oh boy.

3058
01:51:16.370 --> 01:51:18.780 line:15%
Oh, okay, good, a natural 20.

3059
01:51:18.780 --> 01:51:19.613 line:15%
Oh!

3060
01:51:19.613 --> 01:51:21.160 line:15%
I rolled a one and a natural 20.

3061
01:51:22.300 --> 01:51:24.520 line:15%
So that would be 28.

3062
01:51:24.520 --> 01:51:26.320 line:15%
Well, Guidance is not advantage.

3063
01:51:26.320 --> 01:51:27.700 line:15%
Ah, never mind.

3064
01:51:27.700 --> 01:51:28.949 line:15%
So you rolled a natural one.
So I rolled a one.

3065
01:51:28.949 --> 01:51:30.960 line:15%
(laughter)

3066
01:51:30.960 --> 01:51:32.140 line:15%
Guidance, adds a d4.

3067
01:51:33.490 --> 01:51:34.339 line:15%
Okay.

3068
01:51:34.339 --> 01:51:35.260 line:15%
(laughter)

3069
01:51:35.260 --> 01:51:37.140 line:15%
Then add your athletic skill.

3070
01:51:38.860 --> 01:51:40.510 line:15%
And that's a 26.

3071
01:51:40.510 --> 01:51:41.600 line:15%
And we go.

3072
01:51:41.600 --> 01:51:44.250 line:15%
Mercer giveth and Mercer taketh away.

3073
01:51:44.250 --> 01:51:45.410 line:15%
Can I borrow a d4?

3074
01:51:45.410 --> 01:51:46.743 line:15%
I'm sorry.

3075
01:51:46.743 --> 01:51:47.848 line:15%
Yasha doesn't use--
Cool.

3076
01:51:47.848 --> 01:51:49.710 line:15%
LAURA: (laughs)
Okay, that's a one.

3077
01:51:50.690 --> 01:51:51.523 line:15%
Oh, cool.

3078
01:51:53.070 --> 01:51:54.130 line:15%
Okay, 10.

3079
01:51:54.130 --> 01:51:54.963 line:15%
10, okay.

3080
01:51:56.407 --> 01:51:57.610 line:15%
LIAM: (splats)

3081
01:51:57.610 --> 01:51:58.990 line:15%
Yasha, you're used to--

3082
01:51:58.990 --> 01:52:01.920 line:15%
Sorry, I thought you said, sorry, my bad, sorry.

3083
01:52:01.920 --> 01:52:02.753 line:15%
It's all good.

3084
01:52:02.753 --> 01:52:04.690 line:15%
You're used to the swamplands of Xhorhas,

3085
01:52:04.690 --> 01:52:08.900 line:15%
where you've traveled through and grew near the Sorrowseep

3086
01:52:08.900 --> 01:52:12.320 line:15%
and the Moorlands, where you spent a lot of your life.

3087
01:52:12.320 --> 01:52:14.770 line:15%
These are different kind of swamp,

3088
01:52:14.770 --> 01:52:17.290 line:15%
and the trees are not as strong

3089
01:52:17.290 --> 01:52:18.123 line:15%
as you would have thought.

3090
01:52:18.123 --> 01:52:19.180 line:15%
Some of them appear to be petrified,

3091
01:52:19.180 --> 01:52:20.440 line:15%
and some have died a long time ago.

3092
01:52:20.440 --> 01:52:22.740 line:15%
As you begin to leap from branch

3093
01:52:22.740 --> 01:52:24.820 line:15%
to finding the right trees in the various places

3094
01:52:24.820 --> 01:52:28.200 line:15%
where the ground is higher than the heavy water

3095
01:52:28.200 --> 01:52:30.950 line:15%
that tends to sit in a lot of the spaces,

3096
01:52:30.950 --> 01:52:33.260 line:15%
a lot of them are soft and bend or break,

3097
01:52:33.260 --> 01:52:36.047 line:15%
and that's a fail.

3098
01:52:38.057 --> 01:52:38.890 line:15%
God.

3099
01:52:40.300 --> 01:52:43.000 line:15%
Nothing terrible happens, but the physical action

3100
01:52:43.000 --> 01:52:46.390 line:15%
of you guys following this path, the heavy mist

3101
01:52:46.390 --> 01:52:49.940 line:15%
that's around you and the just physical exertion

3102
01:52:49.940 --> 01:52:52.520 line:15%
that has come to all of you, I need you all

3103
01:52:52.520 --> 01:52:55.072 line:15%
to make constitution-saving throws for me, please.

3104
01:52:55.072 --> 01:52:58.210 line:15%
Oh boy.
LIAM: (humming)

3105
01:53:00.496 --> 01:53:01.329 line:15%
What the fuck?

3106
01:53:01.329 --> 01:53:02.414 line:15%
Natural one.
Ah!

3107
01:53:02.414 --> 01:53:04.200 line:15%
Oh my god.
Natural one.

3108
01:53:04.200 --> 01:53:06.260 line:15%
You take a point of exhaustion.

3109
01:53:06.260 --> 01:53:08.390 line:15%
11.
Point of exhaustion.

3110
01:53:08.390 --> 01:53:09.774 line:15%
Caleb?

3111
01:53:09.774 --> 01:53:10.607 line:15%
*Un momento**.

3112
01:53:13.510 --> 01:53:14.820 line:15%
15.

3113
01:53:14.820 --> 01:53:17.110 line:15%
15, you manage to pull through.

3114
01:53:18.340 --> 01:53:19.290 line:15%
13.

3115
01:53:19.290 --> 01:53:20.950 line:15%
13, you have a point of exhaustion.

3116
01:53:20.950 --> 01:53:25.950 line:15%
So is that two points of exhaustion?

3117
01:53:25.950 --> 01:53:29.050 line:15%
I'm drunk as well, which you sort

3118
01:53:29.050 --> 01:53:32.710 line:15%
of said is like disadvantage on ability checks.

3119
01:53:32.710 --> 01:53:34.670 line:15%
Correct, it's not two points of exhaustion.

3120
01:53:34.670 --> 01:53:36.010 line:15%
It's just double--

3121
01:53:36.010 --> 01:53:37.600 line:15%
Double disadvantage?

3122
01:53:37.600 --> 01:53:38.490 line:15%
You just have disadvantage.

3123
01:53:38.490 --> 01:53:41.030 line:15%
It's just your disadvantage with that, but as opposed

3124
01:53:41.030 --> 01:53:43.730 line:15%
to where that was just dexterity ability checks--

3125
01:53:43.730 --> 01:53:46.239 line:15%
No, that's everything.

3126
01:53:46.239 --> 01:53:48.440 line:15%
Then the exhaustion is everything, yeah.

3127
01:53:49.620 --> 01:53:52.030 line:15%
No, I mean, I was already disadvantaged

3128
01:53:52.030 --> 01:53:53.990 line:15%
on every ability check.

3129
01:53:53.990 --> 01:53:56.700 line:15%
So now do I have more disadvantage?

3130
01:53:56.700 --> 01:53:57.533 line:15%
No, it's just--

3131
01:53:57.533 --> 01:53:58.366 line:15%
Okay, cool.
You're still okay.

3132
01:53:58.366 --> 01:54:00.370 line:15%
I'll take it.
Does not say.

3133
01:54:00.370 --> 01:54:01.770 line:15%
Jester.
19.

3134
01:54:01.770 --> 01:54:03.110 line:15%
19, you're fine.

3135
01:54:03.110 --> 01:54:03.943 line:15%
Caduceus?

3136
01:54:03.943 --> 01:54:05.650 line:15%
Nine.
Nine, point of exhaustion.

3137
01:54:05.650 --> 01:54:06.880 line:15%
Wow!

3138
01:54:06.880 --> 01:54:07.960 line:15%
Yasha?
17.

3139
01:54:07.960 --> 01:54:08.890 line:15%
17, you're fine.

3140
01:54:08.890 --> 01:54:10.340 line:15%
What is it disadvantage on that?

3141
01:54:10.340 --> 01:54:12.840 line:15%
Disadvantage on ability checks, just in general.

3142
01:54:13.870 --> 01:54:15.460 line:15%
Just a disadvantage in life.

3143
01:54:17.390 --> 01:54:19.210 line:15%
But you've made yourself part way

3144
01:54:19.210 --> 01:54:21.060 line:15%
into the swamp, and you're getting close

3145
01:54:21.060 --> 01:54:25.200 line:15%
to the very base center of this valley.

3146
01:54:25.200 --> 01:54:28.980 line:15%
The water in places is creeping up the knee to the thigh,

3147
01:54:28.980 --> 01:54:30.870 line:15%
and some of them, you have to push through waist-high,

3148
01:54:30.870 --> 01:54:33.490 line:15%
keeping your equipment in bags above you,

3149
01:54:33.490 --> 01:54:34.690 line:15%
as you slowly (slurps)--

3150
01:54:36.310 --> 01:54:37.143 line:15%
We still have

3151
01:54:37.143 --> 01:54:38.580 line:15%
to get two successes?
Push through the swamp.

3152
01:54:38.580 --> 01:54:39.413 line:15%
Yeah.
We got this.

3153
01:54:39.413 --> 01:54:40.246 line:15%
We got this.

3154
01:54:40.246 --> 01:54:41.240 line:15%
We're all at disadvantage now.

3155
01:54:41.240 --> 01:54:42.120 line:15%
Two and two, right?

3156
01:54:42.120 --> 01:54:43.400 line:15%
We're two for two.

3157
01:54:43.400 --> 01:54:44.910 line:15%
You have two victories.

3158
01:54:44.910 --> 01:54:48.200 line:15%
You need two more successes.
Two more victories.

3159
01:54:48.200 --> 01:54:50.580 line:15%
We got a lot more failures than victories.

3160
01:54:50.580 --> 01:54:51.920 line:15%
Caleb is going to pause for a moment

3161
01:54:51.920 --> 01:54:55.320 line:15%
and pull out a piece of obsidian and hold it to his chest

3162
01:54:55.320 --> 01:54:57.110 line:15%
and start casting in front of him,

3163
01:54:57.110 --> 01:55:02.110 line:15%
and a dark mirror image of Caleb (whooshes)

3164
01:55:02.880 --> 01:55:05.530 line:15%
comes into existence, casting Resonant Echo.

3165
01:55:05.530 --> 01:55:06.450 line:15%
Mm-hmm.

3166
01:55:06.450 --> 01:55:07.860 line:15%
So there is now a darker,

3167
01:55:07.860 --> 01:55:10.550 line:15%
shadier Caleb walking with Caleb.

3168
01:55:10.550 --> 01:55:12.330 line:15%
Okay, it's made mostly of like,

3169
01:55:12.330 --> 01:55:16.460 line:15%
it looks a material shadow or black smoke

3170
01:55:16.460 --> 01:55:19.700 line:15%
in a form that is very reminiscent of Caleb

3171
01:55:19.700 --> 01:55:22.370 line:15%
in almost every way, other than the fact

3172
01:55:22.370 --> 01:55:24.640 line:15%
that you can kind of see through it.

3173
01:55:24.640 --> 01:55:26.180 line:15%
He looks at one and goes,

3174
01:55:26.180 --> 01:55:27.500 line:15%
and the other one goes,

3175
01:55:27.500 --> 01:55:28.500 line:15%
and they start walking.

3176
01:55:28.500 --> 01:55:31.160 line:15%
Fjord, take note.

3177
01:55:31.160 --> 01:55:32.750 line:15%
Super mysterious.

3178
01:55:32.750 --> 01:55:34.250 line:15%
No idea what he's doing.

3179
01:55:34.250 --> 01:55:36.420 line:15%
He looks a little gothic and cool.

3180
01:55:36.420 --> 01:55:37.350 line:15%
Just a note.

3181
01:55:37.350 --> 01:55:39.830 line:15%
Is that how cool I look when I invoke Duplicity.

3182
01:55:39.830 --> 01:55:42.090 line:15%
Well, I mean, that thing is dark and brooding.

3183
01:55:42.090 --> 01:55:44.180 line:15%
The thing that you make is just so sweet.

3184
01:55:45.260 --> 01:55:46.320 line:15%
I mean, it looks cool.
Okay.

3185
01:55:46.320 --> 01:55:48.000 line:15%
It just doesn't look like dark.

3186
01:55:48.000 --> 01:55:49.010 line:15%
All right.

3187
01:55:49.010 --> 01:55:50.800 line:15%
I think Jester's very mysterious.

3188
01:55:50.800 --> 01:55:51.770 line:15%
Jester's the best.

3189
01:55:51.770 --> 01:55:53.360 line:15%
Thank you.

3190
01:55:53.360 --> 01:55:55.370 line:15%
Just not very dark.

3191
01:55:55.370 --> 01:55:59.060 line:15%
I will helm this next leg of the journey!

3192
01:55:59.060 --> 01:56:00.160 line:15%
All righty.

3193
01:56:00.160 --> 01:56:02.420 line:15%
How would you like to aid your party

3194
01:56:02.420 --> 01:56:03.570 line:15%
in traveling through the swamp?

3195
01:56:03.570 --> 01:56:04.780 line:15%
I will investigate--

3196
01:56:06.290 --> 01:56:07.123 line:15%
Okay.

3197
01:56:07.123 --> 01:56:08.860 line:15%
(laughs) The areas of the swamp,

3198
01:56:08.860 --> 01:56:12.360 line:15%
trying to glean from markings and things

3199
01:56:12.360 --> 01:56:17.080 line:15%
which direction animals have gone to circumvent dangers.

3200
01:56:17.080 --> 01:56:18.280 line:15%
Hmm?
Okay.

3201
01:56:18.280 --> 01:56:19.470 line:15%
That's good, that's good.

3202
01:56:19.470 --> 01:56:20.960 line:15%
Go ahead and make a check.

3203
01:56:20.960 --> 01:56:22.000 line:15%
Hey!
Ah!

3204
01:56:22.000 --> 01:56:24.583 line:15%
The Traveler believes in you.

3205
01:56:27.450 --> 01:56:29.870 line:15%
Oh wait, disadvantage.

3206
01:56:29.870 --> 01:56:30.718 line:15%
Hmm.

3207
01:56:30.718 --> 01:56:32.636 line:15%
Plus a d4.
Plus four.

3208
01:56:32.636 --> 01:56:33.469 line:15%
Ah, okay.

3209
01:56:34.360 --> 01:56:35.625 line:15%
Oh!

3210
01:56:35.625 --> 01:56:37.350 line:15%
LAURA: (giggles)

3211
01:56:37.350 --> 01:56:38.610 line:15%
Is this investigation?

3212
01:56:38.610 --> 01:56:39.443 line:15%
Yes.
Yeah.

3213
01:56:41.010 --> 01:56:42.340 line:15%
29!

3214
01:56:42.340 --> 01:56:44.640 line:15%
Whoa!
Wow, jeez.

3215
01:56:44.640 --> 01:56:46.690 line:15%
That'll be your third success (laughs).

3216
01:56:47.750 --> 01:56:50.630 line:15%
You do actually, keeping track of watching the various birds

3217
01:56:50.630 --> 01:56:53.170 line:15%
that travel through, markings for woodland creatures

3218
01:56:53.170 --> 01:56:55.300 line:15%
and sometimes larger than woodland creatures,

3219
01:56:55.300 --> 01:56:58.890 line:15%
you can see different patterns across the bark of the trees

3220
01:56:58.890 --> 01:57:02.130 line:15%
and elements of the stone and exposed earth outside

3221
01:57:02.130 --> 01:57:04.850 line:15%
of the water that show you the often-traveled paths

3222
01:57:04.850 --> 01:57:06.860 line:15%
of the denizens of this swamp,

3223
01:57:06.860 --> 01:57:10.140 line:15%
which, one, helps you stay in the safer route

3224
01:57:10.140 --> 01:57:11.960 line:15%
from any sort of natural hazards around you,

3225
01:57:11.960 --> 01:57:14.750 line:15%
two, helps you avoid crossing paths

3226
01:57:14.750 --> 01:57:19.750 line:15%
with where some of the more predatory denizens might be.

3227
01:57:20.360 --> 01:57:24.890 line:15%
So with that, you push through a majority of the swamp,

3228
01:57:24.890 --> 01:57:27.520 line:15%
exiting where the deepest parts of the waters are

3229
01:57:27.520 --> 01:57:29.610 line:15%
and begin to make your way up the incline

3230
01:57:29.610 --> 01:57:31.330 line:15%
towards the base of Mount Mentiri.

3231
01:57:32.370 --> 01:57:34.170 line:15%
You grow close to the end of this journey,

3232
01:57:34.170 --> 01:57:37.940 line:15%
towards where, at least you assume, the home

3233
01:57:37.940 --> 01:57:40.650 line:15%
of this sage might be.

3234
01:57:40.650 --> 01:57:41.930 line:15%
Who wants to handle this next leg of the journey?

3235
01:57:41.930 --> 01:57:43.620 line:15%
Should we sleep?

3236
01:57:43.620 --> 01:57:45.210 line:15%
What time is it?
Should we take a short rest?

3237
01:57:45.210 --> 01:57:46.770 line:15%
It's been a half hour.

3238
01:57:46.770 --> 01:57:48.590 line:15%
At this point, you've been traveling

3239
01:57:48.590 --> 01:57:51.770 line:15%
since very early in the day, when you guys left.

3240
01:57:51.770 --> 01:57:55.270 line:15%
You gather you're probably about two hours out from dusk.

3241
01:57:57.090 --> 01:57:59.810 line:15%
I feel like if we can just get a little bit further,

3242
01:57:59.810 --> 01:58:00.980 line:15%
we'll be better off.

3243
01:58:00.980 --> 01:58:02.200 line:15%
What if we get a little bit further,

3244
01:58:02.200 --> 01:58:03.780 line:15%
and the hut's, like, right there.

3245
01:58:03.780 --> 01:58:05.790 line:15%
Then the witch, like, knows of everything

3246
01:58:05.790 --> 01:58:07.410 line:15%
that's within, like, range of her,

3247
01:58:07.410 --> 01:58:09.320 line:15%
and then she comes and she attacks us in the night,

3248
01:58:09.320 --> 01:58:11.100 line:15%
and then we all die, because we're exhausted?

3249
01:58:11.100 --> 01:58:12.690 line:15%
I could use a short rest.

3250
01:58:12.690 --> 01:58:13.523 line:15%
A short rest?

3251
01:58:13.523 --> 01:58:15.020 line:15%
But I mean, if you short rest,

3252
01:58:15.020 --> 01:58:16.150 line:15%
then it's going to be nighttime.

3253
01:58:16.150 --> 01:58:18.220 line:15%
I say we press on until we get closer.

3254
01:58:18.220 --> 01:58:19.080 line:15%
Okay.

3255
01:58:19.080 --> 01:58:20.508 line:15%
I could helm this last bit.

3256
01:58:20.508 --> 01:58:23.050 line:15%
There's nowhere to--
Do it, Fjord!

3257
01:58:23.050 --> 01:58:25.740 line:15%
This is not a good stopping point, I assume.

3258
01:58:25.740 --> 01:58:26.970 line:15%
It doesn't seem to be a--

3259
01:58:26.970 --> 01:58:28.670 line:15%
Yeah, it's not a happy, fun place.

3260
01:58:28.670 --> 01:58:31.379 line:15%
Ah, you can camp in the middle of a swamp, sure.

3261
01:58:31.379 --> 01:58:33.240 line:15%
TRAVIS: (laughs)

3262
01:58:33.240 --> 01:58:35.550 line:15%
Yeah, let's just get to high ground.

3263
01:58:35.550 --> 01:58:39.850 line:15%
I will use Mask of Many Faces

3264
01:58:39.850 --> 01:58:43.710 line:15%
to make myself look like an undead harpy,

3265
01:58:43.710 --> 01:58:47.180 line:15%
that we just killed, and I will try

3266
01:58:47.180 --> 01:58:51.609 line:15%
and deceive my way through the swamp,

3267
01:58:51.609 --> 01:58:52.442 line:15%
(laughter)

3268
01:58:52.442 --> 01:58:55.810 line:15%
acting like I know where I'm going,

3269
01:58:55.810 --> 01:58:57.730 line:15%
all the way.
So you don't know

3270
01:58:57.730 --> 01:58:59.850 line:15%
where you're going?
You're all bullshit,

3271
01:58:59.850 --> 01:59:01.217 line:15%
right there?
TRAVIS: (squawking)

3272
01:59:01.217 --> 01:59:03.467 line:15%
So you're just going to make squawking sounds?

3273
01:59:04.937 --> 01:59:07.929 line:15%
We're going to let Fjord go about 20 feet in front of us.

3274
01:59:07.929 --> 01:59:08.976 line:15%
20?
Sure, sure.

3275
01:59:08.976 --> 01:59:10.130 line:15%
How about 100?
That's a good call.

3276
01:59:10.130 --> 01:59:11.900 line:15%
He's method acting his way there.

3277
01:59:13.640 --> 01:59:17.180 line:15%
I'm going to Guidance him in some way.

3278
01:59:17.180 --> 01:59:18.150 line:15%
I'm delighted

3279
01:59:18.150 --> 01:59:19.450 line:15%
that I'll be connected-
Sure,

3280
01:59:19.450 --> 01:59:20.680 line:15%
I believe in you.
To this terrible idea.

3281
01:59:20.680 --> 01:59:22.466 line:15%
What inspires harpies?

3282
01:59:22.466 --> 01:59:25.687 line:15%
(laughter)

3283
01:59:25.687 --> 01:59:26.520 line:15%
How do they move?

3284
01:59:26.520 --> 01:59:28.980 line:15%
All right, if you're going to inspire on this,

3285
01:59:28.980 --> 01:59:31.590 line:15%
I will say that will put you adjacent to the undead harpy,

3286
01:59:31.590 --> 01:59:33.990 line:15%
because you only have six seconds for Guidance to last.

3287
01:59:33.990 --> 01:59:34.823 line:15%
Oh.
Yeah.

3288
01:59:36.470 --> 01:59:37.560 line:15%
Okay.

3289
01:59:37.560 --> 01:59:38.760 line:15%
You don't have to.
Can I assist?

3290
01:59:38.760 --> 01:59:40.790 line:15%
Guidance is fun.

3291
01:59:40.790 --> 01:59:42.880 line:15%
If you want to walk ahead with him?

3292
01:59:42.880 --> 01:59:44.130 line:15%
I'll walk ahead with him.

3293
01:59:44.130 --> 01:59:48.060 line:15%
Okay, so you have one undead harpy and a Yasha,

3294
01:59:48.060 --> 01:59:53.060 line:15%
both hobbling through the last elements of the swamp.

3295
01:59:56.470 --> 01:59:57.347 line:15%
Roll.

3296
01:59:57.347 --> 01:59:59.304 line:15%
(laughter)

3297
01:59:59.304 --> 02:00:01.400 line:15%
At disadvantage, right, or is it a straight roll?

3298
02:00:01.400 --> 02:00:03.300 line:15%
Well, it's disadvantage if you have a point of exhaustion.

3299
02:00:03.300 --> 02:00:04.133 line:15%
I do.

3300
02:00:04.133 --> 02:00:04.966 line:15%
So it's just a single roll.

3301
02:00:04.966 --> 02:00:06.050 line:15%
Disappear.

3302
02:00:06.050 --> 02:00:07.608 line:15%
And it's a real high DC.
It's the last thing

3303
02:00:07.608 --> 02:00:09.030 line:15%
we'll ever see.

3304
02:00:09.030 --> 02:00:10.780 line:15%
A rock scoops him up in one bite.

3305
02:00:11.700 --> 02:00:12.760 line:15%
Natural 20.

3306
02:00:12.760 --> 02:00:14.310 line:15%
Did you give me Guidance?

3307
02:00:14.310 --> 02:00:15.210 line:15%
No, I didn't.

3308
02:00:15.210 --> 02:00:17.960 line:15%
Oh, well, that would've helped, 16.

3309
02:00:17.960 --> 02:00:18.890 line:15%
16.

3310
02:00:26.880 --> 02:00:31.100 line:15%
The mists around you don't seem

3311
02:00:31.100 --> 02:00:34.970 line:15%
to bear any sort of emotional connection

3312
02:00:38.560 --> 02:00:42.670 line:15%
to an undead harpy or a wandering aasimar barbarian.

3313
02:00:44.440 --> 02:00:48.290 line:15%
The shadows in these mists are different

3314
02:00:48.290 --> 02:00:50.780 line:15%
from the ones you pass through naturally.

3315
02:00:50.780 --> 02:00:53.690 line:15%
As your proximity grows closer to Mount Mentiri

3316
02:00:53.690 --> 02:00:56.200 line:15%
and perhaps some of the things that call its base

3317
02:00:56.200 --> 02:01:00.450 line:15%
and mountainsides home, something sinister curls

3318
02:01:00.450 --> 02:01:02.160 line:15%
from the surrounding fog.

3319
02:01:03.280 --> 02:01:06.410 line:15%
It enwraps you to the point where you find yourself

3320
02:01:06.410 --> 02:01:08.860 line:15%
coughing it out of breath for a moment,

3321
02:01:09.710 --> 02:01:11.900 line:15%
as do you, as do all of you.

3322
02:01:11.900 --> 02:01:16.900 line:15%
I need everyone to make a constitution-saving throw, please.

3323
02:01:18.074 --> 02:01:18.907 line:15%
Everyone?

3324
02:01:18.907 --> 02:01:20.350 line:15%
Constitution-saving throw at a...

3325
02:01:22.772 --> 02:01:24.527 line:15%
This thing is cocked, all the time.

3326
02:01:24.527 --> 02:01:25.360 line:15%
Terrible.
13.

3327
02:01:25.360 --> 02:01:26.280 line:15%
Yeah, it's that dice.

3328
02:01:26.280 --> 02:01:27.560 line:15%
13.
Disadvantage?

3329
02:01:27.560 --> 02:01:29.860 line:15%
You manage to resist it.
No, it's a save.

3330
02:01:31.390 --> 02:01:32.223 line:15%
Nine.

3331
02:01:32.223 --> 02:01:35.020 line:15%
Nine, I rolled shitty, so you take three points

3332
02:01:35.020 --> 02:01:39.400 line:15%
of necrotic damage, and your max HP is reduced by three.

3333
02:01:39.400 --> 02:01:41.030 line:15%
Ooh.

3334
02:01:41.030 --> 02:01:42.320 line:15%
Oh, they failed it.
24.

3335
02:01:42.320 --> 02:01:44.280 line:15%
24, you're fine.

3336
02:01:44.280 --> 02:01:45.360 line:15%
11.

3337
02:01:45.360 --> 02:01:47.580 line:15%
11, you take three points of necrotic damage,

3338
02:01:47.580 --> 02:01:49.380 line:15%
and your max HP is reduced by three.

3339
02:01:50.430 --> 02:01:51.263 line:15%
20.

3340
02:01:51.263 --> 02:01:52.096 line:15%
20, you are fine.

3341
02:01:52.096 --> 02:01:53.390 line:15%
Caduceus?
10.

3342
02:01:53.390 --> 02:01:55.350 line:15%
10, take three points of necrotic damage,

3343
02:01:55.350 --> 02:01:57.010 line:15%
and your max HP is reduced by three.

3344
02:01:57.010 --> 02:01:57.843 line:15%
11.

3345
02:01:57.843 --> 02:01:59.280 line:15%
11, you as well.

3346
02:01:59.280 --> 02:02:01.290 line:15%
Is that a poison that we're inhaling?

3347
02:02:02.310 --> 02:02:04.140 line:15%
There is something within the mist

3348
02:02:04.140 --> 02:02:08.420 line:15%
that has a dark, ghostly energy.

3349
02:02:08.420 --> 02:02:11.520 line:15%
Then once it seems to have feasted on your life essence,

3350
02:02:11.520 --> 02:02:16.310 line:15%
it vanishes off into the fog, satiated and hard to trace.

3351
02:02:17.290 --> 02:02:18.850 line:15%
I'll drop the undead harpy.

3352
02:02:18.850 --> 02:02:19.683 line:15%
Okay.

3353
02:02:21.380 --> 02:02:22.370 line:15%
You're growing close still,

3354
02:02:22.370 --> 02:02:24.620 line:15%
and you can see heavy brambles ahead.

3355
02:02:24.620 --> 02:02:29.620 line:15%
In fact, there is a series of tangled, heavy bramble vines

3356
02:02:30.630 --> 02:02:34.240 line:15%
that will very soon, probably, begin to prevent you

3357
02:02:34.240 --> 02:02:37.050 line:15%
from traversing, unless anyone's particularly clever.

3358
02:02:39.410 --> 02:02:42.540 line:15%
You can see these heavy, root-like twists

3359
02:02:42.540 --> 02:02:45.890 line:15%
and knots that are covered in these varying sized,

3360
02:02:45.890 --> 02:02:48.750 line:15%
natural points and pikes that emerge

3361
02:02:48.750 --> 02:02:52.730 line:15%
from the wood, rose thorns the size

3362
02:02:52.730 --> 02:02:55.770 line:15%
of short swords and daggers.

3363
02:02:55.770 --> 02:02:58.020 line:15%
Yasha, cut through them with your strength!

3364
02:03:01.702 --> 02:03:02.535 line:15%
I can try.

3365
02:03:05.358 --> 02:03:06.560 line:15%
What are you going to do?

3366
02:03:06.560 --> 02:03:08.710 line:15%
I'll wait till we have 10 minutes to stop,

3367
02:03:08.710 --> 02:03:10.520 line:15%
and then, because it takes 10 minutes of--

3368
02:03:10.520 --> 02:03:12.110 line:15%
What does?
We could take 10 minutes.

3369
02:03:12.110 --> 02:03:14.010 line:15%
Just to give everybody a little--

3370
02:03:14.010 --> 02:03:17.270 line:15%
Prayer of Healing.
Prayer of Healing.

3371
02:03:17.270 --> 02:03:18.650 line:15%
I think we should take 10 minutes.

3372
02:03:18.650 --> 02:03:20.140 line:15%
Yeah, take 10 minutes.

3373
02:03:20.140 --> 02:03:21.078 line:15%
Okay.
Take 10 minutes.

3374
02:03:21.078 --> 02:03:21.911 line:15%
Yup.
Okay.

3375
02:03:21.911 --> 02:03:25.040 line:15%
So as you've emerged from the swamp waters

3376
02:03:25.040 --> 02:03:29.280 line:15%
and make your way towards the cusp of this bramble wall

3377
02:03:29.280 --> 02:03:32.230 line:15%
around the forest, you stop for 10 minutes

3378
02:03:32.230 --> 02:03:33.570 line:15%
and go ahead and cast Prayer of Healing,

3379
02:03:33.570 --> 02:03:35.180 line:15%
and that heals everyone?

3380
02:03:35.180 --> 02:03:38.260 line:15%
That heals, actually, not quite everybody.

3381
02:03:38.260 --> 02:03:39.093 line:15%
Six targets?

3382
02:03:39.093 --> 02:03:39.926 line:15%
Six targets, so--

3383
02:03:39.926 --> 02:03:41.910 line:15%
I'm good.
One, two, three, four,

3384
02:03:41.910 --> 02:03:43.940 line:15%
five, everyone but Beau, so four.

3385
02:03:43.940 --> 02:03:45.640 line:15%
Does Beau not need it at all?

3386
02:03:45.640 --> 02:03:47.810 line:15%
I'm down by my max healing, so I'm good.

3387
02:03:47.810 --> 02:03:49.120 line:15%
I can't heal past that anyway.

3388
02:03:49.120 --> 02:03:51.620 line:15%
I'm good.
So everyone gets...

3389
02:03:58.165 --> 02:04:00.380 line:15%
I did it at 2nd-level, so yeah,

3390
02:04:00.380 --> 02:04:03.590 line:15%
oh, I did it 3rd-level, so it's 3d8.

3391
02:04:03.590 --> 02:04:04.460 line:15%
That's a lot.

3392
02:04:07.880 --> 02:04:08.910 line:15%
17 points.

3393
02:04:08.910 --> 02:04:09.960 line:15%
Wow.

3394
02:04:09.960 --> 02:04:10.793 line:15%
All righty.

3395
02:04:11.780 --> 02:04:13.630 line:15%
So everyone else heals 17 hit points,

3396
02:04:16.090 --> 02:04:18.610 line:15%
and you finish the rest of your walk up towards the edge

3397
02:04:18.610 --> 02:04:20.020 line:15%
of this heavy bramble wall.

3398
02:04:23.640 --> 02:04:26.210 line:15%
Well, I could sort of--

3399
02:04:27.390 --> 02:04:28.910 line:15%
Use, like, Sleight of Hand?

3400
02:04:28.910 --> 02:04:33.410 line:15%
I could get through it with my sort of stealthy skills,

3401
02:04:33.410 --> 02:04:35.410 line:15%
or you could flip your way through the briar patch.

3402
02:04:35.410 --> 02:04:36.900 line:15%
You could just fireball that wall.

3403
02:04:36.900 --> 02:04:37.800 line:15%
Oh yeah.
Or Yasha could

3404
02:04:37.800 --> 02:04:38.920 line:15%
cut her way through.
Is there a canopy

3405
02:04:38.920 --> 02:04:41.220 line:15%
of trees still here, or are we more in--

3406
02:04:41.220 --> 02:04:42.053 line:15%
There is.

3407
02:04:42.053 --> 02:04:43.780 line:15%
Rage through it.
We can try Sacred Flame

3408
02:04:43.780 --> 02:04:45.630 line:15%
on the brambles and see.

3409
02:04:45.630 --> 02:04:46.640 line:15%
Sure.

3410
02:04:46.640 --> 02:04:48.760 line:15%
I'm going to try Sacred Flame on the brambles

3411
02:04:48.760 --> 02:04:51.490 line:15%
and see if I can set some of it on fire,

3412
02:04:51.490 --> 02:04:53.200 line:15%
to try to clear it out.

3413
02:04:53.200 --> 02:04:54.033 line:15%
Okay.

3414
02:04:55.350 --> 02:04:58.140 line:15%
You cast Sacred Flame and the radiant energy

3415
02:04:58.140 --> 02:04:59.690 line:15%
surrounds and focuses one area.

3416
02:04:59.690 --> 02:05:02.580 line:15%
You can see elements of the bramble blacken.

3417
02:05:02.580 --> 02:05:06.730 line:15%
They are very moist, and the fire doesn't catch.

3418
02:05:06.730 --> 02:05:09.790 line:15%
The Sacred Flame is not a super-heated flame

3419
02:05:09.790 --> 02:05:11.730 line:15%
as much as it is a radiant blast,

3420
02:05:11.730 --> 02:05:14.300 line:15%
so it doesn't seem to have a strong effect on the brambles.

3421
02:05:14.300 --> 02:05:16.820 line:15%
As long as we've gone that far, Caleb will follow up

3422
02:05:16.820 --> 02:05:18.820 line:15%
and hit the same spot with literal fire,

3423
02:05:19.670 --> 02:05:20.503 line:15%
just a Fire Bolt.

3424
02:05:20.503 --> 02:05:21.350 line:15%
Just a Fire Bolt?
Yeah.

3425
02:05:21.350 --> 02:05:22.940 line:15%
It hits, and you see the brambles darken.

3426
02:05:22.940 --> 02:05:25.140 line:15%
There's a little bit of a glow.

3427
02:05:25.140 --> 02:05:27.250 line:15%
It's burnable, but it would take

3428
02:05:27.250 --> 02:05:28.934 line:15%
a vast amount of fire.
I wonder they make it

3429
02:05:28.934 --> 02:05:30.440 line:15%
more brittle, though.

3430
02:05:30.440 --> 02:05:31.800 line:15%
I'll try to cut through it.

3431
02:05:31.800 --> 02:05:33.260 line:15%
In that same spot?

3432
02:05:33.260 --> 02:05:34.140 line:15%
You're going to rage through it?

3433
02:05:34.140 --> 02:05:34.973 line:15%
Yeah.

3434
02:05:34.973 --> 02:05:36.390 line:15%
So you're going to attempt to carve through the brambles?

3435
02:05:36.390 --> 02:05:39.020 line:15%
Just the brittly--
Has to be a check here.

3436
02:05:39.020 --> 02:05:40.020 line:15%
Yeah.
Okay.

3437
02:05:40.020 --> 02:05:42.150 line:15%
So go ahead and make a strength ability check,

3438
02:05:43.860 --> 02:05:45.180 line:15%
Let me give you a d4,

3439
02:05:45.180 --> 02:05:46.780 line:15%
going into that.
Goddammit.

3440
02:05:48.370 --> 02:05:50.655 line:15%
Natural 20.
Never mind, yeah.

3441
02:05:50.655 --> 02:05:52.020 line:15%
Do you have a point of exhaustion,

3442
02:05:52.020 --> 02:05:53.970 line:15%
or did you resist that?

3443
02:05:53.970 --> 02:05:55.560 line:15%
I resisted it.

3444
02:05:55.560 --> 02:05:57.190 line:15%
Correct.

3445
02:05:57.190 --> 02:05:58.740 line:15%
And you have an advantage on your strength check?

3446
02:05:58.740 --> 02:06:00.230 line:15%
Are you raging in advance of it?

3447
02:06:00.230 --> 02:06:01.657 line:15%
Oh no, it was just cocked when she rolled the first time.

3448
02:06:01.657 --> 02:06:03.730 line:15%
Oh, got you, okay.
Yeah, yeah.

3449
02:06:03.730 --> 02:06:05.110 line:15%
So natural 20.
Natural 20.

3450
02:06:05.110 --> 02:06:06.020 line:15%
Okay.
Whew!

3451
02:06:06.890 --> 02:06:09.790 line:15%
So that little part of the bramble twists there,

3452
02:06:09.790 --> 02:06:12.580 line:15%
that you guys have slightly damaged a bit,

3453
02:06:12.580 --> 02:06:15.320 line:15%
Yasha wielding which blade of your choice?

3454
02:06:15.320 --> 02:06:17.180 line:15%
Skingorger.
Skingorger,

3455
02:06:17.180 --> 02:06:22.180 line:15%
this really terrifying-looking, dual-handed,

3456
02:06:22.560 --> 02:06:26.580 line:15%
front-edged blade of rust and jagged edge,

3457
02:06:26.580 --> 02:06:28.130 line:15%
just (whooshes) carves through,

3458
02:06:28.130 --> 02:06:30.750 line:15%
and the bramble (crunches) collapses inward,

3459
02:06:30.750 --> 02:06:33.390 line:15%
and a second strike and a third strike,

3460
02:06:33.390 --> 02:06:35.290 line:15%
and one after another, you begin to carve your way

3461
02:06:35.290 --> 02:06:36.600 line:15%
through this bramble forest.

3462
02:06:36.600 --> 02:06:39.990 line:15%
It's slow-going, and it continues on

3463
02:06:39.990 --> 02:06:42.780 line:15%
for another 60 or so feet.

3464
02:06:42.780 --> 02:06:44.000 line:15%
Whoa.

3465
02:06:44.000 --> 02:06:46.750 line:15%
But with the size of the blade and the sheer immensity

3466
02:06:46.750 --> 02:06:49.180 line:15%
of your strength, with a natural 20,

3467
02:06:49.180 --> 02:06:51.350 line:15%
you begin to carve a path through that is safe enough

3468
02:06:51.350 --> 02:06:55.029 line:15%
for you to travel single-file, without taking any damage.

3469
02:06:55.029 --> 02:06:56.750 line:15%
Nice!

3470
02:06:56.750 --> 02:06:59.480 line:15%
Caleb turns to his double and says, after you,

3471
02:06:59.480 --> 02:07:00.650 line:15%
and the shadow walks in,

3472
02:07:00.650 --> 02:07:01.740 line:15%
and he follows.
All right.

3473
02:07:02.600 --> 02:07:04.350 line:15%
You guys follow Yasha's lead until eventually,

3474
02:07:04.350 --> 02:07:05.960 line:15%
you get to that final element of the bramble,

3475
02:07:05.960 --> 02:07:08.660 line:15%
and you cut through, and as you slice that last bit,

3476
02:07:08.660 --> 02:07:10.520 line:15%
and it falls away, you can see now

3477
02:07:10.520 --> 02:07:14.160 line:15%
that large bramble wall begins to fall away,

3478
02:07:14.160 --> 02:07:17.430 line:15%
and you can see the brush and the hill rise up,

3479
02:07:18.270 --> 02:07:19.690 line:15%
and you can see more of the trees ahead,

3480
02:07:19.690 --> 02:07:21.500 line:15%
some of them still petrified,

3481
02:07:21.500 --> 02:07:24.040 line:15%
though the gray coloration

3482
02:07:24.040 --> 02:07:26.880 line:15%
of their branches growing more and more present,

3483
02:07:27.730 --> 02:07:29.700 line:15%
as you get closer to Mount Mentiri.

3484
02:07:29.700 --> 02:07:30.950 line:15%
You can smell that sulfurous scent,

3485
02:07:30.950 --> 02:07:33.430 line:15%
but something else hits your nose as well,

3486
02:07:33.430 --> 02:07:36.140 line:15%
a heavy, asphalt smell.

3487
02:07:37.200 --> 02:07:38.070 line:15%
As you begin to look ahead,

3488
02:07:38.070 --> 02:07:39.940 line:15%
you can see small patches in the ground,

3489
02:07:39.940 --> 02:07:42.180 line:15%
where a black tar-like substance seems

3490
02:07:42.180 --> 02:07:44.200 line:15%
to be pushing through the floor,

3491
02:07:45.650 --> 02:07:48.920 line:15%
little black puddles, thick, and reaches.

3492
02:07:51.020 --> 02:07:55.100 line:15%
Continuing forward, you can see the stone

3493
02:07:55.100 --> 02:07:58.500 line:15%
and the earth of the area beginning

3494
02:07:58.500 --> 02:08:01.010 line:15%
to turn more deep red, at the mountain.

3495
02:08:02.050 --> 02:08:03.400 line:15%
Some areas are almost yellow,

3496
02:08:03.400 --> 02:08:05.280 line:15%
like a dust has gathered on them.

3497
02:08:06.270 --> 02:08:08.760 line:15%
There are a couple of small, little steam vents

3498
02:08:08.760 --> 02:08:13.760 line:15%
that are releasing this lazy trail of heated moisture

3499
02:08:13.790 --> 02:08:16.690 line:15%
that dissipates and joins the rest of the mist around you.

3500
02:08:17.660 --> 02:08:19.660 line:15%
The fog is not as strong and as intense

3501
02:08:19.660 --> 02:08:22.470 line:15%
as it was deep in the swamp, but there is a low-lying fog

3502
02:08:22.470 --> 02:08:24.600 line:15%
that coasts about a foot and half off the ground,

3503
02:08:24.600 --> 02:08:26.050 line:15%
universally, over this space.

3504
02:08:26.910 --> 02:08:30.000 line:15%
As you push forward, the trees thin a bit,

3505
02:08:31.220 --> 02:08:34.960 line:15%
and you can see there are a few little elements

3506
02:08:34.960 --> 02:08:38.080 line:15%
on the ground where the elevation shifts a bit,

3507
02:08:38.080 --> 02:08:42.000 line:15%
and ahead, there is one mild hill, where,

3508
02:08:42.000 --> 02:08:45.430 line:15%
through the fog and mist, you can see a frame.

3509
02:08:47.240 --> 02:08:49.443 line:15%
You can see almost a porch

3510
02:08:49.443 --> 02:08:51.030 line:15%
SAM: (gasps)

3511
02:08:51.030 --> 02:08:55.900 line:15%
of a home, no more than maybe 15, 20 foot, end to end,

3512
02:08:56.970 --> 02:09:01.970 line:15%
a heavy-thatched top to it that is green,

3513
02:09:04.210 --> 02:09:07.260 line:15%
brightly green with moss and mold and other sorts

3514
02:09:07.260 --> 02:09:09.360 line:15%
of natural growth that has taken root.

3515
02:09:10.210 --> 02:09:12.170 line:15%
It's like a cabin put together

3516
02:09:12.170 --> 02:09:15.350 line:15%
from numerous thin, tall trees.

3517
02:09:16.290 --> 02:09:18.590 line:15%
You see hanging from the outside of it,

3518
02:09:18.590 --> 02:09:23.040 line:15%
from elements of chain and rope, look to be hooks,

3519
02:09:23.040 --> 02:09:24.480 line:15%
what would be for lanterns

3520
02:09:24.480 --> 02:09:26.710 line:15%
or tools or implements, who knows?

3521
02:09:28.280 --> 02:09:32.610 line:15%
There is a wooden rack, off to the side of the porch,

3522
02:09:32.610 --> 02:09:36.240 line:15%
that contains handful of leathers that are stretched out.

3523
02:09:37.870 --> 02:09:39.140 line:15%
What kind of leathers?

3524
02:09:39.140 --> 02:09:39.973 line:15%
Oh yeah.

3525
02:09:39.973 --> 02:09:40.806 line:15%
Can't really tell from this distance.

3526
02:09:40.806 --> 02:09:41.639 line:15%
Oh shit.

3527
02:09:41.639 --> 02:09:43.660 line:15%
There is a door that is partially ajar,

3528
02:09:43.660 --> 02:09:46.610 line:15%
and there is a warm light from the inside.

3529
02:09:49.550 --> 02:09:50.383 line:15%
And that's where we're going to take a break.

3530
02:09:50.383 --> 02:09:51.850 line:15%
(groaning)

3531
02:09:51.850 --> 02:09:52.895 line:15%
You bastard.

3532
02:09:52.895 --> 02:09:54.081 line:15%
Mm.

3533
02:09:54.081 --> 02:09:55.100 line:15%
We'll return here in a few minutes

3534
02:09:55.100 --> 02:09:56.460 line:15%
to see what this house is.

3535
02:09:56.460 --> 02:09:58.610 line:15%
I wonder!
What is this house?

3536
02:09:58.610 --> 02:09:59.780
It could just be somebody's house.

3537
02:09:59.780 --> 02:10:00.750
Probably.

3538
02:10:00.750 --> 02:10:02.900
In the interim, we do have our Wyrmwood giveaway,

3539
02:10:02.900 --> 02:10:03.733
at the break.

3540
02:10:03.733 --> 02:10:07.070
We have the black poisonwood dice vault here.

3541
02:10:07.070 --> 02:10:08.960
Boop, it opens up.

3542
02:10:08.960 --> 02:10:09.793
It's nice.

3543
02:10:09.793 --> 02:10:10.626
It smells nice.

3544
02:10:10.626 --> 02:10:11.860
What we do is we smell Wyrmwood.

3545
02:10:12.894 --> 02:10:14.120
It has mild hallucinogenic properties.

3546
02:10:14.120 --> 02:10:15.608
That's not true, do not quote me on that.

3547
02:10:15.608 --> 02:10:16.530
LAURA: (laughing)

3548
02:10:16.530 --> 02:10:18.570
But one lucky winner will have this,

3549
02:10:18.570 --> 02:10:19.720
when we come back from the break.

3550
02:10:19.720 --> 02:10:24.010

VO: Knights of Pen &amp; Paper II,

3583
02:11:39.360 --> 02:11:41.970
the game where you simulate a game master,

3584
02:11:41.970 --> 02:11:44.280
the game players in a rousing world

3585
02:11:44.280 --> 02:11:48.240
of bizarre pop culture adventuring, for free!

3586
02:11:51.570 --> 02:11:54.770
Amass a hideously unreasonable horde of ill-gotten loot,

3587
02:11:54.770 --> 02:11:57.630
without sacrificing any of your own.

3588
02:11:57.630 --> 02:12:01.020
Enjoy all of the randomly generated dungeons,

3589
02:12:01.020 --> 02:12:04.750
customizable monster battles and dicey dilemmas of Paperos

3590
02:12:04.750 --> 02:12:07.910
with your own party of simulated friends.

3591
02:12:07.910 --> 02:12:09.900
Never argue with anyone about who has

3592
02:12:09.900 --> 02:12:12.110
to play the healer, ever again.

3593
02:12:12.950 --> 02:12:17.610
Travel the land on a horse whose run cycle utterly screams,

3594
02:12:17.610 --> 02:12:21.730
sweet mercy, this game must be free!

3595
02:12:23.330 --> 02:12:27.870
Knights of Pen &amp; Paper II, the game where you pretend

3596
02:12:27.870 --> 02:12:30.960
to be adults pretending to be wizards,

3597
02:12:31.970 --> 02:12:35.147
like nature intended, hmm.

LAURA: Yay!

3607

Nice, episodes, 69 episodes, six levels,

3608
02:14:03.050 --> 02:14:05.660 line:15%
and 212 Exandrian days

3609
02:14:05.660 --> 02:14:07.810 line:15%

3610

the reformed bandits.
LAURA: (burps)

3611
02:14:09.690 --> 02:14:10.660 line:15%
Oh god, it's, like, stuck.
That was a

3612
02:14:10.660 --> 02:14:11.830 line:15%
little bit better.
It's stuck!

3613
02:14:11.830 --> 02:14:13.269 line:15%
BRIAN: No, let it out, man.

3614
02:14:13.269 --> 02:14:14.290 line:15%
I can't.

DANI: You have to pound on your stomach or something.

3616
02:14:16.440 --> 02:14:17.780
God.
Right on your diaphragm.

3617
02:14:17.780 --> 02:14:20.050
That's what this hour is for.

3618
02:14:20.050 --> 02:14:22.170
This hour is just going to be slowly getting burps out.

3619
02:14:22.170 --> 02:14:23.003
I'm sorry.

3620
02:14:23.003 --> 02:14:25.150
There is a kraken--
Because I swallowed

3621
02:14:25.150 --> 02:14:25.983
that first one.
In your chest.

3622
02:14:25.983 --> 02:14:28.010
I'm not one to comment on a woman's appearance,

3623
02:14:28.010 --> 02:14:29.972
but you look like, uh (laughs)--

3624
02:14:29.972 --> 02:14:31.740
Oh god.
LAURA: (laughing)

3625
02:14:31.740 --> 02:14:33.800
You kind of look like Ripley,

3626
02:14:33.800 --> 02:14:37.139
if she unwillingly got, like, a E! Makeover.

3627
02:14:37.139 --> 02:14:39.722
(laughter)

3628
02:14:40.594 --> 02:14:44.554
Then you go, well, I guess it's actually kind of cool.

3629
02:14:44.554 --> 02:14:45.740
MARISHA: Oh wow.

3630
02:14:45.740 --> 02:14:46.840
Wow.
LAURA: (snickers)

3631
02:14:46.840 --> 02:14:49.370
I think that was (laughs).

3632
02:14:49.370 --> 02:14:50.203
What?

3633
02:14:50.203 --> 02:14:51.590
That was sincere.

3634
02:14:51.590 --> 02:14:53.010
No, there's--

3635
02:14:53.010 --> 02:14:54.255
Are you still making noise?
I am having

3636
02:14:54.255 --> 02:14:59.255
an audio experience over here.
Jiminy Christmas.

3637
02:14:59.674 --> 02:15:03.250
It's like a Burning Man art installation,

3638
02:15:03.250 --> 02:15:06.300
and you have to be within a certain radius.

3639
02:15:06.300 --> 02:15:08.403
BRIAN: You're no longer America's sweetheart.

3640
02:15:08.403 --> 02:15:09.448
MARISHA: (laughs)

3641
02:15:09.448 --> 02:15:10.281
DANI: Lies.

3642
02:15:10.281 --> 02:15:11.649
No.
You're America's sweet-fart.

3643
02:15:11.649 --> 02:15:12.973
MARISHA and LAURA: Oh!

3644
02:15:12.973 --> 02:15:14.310
#AmericasSweetFart.

3645
02:15:14.310 --> 02:15:15.143
That's good.

3646
02:15:15.143 --> 02:15:16.490
DANI: No, don't make that a hashtag.

3647
02:15:16.490 --> 02:15:17.720
LAURA: (laughs)

3648
02:15:17.720 --> 02:15:19.880
Zack, get something drawn up for this week.

3649
02:15:19.880 --> 02:15:20.970
No!
No!

3650
02:15:20.970 --> 02:15:22.550
All right.
Don't do it, Zack!

3651
02:15:22.550 --> 02:15:23.383
I'm serious.

3652
02:15:23.383 --> 02:15:25.300
I'm serious, I'm serious.
Nope, he has been ordered

3653
02:15:25.300 --> 02:15:26.140 line:15%
not to listen to you.

3654
02:15:26.140 --> 02:15:28.420 line:15%
Marisha, after telling him about the plan

3655
02:15:28.420 --> 02:15:30.440 line:15%
to find the fortune teller,

3656
02:15:30.440 --> 02:15:33.940 line:15%
does Beau believe her father genuinely cares for her safety?

3657
02:15:33.940 --> 02:15:35.610 line:15%
Or does she think he's just putting on an act

3658
02:15:35.610 --> 02:15:37.260 line:15%
for the group of people watching?

3659
02:15:38.610 --> 02:15:43.610 line:15%
I think he cares to the extent that anyone cares

3660
02:15:45.210 --> 02:15:47.840 line:15%
about anyone's general safety.

3661
02:15:47.840 --> 02:15:48.840 line:15%
LAURA: (laughs)
Right.

3662
02:15:48.840 --> 02:15:49.673 line:15%
DANI: Oof.

3663
02:15:49.673 --> 02:15:50.830 line:15%
Wow.
Does that make sense?

3664
02:15:50.830 --> 02:15:52.960 line:15%
Sure, like if you saw Laura about

3665
02:15:52.960 --> 02:15:57.170
to trip into the street as a car was coming,

3666
02:15:57.170 --> 02:16:00.650
you grab her shirt, but if you saw some rando,

3667
02:16:00.650 --> 02:16:02.390
you'd be like he's kind of far away,

3668
02:16:02.390 --> 02:16:03.900
I don't think I'm going to make it in time.

3669
02:16:03.900 --> 02:16:06.360
I'll be one of those people that calls the police after.

3670
02:16:06.360 --> 02:16:08.360
Is that what you mean?

3671
02:16:08.360 --> 02:16:09.193
DANI: Wow.

3672
02:16:09.193 --> 02:16:10.250
BRIAN: Is that what you mean?

3673
02:16:10.250 --> 02:16:11.083
I mean--

3674
02:16:11.083 --> 02:16:12.470
Just to use a real-life example to ground it

3675
02:16:12.470 --> 02:16:13.513
for the folks at home.
It's hard to say yes

3676
02:16:13.513 --> 02:16:18.410
to that, but kind of, I guess.

3677
02:16:18.410 --> 02:16:19.243
I don't know.

3678
02:16:19.243 --> 02:16:23.430
Yeah, I think he is concerned about himself first.

3679
02:16:23.430 --> 02:16:25.850
Yeah, how much of the Might Nein's worry

3680
02:16:25.850 --> 02:16:27.560 line:15%
for Jester about the cultness

3681
02:16:27.560 --> 02:16:30.140 line:15%
of the Traveler gets through to her?

3682
02:16:30.140 --> 02:16:32.420 line:15%
Does she think any of their worries have a foundation,

3683
02:16:32.420 --> 02:16:35.660 line:15%
or does she think they're just well meaning but paranoid?

3684
02:16:35.660 --> 02:16:37.780
Like, she knows he's godly.

3685
02:16:38.860 --> 02:16:41.030
She knows how powerful she is.

3686
02:16:41.030 --> 02:16:43.640
I can't wait for Traveler Con!

3687
02:16:43.640 --> 02:16:44.473
I know.

3688
02:16:44.473 --> 02:16:47.250
There is a little bit of like, oh, that's weird,

3689
02:16:47.250 --> 02:16:52.010
like seeing how other gods interact with their constituents,

3690
02:16:52.010 --> 02:16:52.909
whatever you call it.
Mm-hmm.

3691
02:16:52.909 --> 02:16:54.950
(laughter)
Constituents, wow.

3692
02:16:56.320 --> 02:16:59.540
Hello, my constituent, I have heard your plea for help.

3693
02:16:59.540 --> 02:17:02.020
I am here to assist you.
The Traveler is a local,

3694
02:17:02.020 --> 02:17:03.560
small-town politician.

3695
02:17:04.710 --> 02:17:06.900
The other gods are all part of the United Nations,

3696
02:17:06.900 --> 02:17:09.100
and they're like, oh, you won with 30 votes?

3697
02:17:09.100 --> 02:17:10.650
That's adorable.

3698
02:17:10.650 --> 02:17:13.160
How does it feel to have a fictional family

3699
02:17:13.160 --> 02:17:15.300
that only acknowledges your accomplishments

3700
02:17:15.300 --> 02:17:19.530
while they undercut the true personhood behind it.

3701
02:17:19.530 --> 02:17:22.880
How does Beau differ now from the young woman in that house?

3702
02:17:22.880 --> 02:17:25.156 line:15%
Beau's, I think Beau's shown a lot of growth,

3703
02:17:25.156 --> 02:17:26.397 line:15%
like we're talking about.

3704
02:17:26.397 --> 02:17:29.220 line:15%
I hope so.

3705
02:17:29.220 --> 02:17:34.220 line:15%
The Mighty Nein has helped Beau trust in other people

3706
02:17:35.180 --> 02:17:38.382
around her and come out of her shell

3707
02:17:38.382 --> 02:17:43.010
and learn how to control her outbursts

3708
02:17:43.010 --> 02:17:45.270
and her blaming other people

3709
02:17:45.270 --> 02:17:46.337
and her anger.
And say thank you.

3710
02:17:46.337 --> 02:17:49.037
And say thank you and sorry.

3711
02:17:49.037 --> 02:17:50.798
Yeah, that's a big one.

3712
02:17:50.798 --> 02:17:51.970
(both laugh)

3713
02:17:51.970 --> 02:17:53.350
Good job.

3714
02:17:53.350 --> 02:17:54.183
That was good.
Thanks, life coach.

3715
02:17:54.183 --> 02:17:55.016
You earned it.

3716
02:17:55.016 --> 02:17:56.128
Still practicing.

3717
02:17:56.128 --> 02:17:57.090
LAURA: (laughs)

3718
02:17:57.090 --> 02:17:59.070
But yeah, like, what you were saying.

3719
02:17:59.070 --> 02:18:01.220
It was immediately all those

3720
02:18:01.220 --> 02:18:03.930
like bad thoughts were coming back.

3721
02:18:03.930 --> 02:18:08.930
So it felt like Beau was on the verge of reverting,

3722
02:18:09.030 --> 02:18:10.450
that the whole end of that game

3723
02:18:10.450 --> 02:18:11.450
and just, like, fighting it--
Nothing makes you

3724
02:18:11.450 --> 02:18:16.030
fucking regress to you childhood, like, mannerisms

3725
02:18:16.030 --> 02:18:18.050
and behaviors, faster than going home.

3726
02:18:18.050 --> 02:18:19.290
Oh my god.
Absolutely.

3727
02:18:19.290 --> 02:18:20.330
Yeah.
Absolutely.

3728
02:18:20.330 --> 02:18:22.170
When Marisha gets off the phone with her mom,

3729
02:18:22.170 --> 02:18:24.471
I can barely understand what the fuck she's saying.

3730
02:18:24.471 --> 02:18:27.680
It sounds like some backwood Irish accent,

3731
02:18:27.680 --> 02:18:29.020
but it's like--
It's so bad.

3732
02:18:29.020 --> 02:18:30.690
She's speaking Mountain Dew.

3733
02:18:30.690 --> 02:18:31.910
LAURA: No!

3734
02:18:31.910 --> 02:18:35.800
Jester seems okay and supportive of her mother's job,

3735
02:18:35.800 --> 02:18:37.810
which involves sleeping with numerous clients.

3736
02:18:37.810 --> 02:18:38.643
LAURA: Sure.

3737
02:18:38.643 --> 02:18:39.476
So does mine.

3738
02:18:39.476 --> 02:18:43.570
But she has shown strong distaste for her father sleeping

3739
02:18:43.570 --> 02:18:46.370 line:15%
with anyone since the parental discovery, why?

3740
02:18:46.370 --> 02:18:48.940 line:15%
No, no, no, no, that's inaccurate.

3741
02:18:48.940 --> 02:18:49.840 line:15%
BRIAN: Okay.

3742
02:18:49.840 --> 02:18:51.450 line:15%
I'm totally okay.

3743
02:18:51.450 --> 02:18:53.800 line:15%
If he wants to go get his kicks, whatever.

3744
02:18:53.800 --> 02:18:55.510 line:15%
He can go sleep with people.

3745
02:18:55.510 --> 02:18:58.870 line:15%
Also, she's okay with people paying to sleep

3746
02:18:58.870 --> 02:19:00.560 line:15%
with her mom, no big deal.

3747
02:19:00.560 --> 02:19:03.280 line:15%
However, what you didn't see is, all growing up,

3748
02:19:03.280 --> 02:19:06.950 line:15%
Jester fucking with everybody that her mom slept with,

3749
02:19:06.950 --> 02:19:08.300 line:15%
getting in trouble for it.

3750
02:19:08.300 --> 02:19:11.030 line:15%
She consistently gave her clients shit.

3751
02:19:12.220 --> 02:19:14.640 line:15%
Also, the only time she was unsupportive

3752
02:19:14.640 --> 02:19:17.150 line:15%
of it is when she saw the woman in the room,

3753
02:19:17.150 --> 02:19:19.930 line:15%
and then she was like, get the fuck out, right?

3754
02:19:19.930 --> 02:19:23.120 line:15%
So yeah, whatever, you can sleep with people.

3755
02:19:23.120 --> 02:19:26.110 line:15%
Don't form a fucking relationship with them, though.

3756
02:19:26.110 --> 02:19:27.920 line:15%
DANI: You can't stay for breakfast.

3757
02:19:27.920 --> 02:19:28.753 line:15%
Exactly.

3758
02:19:28.753 --> 02:19:29.650 line:15%
MARISHA: (laughs)
Yeah.

3759
02:19:29.650 --> 02:19:32.040 line:15%
Rickolas, nobody's named Rickolas.

3760
02:19:32.040 --> 02:19:34.340 line:15%
(laughter)

3761
02:19:34.340 --> 02:19:36.430 line:15%
Your name is either Rick or Nicholas.

3762
02:19:36.430 --> 02:19:37.990 line:15%
It's not Rickolas.

3763
02:19:37.990 --> 02:19:39.156 line:15%
That's ridickolas.

3764
02:19:39.156 --> 02:19:41.000 line:15%
MARISHA: (and Laura laughing)

3765
02:19:41.000 --> 02:19:44.440 line:15%
Rickolas Weishaupt wants to know (clicks),

3766
02:19:44.440 --> 02:19:46.440 line:15%
somebody should say that backwards.

3767
02:19:46.440 --> 02:19:47.273 line:15%
Maybe not.

3768
02:19:48.890 --> 02:19:50.930 line:15%
After--
Swoo--

3769
02:19:50.930 --> 02:19:51.840 line:15%
BRIAN: One more time.

3770
02:19:51.840 --> 02:19:53.943 line:15%
Putah, Putahsew Salackir.

3771
02:19:58.070 --> 02:20:00.144 line:15%
That's right.
Whoa.

3772
02:20:00.144 --> 02:20:01.910 line:15%
MARISHA: (laughs) John is dead.

3773
02:20:03.105 --> 02:20:04.080 line:15%
Yeah, I was going to say,

3774
02:20:04.080 --> 02:20:05.955 line:15%
somewhere, someone just fell over dead.

3775
02:20:05.955 --> 02:20:09.290 line:15%
(both laughing)

3776
02:20:09.290 --> 02:20:11.770
Somewhere, Taliesin just shot up and went,

3777
02:20:11.770 --> 02:20:13.330
mm, a fresh one.

3778
02:20:13.330 --> 02:20:16.134
(laughter)

3779
02:20:16.134 --> 02:20:19.134
(upbeat rock music)

3780
02:20:21.578 --> 02:20:23.610
(crowd cheers)
Woo-hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo!

3781
02:20:23.610 --> 02:20:25.650
Yeah, we did it, yeah!

3782
02:20:25.650 --> 02:20:27.940
DANI: Sam Riegel, you just won the Superbowl.

3783
02:20:27.940 --> 02:20:29.010
What are you going to do now?

3784
02:20:29.010 --> 02:20:32.080
I'm subscribing to Critical Role, yeah!

3785
02:20:32.080 --> 02:20:33.170
DANI: Wonderful, and that's--

3786
02:20:33.170 --> 02:20:35.420
It's about perseverance, like, remember

3787
02:20:35.420 --> 02:20:38.570
to resubscribe with Twitch Prime, every month, yeah!

3788
02:20:38.570 --> 02:20:39.403
Hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo!
Yes.

3789
02:20:39.403 --> 02:20:40.270
Well, could you--

3790
02:20:40.270 --> 02:20:41.650
Have done it without my teammates?

3791
02:20:41.650 --> 02:20:42.570
Come on, no way!

3792
02:20:42.570 --> 02:20:44.010
And they couldn't have done it

3793
02:20:44.010 --> 02:20:47.000
without the Twitch subscriptions that I gave them.

3794
02:20:47.000 --> 02:20:47.860
Right, guys?

3795
02:20:47.860 --> 02:20:48.950
Yeah!
Okay, Sam,

3796
02:20:48.950 --> 02:20:50.170
but what about the--

3797
02:20:50.170 --> 02:20:53.090
Oh, what about, what about inspires me, you mean?

3798
02:20:53.090 --> 02:20:55.130
Well, Yee-Haw Game Ranch really does.

3799
02:20:55.130 --> 02:20:57.370
I mean, watching that dehydrated piece

3800
02:20:57.370 --> 02:21:00.680
of string cheese Brian Foster, every couple of weeks,

3801
02:21:00.680 --> 02:21:02.902
really gets me pumped for the big game!

3802
02:21:02.902 --> 02:21:04.190
SAM: (laughs)
Sam, hold on.

3803
02:21:04.190 --> 02:21:05.270
We have to--
(horn wails)

3804
02:21:05.270 --> 02:21:06.650
You can't believe it?

3805
02:21:06.650 --> 02:21:08.110
You can't believe it, is that what you said?

3806
02:21:08.110 --> 02:21:09.170
Well, it's true,

3807
02:21:09.170 --> 02:21:12.500
because every Yee-Haw VOD is instantly available,

3808
02:21:12.500 --> 02:21:13.940
as soon as you subscribe.

3809
02:21:13.940 --> 02:21:15.120
It's amazing!
Sam!

3810
02:21:15.120 --> 02:21:16.380
We did it, guys.
Sam!

3811
02:21:16.380 --> 02:21:18.100
Yeah, yeah!
Sam!

3812
02:21:18.100 --> 02:21:19.090
Yeah, what, sorry.

3813
02:21:19.090 --> 02:21:21.490
DANI: Just say I'm going to Disneyland.

3814
02:21:21.490 --> 02:21:23.600
You're doing a commercial for Disneyland.

3815
02:21:23.600 --> 02:21:24.433
Oh, uh...

3816
02:21:28.290 --> 02:21:29.327
What's a Disneyland?

3817
02:21:29.327 --> 02:21:31.455 line:15%
(dramatic music)

3818
02:21:31.455 --> 02:21:34.288 line:15%
(whistle shrills)

3819
02:21:36.190 --> 02:21:37.023 line:15%
I don't know.

3820
02:21:37.023 --> 02:21:37.990
I got to be honest with you.

3821
02:21:37.990 --> 02:21:39.048
DANI: Oh!

3822
02:21:39.048 --> 02:21:41.660
I got hit in the head pretty hard out there.

3823
02:21:41.660 --> 02:21:42.612
DANI: Oh my god.

3824
02:21:42.612 --> 02:21:45.942
Woo, uh, I'm not good at sports.

3825
02:21:45.942 --> 02:21:48.936
SAM: (thuds)
(crowd gasps)

3826
02:21:48.936 --> 02:21:51.519
(crowd cheers)

3827
02:21:55.226 --> 02:21:58.393 line:15%
(dramatic folk music)

3828
02:34:40.600 --> 02:34:42.330
Hello, everyone, welcome back.

3829
02:34:42.330 --> 02:34:44.440
Before we jump into the next half of our session,

3830
02:34:44.440 --> 02:34:46.060
we do have one winner of our Wyrmwood giveaway.

3831
02:34:46.060 --> 02:34:49.580
The winner is SRVfan32688.

3832
02:34:49.580 --> 02:34:51.440
SAM: Woo, I love me some SRV!

3833
02:34:51.440 --> 02:34:54.870
Congratulations, SRVfan32688.

3834
02:34:54.870 --> 02:34:57.011
We'll get that sent to you ASAP.

3835
02:34:57.011 --> 02:34:58.057
LIAM: Move along.

3836
02:34:58.057 --> 02:35:00.060
(laughter)

3837
02:35:00.060 --> 02:35:00.893
All righty.

3838
02:35:01.840 --> 02:35:06.840
So as you guys have trekked your way up

3839
02:35:07.510 --> 02:35:10.100
towards the base of the mountain, looking through the mist,

3840
02:35:10.100 --> 02:35:13.290
you can see the rickety cabin-like abode

3841
02:35:13.290 --> 02:35:17.060
that rests before you, amongst the rocky

3842
02:35:17.060 --> 02:35:18.880
and forest-covered hill.

3843
02:35:20.080 --> 02:35:21.380
What would you like to do?

3844
02:35:23.920 --> 02:35:26.570
Should we rest now?

3845
02:35:27.600 --> 02:35:28.433
This is dumb.

3846
02:35:28.433 --> 02:35:30.050
It's dumb to rest right here, right?

3847
02:35:30.050 --> 02:35:32.010
In view of her shack?

3848
02:35:32.010 --> 02:35:33.990
Like, an actual rest?

3849
02:35:33.990 --> 02:35:35.640
Like, go to sleep in front of her house?

3850
02:35:35.640 --> 02:35:36.510
There's no way.
No way.

3851
02:35:36.510 --> 02:35:38.250
She's going to come up in the middle of the night

3852
02:35:38.250 --> 02:35:39.490
and kill us all.

3853
02:35:39.490 --> 02:35:41.890
How many feet, roughly, are we from this home?

3854
02:35:41.890 --> 02:35:43.355
You're about 60 or so feet.

3855
02:35:43.355 --> 02:35:45.380
(laughter)
Oh my god.

3856
02:35:45.380 --> 02:35:46.380
About 100 feet.

3857
02:35:46.380 --> 02:35:48.200
I start putting up the wire.

3858
02:35:48.200 --> 02:35:50.210
We'll say about 100 and so feet

3859
02:35:50.210 --> 02:35:52.370
before the mist reveals the shape,

3860
02:35:52.370 --> 02:35:53.850
and you begin to see what's ahead of you.

3861
02:35:53.850 --> 02:35:56.170
How about we split into two parties,

3862
02:35:56.170 --> 02:35:59.660
and we wrap around the house and meet on the backside?

3863
02:35:59.660 --> 02:36:00.493 line:15%
Do a scout?

3864
02:36:01.770 --> 02:36:02.800 line:15%
Why?

3865
02:36:02.800 --> 02:36:04.160 line:15%
To see what's around the house.

3866
02:36:04.160 --> 02:36:06.310 line:15%
Yeah, get the perimeters, man.

3867
02:36:06.310 --> 02:36:09.240 line:15%
Why don't we just send Frumpkin over there and see?

3868
02:36:09.240 --> 02:36:11.080 line:15%
Sure.
He can't see anything.

3869
02:36:11.080 --> 02:36:13.510 line:15%
That too, let's try that first.

3870
02:36:13.510 --> 02:36:15.270 line:15%
Well, I just don't want to separate,

3871
02:36:15.270 --> 02:36:18.590 line:15%
just because this lady's really powerful,

3872
02:36:18.590 --> 02:36:19.930 line:15%
and I have a feeling she'd--

3873
02:36:19.930 --> 02:36:20.880 line:15%
I think you have the right idea.

3874
02:36:20.880 --> 02:36:23.180 line:15%
I mean, we're not sending him to solve a mystery.

3875
02:36:23.180 --> 02:36:25.830 line:15%
We just want to see the other side of the home, yeah?

3876
02:36:26.926 --> 02:36:30.370 line:15%
LIAM: (whooshes)

3877
02:36:30.370 --> 02:36:33.080 line:15%
Frumpkin goes up and just starts to circle above the home.

3878
02:36:33.080 --> 02:36:34.610 line:15%
Okay, perception check from Frumpkin.

3879
02:36:34.610 --> 02:36:36.660 line:15%
Come on, you dumb, fucking cat-bird.

3880
02:36:36.660 --> 02:36:37.610 line:15%
Make it above a five.

3881
02:36:37.610 --> 02:36:38.443 line:15%
That's cocked, right?

3882
02:36:38.443 --> 02:36:39.690 line:15%
That is hella cocked.
It is cocked, yeah.

3883
02:36:39.690 --> 02:36:43.710 line:15%
Super cocked, super cocked, that's good for Frumpkin.

3884
02:36:43.710 --> 02:36:46.247 line:15%
Oh good job, Frumpy.
And that's a 15.

3885
02:36:46.247 --> 02:36:47.659 line:15%
Aw!
15.

3886
02:36:47.659 --> 02:36:48.651 line:15%
Best ever, yay.

3887
02:36:48.651 --> 02:36:50.620 line:15%
(laughter)

3888
02:36:50.620 --> 02:36:52.450 line:15%
Frumpkin does a pass of the area.

3889
02:36:52.450 --> 02:36:55.500 line:15%
You can see a number of the treetops around.

3890
02:36:55.500 --> 02:36:57.160 line:15%
There are trees in this area that

3891
02:36:57.160 --> 02:36:59.850 line:15%
aren't as closely knitted as a lot

3892
02:36:59.850 --> 02:37:03.420 line:15%
of the previous forest you've traversed, on your way here.

3893
02:37:03.420 --> 02:37:07.160 line:15%
You do see the little hut.

3894
02:37:07.160 --> 02:37:10.010 line:15%
You can see the remnants of a stone chimney.

3895
02:37:11.260 --> 02:37:13.980 line:15%
Frumpkin looks around and doesn't see anything moving

3896
02:37:13.980 --> 02:37:15.540 line:15%
on the outside, and from the back.

3897
02:37:15.540 --> 02:37:18.610 line:15%
There's a small barrel on one side

3898
02:37:18.610 --> 02:37:19.970 line:15%
of a cluster

3899
02:37:19.970 --> 02:37:24.690 line:15%
of small boxes, on the other.

3900
02:37:24.690 --> 02:37:26.450 line:15%
Beyond that (burps), pardon me,

3901
02:37:26.450 --> 02:37:29.380 line:15%
no signs of movement.
No movement of any kind.

3902
02:37:29.380 --> 02:37:31.570 line:15%
Did it look like there was a backdoor?

3903
02:37:31.570 --> 02:37:32.403 line:15%
Yeah.

3904
02:37:32.403 --> 02:37:33.380 line:15%
No backdoor.
No backdoor.

3905
02:37:33.380 --> 02:37:35.460 line:15%
Just the front entrance.
What the fuck are you doing?

3906
02:37:35.460 --> 02:37:36.982 line:15%
We're listening to Matt.

3907
02:37:36.982 --> 02:37:39.230 line:15%
(laughter)

3908
02:37:39.230 --> 02:37:40.842 line:15%
Good.

3909
02:37:40.842 --> 02:37:42.550 line:15%
We're about to die by hag.

3910
02:37:42.550 --> 02:37:44.750 line:15%
They're like the third row in the minivan,

3911
02:37:45.830 --> 02:37:47.220 line:15%
hella far back.

3912
02:37:47.220 --> 02:37:49.500 line:15%
Caleb can't hear anything, but he's muttering

3913
02:37:49.500 --> 02:37:51.480 line:15%
to Beauregard the things that he sees.

3914
02:37:51.480 --> 02:37:54.070 line:15%
Yeah, those boxes, I don't know what's in them.

3915
02:37:54.070 --> 02:37:55.020 line:15%
I don't see a door.

3916
02:37:55.970 --> 02:37:57.490 line:15%
This cat is good for something.

3917
02:37:57.490 --> 02:37:59.490 line:15%
This cat is a fucking shitbag.

3918
02:37:59.490 --> 02:38:01.660 line:15%
That cat is a bird.

3919
02:38:01.660 --> 02:38:03.000 line:15%
The cat sucks.

3920
02:38:03.000 --> 02:38:03.910 line:15%
Can he hear us?

3921
02:38:05.380 --> 02:38:06.220 line:15%
Can he hear us?

3922
02:38:06.220 --> 02:38:07.670 line:15%
I can't remember.
No, he can't.

3923
02:38:07.670 --> 02:38:09.409 line:15%
He's only there.

3924
02:38:09.409 --> 02:38:10.810 line:15%
He can feel if you tug.

3925
02:38:10.810 --> 02:38:12.262 line:15%
Yeah.
LAURA: (laughs)

3926
02:38:12.262 --> 02:38:13.706 line:15%
(laughter)

3927
02:38:13.706 --> 02:38:14.539 line:15%
I, I--

3928
02:38:14.539 --> 02:38:15.539 line:15%
I'm not as stoic as Caleb.

3929
02:38:15.539 --> 02:38:16.500 line:15%
(laughter)

3930
02:38:16.500 --> 02:38:17.350 line:15%
We're way safe.

3931
02:38:18.268 --> 02:38:20.768 line:15%
(laughter)

3932
02:38:26.423 --> 02:38:28.690 line:15%
(whooshes) Yeah, okay.

3933
02:38:28.690 --> 02:38:29.980 line:15%
Your cat's great.

3934
02:38:29.980 --> 02:38:31.110 line:15%
This is the best cat.

3935
02:38:31.110 --> 02:38:31.943 line:15%
Yeah.

3936
02:38:32.800 --> 02:38:33.633 line:15%
I wish he would come back.

3937
02:38:33.633 --> 02:38:35.040 line:15%
Did you find anything?

3938
02:38:35.040 --> 02:38:37.790 line:15%
Yeah, there's a back area

3939
02:38:37.790 --> 02:38:40.450 line:15%
and a bunch of shit piled up outside the door.

3940
02:38:40.450 --> 02:38:45.450 line:15%
There is no door, I'm sorry, piled up in the back.

3941
02:38:45.760 --> 02:38:47.850 line:15%
Was it walled in, in any way, when I looked back there,

3942
02:38:47.850 --> 02:38:49.110 line:15%
or was does it just keep stretching on

3943
02:38:49.110 --> 02:38:50.460 line:15%
into wilderness, behind it?

3944
02:38:51.380 --> 02:38:52.787 line:15%
It just continues on, into wilderness.

3945
02:38:52.787 --> 02:38:55.030 line:15%
Okay.

3946
02:38:55.030 --> 02:38:58.150 line:15%
So one entrance that we know of.

3947
02:38:58.150 --> 02:38:59.070 line:15%
Just the front door.

3948
02:38:59.070 --> 02:38:59.960 line:15%
What about windows?

3949
02:38:59.960 --> 02:39:01.700 line:15%
Were there windows?

3950
02:39:01.700 --> 02:39:03.070 line:15%
Were there windows?

3951
02:39:03.070 --> 02:39:05.050 line:15%
No windows, just the front entrance.

3952
02:39:05.050 --> 02:39:06.030 line:15%
No.

3953
02:39:06.030 --> 02:39:07.330 line:15%
That's a creepy house.

3954
02:39:07.330 --> 02:39:08.370 line:15%
Who would design a house

3955
02:39:08.370 --> 02:39:10.490 line:15%
without any windows or natural light?

3956
02:39:10.490 --> 02:39:11.610 line:15%
Probably a witch.

3957
02:39:12.560 --> 02:39:13.810 line:15%
We could just go knock.

3958
02:39:14.840 --> 02:39:16.420 line:15%
Yeah.

3959
02:39:16.420 --> 02:39:17.640 line:15%
I'm kind of into that.

3960
02:39:17.640 --> 02:39:19.140 line:15%
TRAVIS and TALIESIN: Yeah.

3961
02:39:19.140 --> 02:39:20.494 line:15%
Should we leave some people

3962
02:39:20.494 --> 02:39:23.050 line:15%
as a reserve, outside or something?

3963
02:39:23.050 --> 02:39:23.883 line:15%
Why?
No.

3964
02:39:23.883 --> 02:39:26.690 line:15%
If we all go in, we all go in.

3965
02:39:27.540 --> 02:39:28.373 line:15%
What?

3966
02:39:28.373 --> 02:39:30.420 line:15%
You know how Jester already said don't split the party?

3967
02:39:30.420 --> 02:39:31.632 line:15%
Yeah.

3968
02:39:31.632 --> 02:39:35.960 line:15%
I think any attempt at deceit would end poorly.

3969
02:39:35.960 --> 02:39:37.850 line:15%
This lady saw me scrying on her.

3970
02:39:37.850 --> 02:39:39.490 line:15%
She's, like, super observant.

3971
02:39:39.490 --> 02:39:42.290 line:15%
She's been watching our every move coming here, right?

3972
02:39:42.290 --> 02:39:43.670 line:15%
I'm assuming so.
She could watching us,

3973
02:39:43.670 --> 02:39:44.503 line:15%
right now.

3974
02:39:45.800 --> 02:39:46.633 line:15%
Hi!

3975
02:39:48.447 --> 02:39:50.210 line:15%
Are you just calling out, 60 feet away?

3976
02:39:50.210 --> 02:39:51.390 line:15%
Yeah.
It's 60 feet.

3977
02:39:51.390 --> 02:39:53.056 line:15%
How loud can you go?
100 feet.

3978
02:39:53.056 --> 02:39:53.980 line:15%
Hi.

3979
02:39:53.980 --> 02:39:55.560 line:15%
Louder!
What the fuck?

3980
02:39:55.560 --> 02:39:57.430 line:15%
She can probably hear.
She knows, right?

3981
02:39:57.430 --> 02:39:58.263 line:15%
That's true.

3982
02:39:58.263 --> 02:40:00.250 line:15%
Let's just walk.
You know?

3983
02:40:00.250 --> 02:40:01.083 line:15%
Do I hear anything?

3984
02:40:01.083 --> 02:40:01.970 line:15%
Do I feel anything?

3985
02:40:01.970 --> 02:40:04.770 line:15%
Do I feel special?
Make a perception check.

3986
02:40:04.770 --> 02:40:05.960 line:15%
Do I feel special?

3987
02:40:05.960 --> 02:40:07.867 line:15%
Well, you're a D&amp;D character,

3988
02:40:07.867 --> 02:40:08.700 line:15%
so yeah.
18.

3989
02:40:08.700 --> 02:40:09.980 line:15%
You feel very special.

3990
02:40:09.980 --> 02:40:10.870 line:15%
I feel very special?

3991
02:40:10.870 --> 02:40:12.226 line:15%
But you don't hear anything.

3992
02:40:12.226 --> 02:40:13.610 line:15%
MARISHA: (sighs)

3993
02:40:13.610 --> 02:40:14.443 line:15%
You're right.

3994
02:40:14.443 --> 02:40:15.276 line:15%
Yasha, shall we?

3995
02:40:16.450 --> 02:40:17.830 line:15%
Let's go.
All right.

3996
02:40:17.830 --> 02:40:19.948 line:15%
Yasha and I start walking up to the door.

3997
02:40:19.948 --> 02:40:22.710 line:15%
I follow.
I follow.

3998
02:40:22.710 --> 02:40:23.543 line:15%
Jester!

3999
02:40:23.543 --> 02:40:24.650 line:15%
Huh?
Come on!

4000
02:40:24.650 --> 02:40:25.500 line:15%
Okay.
Caleb!

4001
02:40:26.490 --> 02:40:29.660 line:15%
Caleb's double branches away from the group

4002
02:40:29.660 --> 02:40:32.340 line:15%
and goes to the corner of the house, to the side,

4003
02:40:32.340 --> 02:40:34.590 line:15%
and then just sort of stays at the front,

4004
02:40:34.590 --> 02:40:36.870 line:15%
peeking around the front,

4005
02:40:36.870 --> 02:40:38.106 line:15%
as the group goes up.
Nott.

4006
02:40:38.106 --> 02:40:39.013 line:15%
All right.

4007
02:40:39.013 --> 02:40:39.846 line:15%
What?

4008
02:40:39.846 --> 02:40:41.099 line:15%
Come on.

4009
02:40:41.099 --> 02:40:41.932 line:15%
We're all going.

4010
02:40:41.932 --> 02:40:42.850 line:15%
Are you going or no?
I'm going to go invisible.

4011
02:40:42.850 --> 02:40:44.230 line:15%
I'm going invisible.

4012
02:40:44.230 --> 02:40:45.810 line:15%
But she--
It's fine.

4013
02:40:45.810 --> 02:40:46.980 line:15%
She'll still be able to see you,

4014
02:40:46.980 --> 02:40:48.930 line:15%
but if you feel more comfortable, whatever.

4015
02:40:48.930 --> 02:40:50.530 line:15%
She can't do everything.

4016
02:40:50.530 --> 02:40:51.840 line:15%
She can see things like that.

4017
02:40:51.840 --> 02:40:52.700 line:15%
You don't know anything about her.

4018
02:40:52.700 --> 02:40:54.250 line:15%
I know!

4019
02:40:54.250 --> 02:40:55.190 line:15%
And Frumpkin is just circling.

4020
02:40:55.190 --> 02:40:56.990 line:15%
I'm doing this, but I'm invisible.

4021
02:40:58.120 --> 02:40:58.953 line:15%
We know.

4022
02:40:58.953 --> 02:40:59.910 line:15%
(laughter)

4023
02:40:59.910 --> 02:41:01.410 line:15%
Shit!

4024
02:41:01.410 --> 02:41:04.510 line:15%
So who's doing what then?

4025
02:41:04.510 --> 02:41:05.343 line:15%
You've...

4026
02:41:06.500 --> 02:41:07.570 line:15%
Smoothy McGee over here.

4027
02:41:07.570 --> 02:41:08.403 line:15%
They were firsties.

4028
02:41:08.403 --> 02:41:10.080 line:15%
Yasha and I are at the door.

4029
02:41:10.080 --> 02:41:10.960 line:15%
So you guys approach.

4030
02:41:10.960 --> 02:41:12.000 line:15%
It is a bit of a climb.

4031
02:41:12.000 --> 02:41:14.380 line:15%
There's a bit of a a rocky incline

4032
02:41:14.380 --> 02:41:19.130 line:15%
that you head up to the front of this small abode.

4033
02:41:19.130 --> 02:41:21.990 line:15%
The base of it, you see heavy roots emerging from it,

4034
02:41:21.990 --> 02:41:24.740 line:15%
like the house is rooted into the ground.

4035
02:41:27.450 --> 02:41:29.190 line:15%
Literally going to discuss you.

4036
02:41:29.190 --> 02:41:32.210 line:15%
I don't know how visibility is,

4037
02:41:32.210 --> 02:41:33.900 line:15%
your name is going to instantly come up.

4038
02:41:33.900 --> 02:41:35.490 line:15%
Ooh, the wind.
The two of you make

4039
02:41:35.490 --> 02:41:38.720 line:15%
your way up to the pouch, the pouch of the porch.

4040
02:41:38.720 --> 02:41:40.520 line:15%
Looking upon the porch in front of you,

4041
02:41:40.520 --> 02:41:42.860 line:15%
you can see the fronts lift about waist high,

4042
02:41:42.860 --> 02:41:44.520 line:15%
with these dividers.

4043
02:41:44.520 --> 02:41:47.350 line:15%
There's the opening on the inside, onto the porch.

4044
02:41:47.350 --> 02:41:49.750 line:15%
Then there is the partially ajar door

4045
02:41:49.750 --> 02:41:53.560 line:15%
and the warmly-lit interior of the hut.

4046
02:41:53.560 --> 02:41:56.530 line:15%
This is so stupid.
Open door.

4047
02:41:56.530 --> 02:41:58.260 line:15%
Knock or just open the door?

4048
02:41:58.260 --> 02:41:59.770 line:15%
We should knock.
Can you see in

4049
02:41:59.770 --> 02:42:00.825 line:15%
through the doorway?

4050
02:42:00.825 --> 02:42:01.658 line:15%
Yeah.

4051
02:42:01.658 --> 02:42:02.491 line:15%
It's open.

4052
02:42:03.600 --> 02:42:04.520 line:15%
But I feel like we shouldn't--

4053
02:42:04.520 --> 02:42:06.090 line:15%
Oh, there's no door?

4054
02:42:06.090 --> 02:42:07.670 line:15%
The door is there, but it's partially open.

4055
02:42:07.670 --> 02:42:08.510 line:15%
Oh, ooh.

4056
02:42:08.510 --> 02:42:09.810 line:15%
Yeah, we'll go up and...

4057
02:42:11.682 --> 02:42:13.646 line:15%
(knuckles rapping)

4058
02:42:13.646 --> 02:42:14.550 line:15%
Oh, you know what I should've done?

4059
02:42:14.550 --> 02:42:16.080 line:15%
You knock on the partially ajar door,

4060
02:42:16.080 --> 02:42:19.040 line:15%
and it (squeaks) opens, ever so slightly more,

4061
02:42:19.040 --> 02:42:21.390 line:15%
and you can see a little bit, in the inside.

4062
02:42:22.665 --> 02:42:24.910 line:15%
The house appears to be empty, or at the very least,

4063
02:42:24.910 --> 02:42:26.370 line:15%
there's nobody inside of it.

4064
02:42:28.110 --> 02:42:33.110 line:15%
Within, you can see the inside's both warm and muggy.

4065
02:42:33.830 --> 02:42:35.150 line:15%
The smell intensely reminiscent

4066
02:42:35.150 --> 02:42:37.660 line:15%
of strong mildew and herbs, almost.

4067
02:42:38.910 --> 02:42:40.890 line:15%
It's not too terribly large.

4068
02:42:40.890 --> 02:42:41.723 line:15%
Now that you've gotten close to it,

4069
02:42:41.723 --> 02:42:45.160 line:15%
you can see it's about 18 or so feet, end to end,

4070
02:42:45.160 --> 02:42:50.160 line:15%
maybe 20 or so feet, and about 15 feet wide or deep.

4071
02:42:51.290 --> 02:42:52.970 line:15%
From what you can see, there's a table

4072
02:42:52.970 --> 02:42:55.210 line:15%
in the middle of the room that has a lantern,

4073
02:42:55.210 --> 02:42:56.480 line:15%
a single lantern, on it, that's glowing,

4074
02:42:56.480 --> 02:42:59.000 line:15%
and it's where the light source is emanating from.

4075
02:42:59.000 --> 02:43:02.160 line:15%
There are a smattering of all sort of strange collectibles

4076
02:43:02.160 --> 02:43:05.160 line:15%
and piles in the corner, just shoved inside,

4077
02:43:05.160 --> 02:43:08.390 line:15%
chaotically organized, intently placed,

4078
02:43:08.390 --> 02:43:10.620 line:15%
but in a somewhat messy way.

4079
02:43:11.930 --> 02:43:14.970 line:15%
Kind of glancing along the ceiling on the inside,

4080
02:43:14.970 --> 02:43:17.520 line:15%
between where the wooden boards hold up the thatch,

4081
02:43:18.730 --> 02:43:22.880 line:15%
you can see hanging from chains and rope and twine,

4082
02:43:22.880 --> 02:43:27.090 line:15%
cages of different sizes, all dangling.

4083
02:43:27.090 --> 02:43:29.760 line:15%
The largest, they're about that big.

4084
02:43:29.760 --> 02:43:33.820 line:15%
Some are smaller, and they're carried at different heights.

4085
02:43:33.820 --> 02:43:35.970 line:15%
She's going to shrink us down and put us in cages.

4086
02:43:35.970 --> 02:43:36.803 line:15%
I can tell.
She's a trapper.

4087
02:43:36.803 --> 02:43:39.130 line:15%
I'll cast See Invisibility.

4088
02:43:39.130 --> 02:43:40.474 line:15%
Cast See Invisibility?
Oh, good call, yes!

4089
02:43:40.474 --> 02:43:41.740 line:15%
Okay.

4090
02:43:41.740 --> 02:43:46.370 line:15%
You cast See Invisibility, and you look inside the home.

4091
02:43:47.520 --> 02:43:48.353 line:15%
You don't see anything.

4092
02:43:48.353 --> 02:43:49.670 line:15%
She doesn't appear to be home.

4093
02:43:49.670 --> 02:43:51.200 line:15%
We certainly don't want to be in her house

4094
02:43:51.200 --> 02:43:52.560 line:15%
when she comes home.

4095
02:43:52.560 --> 02:43:54.260 line:15%
Does someone want to come in and investigate quicker,

4096
02:43:54.260 --> 02:43:56.730 line:15%
while the rest of us wait out front?

4097
02:43:56.730 --> 02:43:59.370 line:15%
Oh fuck, okay.
Go.

4098
02:43:59.370 --> 02:44:01.720 line:15%
Okay.
Nott, I'll do a quick scan.

4099
02:44:01.720 --> 02:44:03.160 line:15%
Nott, you take left.

4100
02:44:03.160 --> 02:44:03.993 line:15%
I'll take right.

4101
02:44:03.993 --> 02:44:05.590 line:15%
We will all step out, except for Nott and Beau.

4102
02:44:05.590 --> 02:44:07.520 line:15%
But we'll stand in front of the door.

4103
02:44:07.520 --> 02:44:08.570 line:15%
On the ground, yeah,

4104
02:44:08.570 --> 02:44:10.920 line:15%
and off the porch.
I do a quick like--

4105
02:44:10.920 --> 02:44:12.470 line:15%
Okay, so you guys are all stepping off the porch

4106
02:44:12.470 --> 02:44:14.360 line:15%
and staying away, while they're going inside?

4107
02:44:14.360 --> 02:44:15.900 line:15%
Okay, so Beau and Nott--

4108
02:44:15.900 --> 02:44:17.160 line:15%
Shouldn't we check for traps or anything, first?

4109
02:44:17.160 --> 02:44:17.993 line:15%
That makes me nervous.
I don't know

4110
02:44:17.993 --> 02:44:19.350 line:15%
if we have time.
Okay.

4111
02:44:19.350 --> 02:44:22.480 line:15%
I'm going to stand between, in the threshold.

4112
02:44:22.480 --> 02:44:23.313 line:15%
Okay, so you stand

4113
02:44:23.313 --> 02:44:24.360 line:15%
in the threshold of the room.

4114
02:44:24.360 --> 02:44:25.970 line:15%
I'm going to stick my head in really quick

4115
02:44:25.970 --> 02:44:27.090 line:15%
and cast Detect Magic.

4116
02:44:27.970 --> 02:44:28.820 line:15%
Wow.

4117
02:44:28.820 --> 02:44:32.340 line:15%
Okay, well, let's handle this one at a time here.

4118
02:44:32.340 --> 02:44:35.180 line:15%
So you guys enter the room and start investigating.

4119
02:44:35.180 --> 02:44:36.280 line:15%
You cast Detect Magic.

4120
02:44:38.220 --> 02:44:42.670 line:15%
You sense a number of faint magical auras.

4121
02:44:42.670 --> 02:44:43.503 line:15%
Sure.

4122
02:44:43.503 --> 02:44:45.730 line:15%
Kind of up in the roof region.

4123
02:44:47.513 --> 02:44:50.860 line:15%
I think a handful of things and what you can see on a shelf.

4124
02:44:50.860 --> 02:44:51.980 line:15%
As you go through the door

4125
02:44:51.980 --> 02:44:52.980 line:15%
and look on the opposite side of the door,

4126
02:44:52.980 --> 02:44:54.630 line:15%
as you guys investigate as well,

4127
02:44:54.630 --> 02:44:56.900 line:15%
there are two shelves that are just lined

4128
02:44:56.900 --> 02:45:00.900 line:15%
with all manner of jars, all different sizes.

4129
02:45:00.900 --> 02:45:04.030 line:15%
Some of them have bits of rope tied to the top

4130
02:45:04.030 --> 02:45:06.050 line:15%
with some sort of rubber-like substance capping the top.

4131
02:45:06.050 --> 02:45:07.350 line:15%
Some are sealed shut.

4132
02:45:07.350 --> 02:45:09.510 line:15%
Some, there's leather wrapped around it,

4133
02:45:09.510 --> 02:45:11.510 line:15%
and they are different colors and colorations.

4134
02:45:11.510 --> 02:45:13.010 line:15%
Some are just different colored glass.

4135
02:45:13.010 --> 02:45:14.410 line:15%
Some are stained from the inside

4136
02:45:14.410 --> 02:45:15.820 line:15%
of whatever they're containing.

4137
02:45:15.820 --> 02:45:18.380 line:15%
But there are dozens and dozens of this strange collection

4138
02:45:18.380 --> 02:45:20.320 line:15%
of all sorts of things.

4139
02:45:22.895 --> 02:45:24.530 line:15%
So that's what you detect in the vicinity.

4140
02:45:24.530 --> 02:45:26.280 line:15%
Gotcha.
Bits and pieces of it.

4141
02:45:26.280 --> 02:45:27.328 line:15%
All right, back out.

4142
02:45:27.328 --> 02:45:28.620 line:15%
SAM: (sighs)

4143
02:45:28.620 --> 02:45:30.540 line:15%
The rest of you guys are outside?

4144
02:45:30.540 --> 02:45:31.373 line:15%
Mm-hmm.

4145
02:45:31.373 --> 02:45:33.720 line:15%
Okay, what are you guys investigating?

4146
02:45:33.720 --> 02:45:36.050 line:15%
You said those jars are on the left or the right or both?

4147
02:45:36.050 --> 02:45:37.170 line:15%
They're both on the left-hand side,

4148
02:45:37.170 --> 02:45:38.360 line:15%
against the wall, in the back.

4149
02:45:38.360 --> 02:45:39.210 line:15%
That's my side.

4150
02:45:40.480 --> 02:45:41.967 line:15%
Shit (laughs).

4151
02:45:41.967 --> 02:45:43.250 line:15%
I can't help you.
I'm going to go for those jars

4152
02:45:43.250 --> 02:45:44.350 line:15%
and investigate them.

4153
02:45:44.350 --> 02:45:47.380 line:15%
Roll an investigation check.

4154
02:45:47.380 --> 02:45:49.980 line:15%
I will use my Reliable Talent.

4155
02:45:49.980 --> 02:45:52.160 line:15%
Oh wait, this is a disadvantage roll.

4156
02:45:52.160 --> 02:45:57.160 line:15%
Yes, I will still use my Reliable Talent to get a 21.

4157
02:45:57.710 --> 02:45:58.543 line:15%
Yeah, okay.

4158
02:45:59.760 --> 02:46:01.850 line:15%
There's nothing hidden on this side of the room.

4159
02:46:01.850 --> 02:46:06.170 line:15%
It's just a bit cluttered, but you have all of these jars

4160
02:46:06.170 --> 02:46:09.750 line:15%
and small glass objects that contain all manner of things,

4161
02:46:09.750 --> 02:46:12.100 line:15%
as well as the cages, as you look around.

4162
02:46:12.100 --> 02:46:14.940 line:15%
Within the jars, there are all sorts of herbs and materials.

4163
02:46:14.940 --> 02:46:18.320 line:15%
You, as an alchemist, would recognize a few of them,

4164
02:46:18.320 --> 02:46:19.230 line:15%
without even having to roll.

4165
02:46:19.230 --> 02:46:20.063 line:15%
There's mugwort.

4166
02:46:20.063 --> 02:46:20.896 line:15%
There's wormwood.

4167
02:46:20.896 --> 02:46:21.729 line:15%
There's blackroot.

4168
02:46:21.729 --> 02:46:23.810 line:15%
There's a little bit of powdered silver in a small pouch.

4169
02:46:23.810 --> 02:46:26.520 line:15%
You can see there's hindergale and gallerine mushroom

4170
02:46:26.520 --> 02:46:29.250 line:15%
and a collection of snake venom in one.

4171
02:46:29.250 --> 02:46:32.180 line:15%
There's a gnarled hand in one jar

4172
02:46:32.180 --> 02:46:35.040 line:15%
that's gray and withered, and it's kept in a liquid,

4173
02:46:35.040 --> 02:46:36.190 line:15%
that just shakes.

4174
02:46:37.980 --> 02:46:42.040 line:15%
You can see, up in the cages above, there are creatures

4175
02:46:42.040 --> 02:46:45.060 line:15%
that kind, you hear shift in one of the cages,

4176
02:46:45.060 --> 02:46:46.590 line:15%
and you glance up, and you can see

4177
02:46:46.590 --> 02:46:48.470 line:15%
a bat of some kind.

4178
02:46:48.470 --> 02:46:50.870 line:15%
It's hanging in one cage, upside down.

4179
02:46:50.870 --> 02:46:52.050 line:15%
You can see another one there.

4180
02:46:52.050 --> 02:46:55.170 line:15%
There's a hint of a blue tail of a lizard that's poking out.

4181
02:46:55.170 --> 02:46:57.590 line:15%
So there are creatures up in those cages,

4182
02:46:57.590 --> 02:46:58.910 line:15%
but you don't have quite the full vantage point.

4183
02:46:58.910 --> 02:47:00.910 line:15%
You just noticed a few of them in there.

4184
02:47:02.700 --> 02:47:03.760 line:15%
Okay.
Beauregard?

4185
02:47:03.760 --> 02:47:05.510 line:15%
I'll just whisper over to Beauregard,

4186
02:47:05.510 --> 02:47:08.640 line:15%
some animals and some magic components.

4187
02:47:08.640 --> 02:47:09.473 line:15%
That's it.

4188
02:47:10.650 --> 02:47:11.520 line:15%
What you got?

4189
02:47:11.520 --> 02:47:13.040 line:15%
I'm looking

4190
02:47:15.343 --> 02:47:16.176 line:15%
with disadvantage, right?

4191
02:47:17.520 --> 02:47:18.353 line:15%
Mm-hmm.

4192
02:47:18.353 --> 02:47:19.770 line:15%
24.
Oh, damn.

4193
02:47:19.770 --> 02:47:22.020 line:15%
24, okay, you guys are good.

4194
02:47:23.050 --> 02:47:24.880 line:15%
Glancing on the opposite end, looking at the table,

4195
02:47:24.880 --> 02:47:26.940 line:15%
you can see the table has been recently cleared,

4196
02:47:26.940 --> 02:47:28.680 line:15%
other than the lantern that's set there in the middle

4197
02:47:28.680 --> 02:47:30.310 line:15%
that's lighting the room.

4198
02:47:30.310 --> 02:47:33.140 line:15%
There are stains across the front of the table itself

4199
02:47:33.140 --> 02:47:37.450 line:15%
where various brackish liquids have been spilled and left

4200
02:47:37.450 --> 02:47:39.810 line:15%
to sit in and that's how it stained the wood on top.

4201
02:47:39.810 --> 02:47:40.780 line:15%
There are grooves

4202
02:47:40.780 --> 02:47:42.310 line:15%
and scratches across it, all different sizes

4203
02:47:42.310 --> 02:47:43.143 line:15%
and lengths.
It was 23.

4204
02:47:43.143 --> 02:47:44.370 line:15%
I feel so compelled to be honest.

4205
02:47:44.370 --> 02:47:45.330 line:15%
It was 23.

4206
02:47:45.330 --> 02:47:46.163 line:15%
Sorry, keep going.

4207
02:47:46.163 --> 02:47:47.220 line:15%
Okay, no worries.

4208
02:47:47.220 --> 02:47:48.655 line:15%
Keep going.

4209
02:47:48.655 --> 02:47:50.290 line:15%
It's not going to be a huge difference, it's fine.

4210
02:47:50.290 --> 02:47:52.840 line:15%
But you do notice that it looks like things were moved

4211
02:47:52.840 --> 02:47:55.150 line:15%
from here recently.

4212
02:47:55.150 --> 02:47:57.820 line:15%
You can see areas where dust had gathered,

4213
02:47:57.820 --> 02:48:00.770 line:15%
and things were placed in areas of that corner of the room,

4214
02:48:02.910 --> 02:48:04.620 line:15%
where there are circles in different shapes,

4215
02:48:04.620 --> 02:48:07.230 line:15%
on the ground and on another shelf,

4216
02:48:07.230 --> 02:48:09.470 line:15%
that the dust is not there.

4217
02:48:09.470 --> 02:48:12.900 line:15%
So some things have been moved.

4218
02:48:12.900 --> 02:48:16.500 line:15%
You also see all manner of small wooden platforms

4219
02:48:16.500 --> 02:48:18.700 line:15%
that emerge from parts of the wood that have melted wax,

4220
02:48:18.700 --> 02:48:22.210 line:15%
just dripping down the sides, like candles over time

4221
02:48:22.210 --> 02:48:23.930 line:15%
that have been replaced, replaced and replaced.

4222
02:48:23.930 --> 02:48:26.410 line:15%
Looking around the side, there's dozens

4223
02:48:26.410 --> 02:48:30.170 line:15%
and dozens of these long, slowly building on themselves,

4224
02:48:30.170 --> 02:48:33.900 line:15%
frozen waterfalls of wax that drip down the walls,

4225
02:48:33.900 --> 02:48:36.300 line:15%
probably about 14 or so of these throughout the room,

4226
02:48:36.300 --> 02:48:38.050 line:15%
at different heights and locations.

4227
02:48:39.440 --> 02:48:40.780 line:15%
You were too focused on the jars

4228
02:48:40.780 --> 02:48:42.270 line:15%
to notice them originally, but you both

4229
02:48:42.270 --> 02:48:45.080 line:15%
see it's surrounding the entire interior chamber.

4230
02:48:45.080 --> 02:48:47.230 line:15%
Is there anything on the ground in there?

4231
02:48:49.903 --> 02:48:50.880 line:15%
Dirt of any sort?

4232
02:48:50.880 --> 02:48:52.450 line:15%
Normal stuff, I mean, yeah,

4233
02:48:52.450 --> 02:48:54.180 line:15%
take a look.
Anything on the ground?

4234
02:48:54.180 --> 02:48:57.320 line:15%
Can we assist each other as we both crawl to the middle?

4235
02:48:57.320 --> 02:48:59.180 line:15%
Yeah, you looked underneath the table.

4236
02:48:59.180 --> 02:49:00.720 line:15%
It's pretty clear beneath the table.

4237
02:49:00.720 --> 02:49:03.090 line:15%
Yes, and it looks like some things have been removed

4238
02:49:03.090 --> 02:49:05.000 line:15%
from and placed in--

4239
02:49:05.000 --> 02:49:06.350 line:15%
She just grabbed stuff recently.

4240
02:49:06.350 --> 02:49:07.220 line:15%
While they're doing that,

4241
02:49:07.220 --> 02:49:09.000 line:15%
can we check the treeline outside?

4242
02:49:09.000 --> 02:49:10.120 line:15%
Sure.
Yeah, keeping an eye out.

4243
02:49:10.120 --> 02:49:12.280 line:15%
Yeah.
Frumpkin's circling.

4244
02:49:12.280 --> 02:49:13.940 line:15%
So it's getting dark now.

4245
02:49:13.940 --> 02:49:15.240 line:15%
Dusk is hitting.

4246
02:49:15.240 --> 02:49:16.540 line:15%
There's a bit of a sunset.

4247
02:49:17.734 --> 02:49:19.280 line:15%
While you still have a cloudy sky,

4248
02:49:19.280 --> 02:49:21.660 line:15%
you can see the coloration shifting a little more

4249
02:49:21.660 --> 02:49:23.890 line:15%
to a purple, and it is getting visibly darker.

4250
02:49:23.890 --> 02:49:28.260 line:15%
So you probably have another (sighs) 20 or so minutes,

4251
02:49:28.260 --> 02:49:30.280 line:15%
before you start really losing light.

4252
02:49:31.800 --> 02:49:33.850 line:15%
As you guys walk out past the porch

4253
02:49:33.850 --> 02:49:36.700 line:15%
and head down the pathway and look over the treeline,

4254
02:49:36.700 --> 02:49:41.700 line:15%
Fjord, as you glance back towards the house, you see,

4255
02:49:42.630 --> 02:49:46.350 line:15%
on the roof, crouched and looming over the front of it,

4256
02:49:46.350 --> 02:49:50.650 line:15%
arms trailing, cloak and hood up, perched,

4257
02:49:51.650 --> 02:49:55.670 line:15%
a massive female humanoid form

4258
02:49:56.650 --> 02:49:59.410 line:15%
that has just knees up beneath the robe,

4259
02:50:00.560 --> 02:50:03.890 line:15%
weird, unnaturally long arms curled over the edge,

4260
02:50:03.890 --> 02:50:07.050 line:15%
just sitting and smiling and watching.

4261
02:50:10.380 --> 02:50:11.213 line:15%
All right,

4262
02:50:12.904 --> 02:50:15.310 line:15%
(coughs) Isharnai!

4263
02:50:16.630 --> 02:50:20.330 line:15%
The creature's arms unfurl a bit and grab.

4264
02:50:20.330 --> 02:50:21.654 line:15%
Make a perception check.

4265
02:50:21.654 --> 02:50:23.902 line:15%
LAURA: (groans)

4266
02:50:23.902 --> 02:50:25.430 line:15%
Oh no.

4267
02:50:25.430 --> 02:50:26.730 line:15%
11.
11.

4268
02:50:29.280 --> 02:50:33.400 line:15%
As the arms move back and grasp the front edges

4269
02:50:33.400 --> 02:50:38.060 line:15%
of the roof, there's something very unnatural

4270
02:50:38.060 --> 02:50:38.980 line:15%
in the way the arms--

4271
02:50:38.980 --> 02:50:42.290 line:15%
like each arm has two elbows, where it seems

4272
02:50:42.290 --> 02:50:44.940 line:15%
to bend and then unbend, as it grabs.

4273
02:50:44.940 --> 02:50:46.450 line:15%
Do I see her yet?

4274
02:50:46.450 --> 02:50:48.150 line:15%
Nope, none of you see her.

4275
02:50:48.150 --> 02:50:49.550 line:15%
Well, I was with Fjord.

4276
02:50:49.550 --> 02:50:50.400 line:15%
Right.

4277
02:50:50.400 --> 02:50:51.233 line:15%
Whoa.

4278
02:50:51.233 --> 02:50:52.640 line:15%
You see Fjord say this--

4279
02:50:52.640 --> 02:50:54.140 line:15%
To something in the air.

4280
02:50:55.862 --> 02:50:57.460 line:15%
She's invisible.

4281
02:50:57.460 --> 02:50:59.030 line:15%
As soon as you said that name,

4282
02:50:59.030 --> 02:51:02.540 line:15%
the head (hisses) looks right to you.

4283
02:51:02.540 --> 02:51:06.270 line:15%
You can see from the tattered lengths of black, oily hair

4284
02:51:06.270 --> 02:51:08.810 line:15%
that spill from underneath the hood

4285
02:51:08.810 --> 02:51:11.030 line:15%
and the long, pointed jaw

4286
02:51:11.030 --> 02:51:14.260 line:15%
where the jowls hang a bit, at the back,

4287
02:51:15.110 --> 02:51:17.990 line:15%
but the high cheekbones pull

4288
02:51:17.990 --> 02:51:20.670 line:15%
in an almost mockery of elvish features.

4289
02:51:20.670 --> 02:51:22.860 line:15%
The deep-set green eyes almost glowing

4290
02:51:22.860 --> 02:51:25.660 line:15%
from within the shaded hood, piercing right towards you.

4291
02:51:27.034 --> 02:51:28.430 line:15%
Mm, mm-mm.

4292
02:51:28.430 --> 02:51:30.460 line:15%
We come seeking a conversation.

4293
02:51:31.750 --> 02:51:32.670 line:15%
Would you say that she looks

4294
02:51:32.670 --> 02:51:34.601 line:15%
like the Ring girl, only old?

4295
02:51:34.601 --> 02:51:37.490 line:15%
MATT: (laughs)

4296
02:51:37.490 --> 02:51:39.650 line:15%
Old, swollen and six-foot-five, hunched.

4297
02:51:39.650 --> 02:51:40.483 line:15%
Sweet.

4298
02:51:43.560 --> 02:51:45.630 line:15%
Interesting.

4299
02:51:45.630 --> 02:51:46.463 line:15%
Oh boy.

4300
02:51:47.650 --> 02:51:50.010 line:15%
You all hear this now.

4301
02:51:50.010 --> 02:51:52.690 line:15%
While she speaks, it's almost vibrating

4302
02:51:52.690 --> 02:51:55.110 line:15%
around you, sourcelessly.

4303
02:51:55.110 --> 02:51:55.943 line:15%
Even within the house,

4304
02:51:55.943 --> 02:51:58.000 line:15%
it feels like it's coming from the walls,

4305
02:51:58.000 --> 02:51:58.890 line:15%
but you all turn,

4306
02:51:58.890 --> 02:52:00.320 line:15%
and you can sense the source a bit,

4307
02:52:00.320 --> 02:52:03.350 line:15%
coming from the house, but you cannot see anything.

4308
02:52:03.350 --> 02:52:08.350 line:15%
Which of you visited me from afar, these past days?

4309
02:52:11.280 --> 02:52:16.147 line:15%
I would like to see the face that held the prying eye.

4310
02:52:22.240 --> 02:52:24.167 line:15%
Are you guys actually going to look at me like that?

4311
02:52:24.167 --> 02:52:27.062 line:15%
Are you looking at me?

4312
02:52:27.062 --> 02:52:27.895 line:15%
Gulp.

4313
02:52:27.895 --> 02:52:30.395 line:15%
(laughter)

4314
02:52:41.080 --> 02:52:46.080 line:15%
What you guys see is suddenly there is a cracking shift

4315
02:52:47.170 --> 02:52:49.940 line:15%
of wood and thatch, and you see dust

4316
02:52:49.940 --> 02:52:51.700 line:15%
and moss fall from the roof,

4317
02:52:51.700 --> 02:52:55.580 line:15%
as you watch her (whoosh) leap into the air.

4318
02:52:56.470 --> 02:52:57.990 line:15%
You feel on the ground next to you,

4319
02:52:57.990 --> 02:53:00.430 line:15%
as dust, poof, dissipates out,

4320
02:53:01.730 --> 02:53:04.190 line:15%
you sense a presence, immediately to your left.

4321
02:53:04.190 --> 02:53:07.170 line:15%
You watch her leap 15 feet in the air,

4322
02:53:07.170 --> 02:53:10.390 line:15%
and with an impact, slam into the ground next to Jester

4323
02:53:10.390 --> 02:53:13.050 line:15%
and then come back to her full hunched height,

4324
02:53:13.050 --> 02:53:13.980 line:15%
looming over her.

4325
02:53:13.980 --> 02:53:15.280 line:15%
What's her posture like?

4326
02:53:17.636 --> 02:53:18.940 line:15%
From the robes that you can tell,

4327
02:53:18.940 --> 02:53:22.630 line:15%
and there are a number of, from what you can see close-up,

4328
02:53:22.630 --> 02:53:25.720 line:15%
the gray-brown coloring of the stained cloak

4329
02:53:25.720 --> 02:53:29.040 line:15%
that goes over the darker beneath robes,

4330
02:53:29.040 --> 02:53:30.410 line:15%
there's ratty gold twine

4331
02:53:30.410 --> 02:53:32.110 line:15%
that's wrapped around parts of the arms,

4332
02:53:32.110 --> 02:53:33.570 line:15%
and the wrists holding it

4333
02:53:33.570 --> 02:53:34.960 line:15%
and clutching it in places, to the body,

4334
02:53:34.960 --> 02:53:36.160 line:15%
and crossing around the chest,

4335
02:53:36.160 --> 02:53:38.880 line:15%
like it's holding the billowing robe close

4336
02:53:38.880 --> 02:53:40.510 line:15%
to the form for movement.

4337
02:53:43.590 --> 02:53:46.900 line:15%
The body is curved backward

4338
02:53:46.900 --> 02:53:49.870 line:15%
in an S-formation, where the front

4339
02:53:49.870 --> 02:53:52.880 line:15%
of the torso pulls back like a serpent,

4340
02:53:52.880 --> 02:53:55.330 line:15%
and then the shoulders slouch forward,

4341
02:53:55.330 --> 02:53:57.230 line:15%
and the head emerges from the shoulders

4342
02:53:57.230 --> 02:53:59.790 line:15%
in the center in a very heavy hunch,

4343
02:53:59.790 --> 02:54:03.350 line:15%
and even in that form, stands about 6 1/2 feet tall.

4344
02:54:03.350 --> 02:54:04.450 line:15%
You imagine if she were able

4345
02:54:04.450 --> 02:54:07.030 line:15%
to stand straight would be pushing probably 7 1/2 feet.

4346
02:54:07.030 --> 02:54:08.970 line:15%
Great.
I'll say her name again

4347
02:54:08.970 --> 02:54:11.300 line:15%
and look very directly in her direction and say,

4348
02:54:11.300 --> 02:54:14.450 line:15%
Isharnai, we've done much to seek an audience with you.

4349
02:54:15.910 --> 02:54:19.620 line:15%
We hope we might be able to converse peacefully.

4350
02:54:20.621 --> 02:54:25.621 line:15%
(sniffs) You can hear the loud sniffing sound

4351
02:54:25.670 --> 02:54:29.848 line:15%
and the warmth of breath on your cheek, Jester.

4352
02:54:29.848 --> 02:54:32.030 line:15%
She's right beside me.

4353
02:54:32.030 --> 02:54:35.140 line:15%
Then takes a step back and another step back,

4354
02:54:35.140 --> 02:54:37.360 line:15%
towards the house a bit,

4355
02:54:37.360 --> 02:54:40.370 line:15%
getting between you and the house,

4356
02:54:40.370 --> 02:54:41.970 line:15%
but still back towards the trees.

4357
02:54:41.970 --> 02:54:44.030 line:15%
There's nobody behind her.

4358
02:54:44.030 --> 02:54:46.880 line:15%
As the invisibility fades, and the rest of you begin

4359
02:54:46.880 --> 02:54:50.960 line:15%
to now see the physical form of Isharnai there

4360
02:54:50.960 --> 02:54:54.690 line:15%
and the fading light of the late afternoon.

4361
02:54:55.840 --> 02:55:00.527 line:15%
It is rare to have so many visitors (snarls),

4362
02:55:03.440 --> 02:55:07.650 line:15%
let alone all at once, at my home.

4363
02:55:13.120 --> 02:55:16.520 line:15%
You come here, survive the trial of the trek,

4364
02:55:18.470 --> 02:55:21.050 line:15%
and I assume it's because you're driven

4365
02:55:21.050 --> 02:55:24.940 line:15%
by the need for strong answers, yes?

4366
02:55:28.690 --> 02:55:31.110 line:15%
What is it that drives you then?

4367
02:55:31.110 --> 02:55:35.740 line:15%
Come, come, we can talk, one at a time.

4368
02:55:38.187 --> 02:55:39.110 line:15%
One at a time?

4369
02:55:40.367 --> 02:55:42.017 line:15%
That's some sweeping horseshit.

4370
02:55:44.550 --> 02:55:46.090 line:15%
Those of you who are inside the house,

4371
02:55:46.090 --> 02:55:47.068 line:15%
as you're glancing through

4372
02:55:47.068 --> 02:55:50.560 line:15%
and seeing the head (clicks) darts

4373
02:55:50.560 --> 02:55:52.130 line:15%
in an unnatural speed in your direction,

4374
02:55:52.130 --> 02:55:53.580 line:15%
and the arm emerges and goes.

4375
02:55:54.590 --> 02:55:57.261 line:15%
I just grab Nott by the hand.

4376
02:55:57.261 --> 02:55:59.844 line:15%
SAM: (whimpers)

4377
02:56:01.030 --> 02:56:02.100 line:15%
Is Nott still invisible?

4378
02:56:02.100 --> 02:56:02.933 line:15%
I am.

4379
02:56:04.983 --> 02:56:06.370 line:15%
Do you leave the house?

4380
02:56:06.370 --> 02:56:07.203 line:15%
I guess so.

4381
02:56:07.203 --> 02:56:09.121 line:15%
Do I see any shit running down Nott's legs?

4382
02:56:09.121 --> 02:56:10.030 line:15%
(laughter)

4383
02:56:10.030 --> 02:56:11.220 line:15%
Does it?
Invisible shit.

4384
02:56:11.220 --> 02:56:13.510 line:15%
Just a little.
Ah, invisible shit (laughs).

4385
02:56:13.510 --> 02:56:14.471 line:15%
I can see it.

4386
02:56:14.471 --> 02:56:15.304 line:15%
(laughter)

4387
02:56:15.304 --> 02:56:16.590 line:15%
Oh, he's still seeing invisibility.

4388
02:56:16.590 --> 02:56:17.433 line:15%
Yeah.

4389
02:56:17.433 --> 02:56:20.598 line:15%
(laughter)

4390
02:56:20.598 --> 02:56:22.653 line:15%
Little, little bit, little trickle.

4391
02:56:23.682 --> 02:56:25.652 line:15%
The rest of us just see rabbit pellets appear.

4392
02:56:25.652 --> 02:56:27.468 line:15%
(laughter)

4393
02:56:27.468 --> 02:56:29.490 line:15%
MATT: (popping)

4394
02:56:29.490 --> 02:56:31.130 line:15%
Yasha, do you walk with them?

4395
02:56:32.974 --> 02:56:34.690 line:15%
Because you're at the threshold.

4396
02:56:34.690 --> 02:56:35.523 line:15%
Yeah.

4397
02:56:35.523 --> 02:56:36.970 line:15%
Okay.

4398
02:56:36.970 --> 02:56:39.980 line:15%
You watch as she makes these long lumbering strides

4399
02:56:39.980 --> 02:56:42.830 line:15%
towards the house, the arms swaying unnaturally

4400
02:56:42.830 --> 02:56:44.300 line:15%
from side to side.

4401
02:56:44.300 --> 02:56:47.520 line:15%
As she reaches the base of the rock, there's a pause,

4402
02:56:47.520 --> 02:56:51.120 line:15%
and then (crackles) she skitters up the side like a spider,

4403
02:56:51.120 --> 02:56:53.240 line:15%
before getting to the top.

4404
02:56:53.240 --> 02:56:54.810 line:15%
I don't like it, go away.

4405
02:56:54.810 --> 02:56:56.110 line:15%
That's bad, you're bad.

4406
02:56:56.110 --> 02:56:59.390 line:15%
She steps inside the house, leaving the door open.

4407
02:56:59.390 --> 02:57:03.290 line:15%
You see her spin from the inside and rest,

4408
02:57:03.290 --> 02:57:06.940 line:15%
sitting on what looks like a stool,

4409
02:57:06.940 --> 02:57:11.110 line:15%
but you see her pull a large box, one of the crates

4410
02:57:11.110 --> 02:57:13.360 line:15%
that was empty on the side, as a chair,

4411
02:57:13.360 --> 02:57:15.550 line:15%
scoots it up and sits on the opposite side of the table

4412
02:57:15.550 --> 02:57:18.080 line:15%
and (squeaks) arranges it in front of her,

4413
02:57:18.080 --> 02:57:20.825 line:15%
takes the lantern, sets it on a hook.

4414
02:57:20.825 --> 02:57:21.950 line:15%
MARISHA: (groans)

4415
02:57:21.950 --> 02:57:23.880 line:15%
Who wishes to talk?

4416
02:57:23.880 --> 02:57:25.540 line:15%
Ugh, gross.

4417
02:57:29.670 --> 02:57:32.220 line:15%
Well, two of you are here for a reason,

4418
02:57:32.220 --> 02:57:34.200 line:15%
and all of us can get our palms read.

4419
02:57:35.320 --> 02:57:37.200 line:15%
Would you prefer if someone else went first?

4420
02:57:37.200 --> 02:57:38.033 line:15%
Yes.

4421
02:57:38.890 --> 02:57:40.950 line:15%
Yes, I don't know what to expect, yes.

4422
02:57:42.230 --> 02:57:43.807 line:15%
Someone with lower stakes.

4423
02:57:43.807 --> 02:57:44.870 line:15%
By all means.

4424
02:57:44.870 --> 02:57:45.800 line:15%
Sure, I'll go.

4425
02:57:47.940 --> 02:57:50.480 line:15%
Well, I mean, if somebody has to go.

4426
02:57:50.480 --> 02:57:51.313 line:15%
I'll talk.

4427
02:57:54.160 --> 02:57:55.386 line:15%
So you enter the house?

4428
02:57:55.386 --> 02:57:56.360 line:15%
Mm-hmm.
Okay.

4429
02:57:57.210 --> 02:57:59.020 line:15%
Speed dating.
All by yourself?

4430
02:57:59.020 --> 02:58:02.390 line:15%
You step into the room, and it's tight quarters

4431
02:58:02.390 --> 02:58:03.730 line:15%
with the two of you in there.

4432
02:58:03.730 --> 02:58:05.020 line:15%
You're about five feet

4433
02:58:05.020 --> 02:58:07.690 line:15%
from her, comfortably.
I don't like it.

4434
02:58:07.690 --> 02:58:09.240 line:15%
As you step into the chamber,

4435
02:58:09.240 --> 02:58:12.680 line:15%
the door (whooshes) closes behind you, on its own.

4436
02:58:12.680 --> 02:58:15.430 line:15%
You guys lose all sight of Fjord.

4437
02:58:15.430 --> 02:58:16.660 line:15%
The chamber is just closed,

4438
02:58:16.660 --> 02:58:18.560 line:15%
and the interior light is not visible.

4439
02:58:20.328 --> 02:58:21.830 line:15%
We can't even look through the windows.

4440
02:58:21.830 --> 02:58:22.663 line:15%
There are no windows.

4441
02:58:22.663 --> 02:58:23.846 line:15%
We can't even hear anything?
Not even in the front.

4442
02:58:23.846 --> 02:58:25.339 line:15%
No door, no, there is a door.

4443
02:58:25.339 --> 02:58:28.115 line:15%
(laughter)

4444
02:58:28.115 --> 02:58:30.060 line:15%
I thought there were windows in the front.

4445
02:58:30.060 --> 02:58:33.890 line:15%
The lantern marked ahead lights the room,

4446
02:58:33.890 --> 02:58:35.000 line:15%
but the shadow's still cast

4447
02:58:35.000 --> 02:58:36.560 line:15%
across the upper half of the face,

4448
02:58:36.560 --> 02:58:39.350 line:15%
and you can see the piercing and a faint glow

4449
02:58:39.350 --> 02:58:41.660 line:15%
of green eyes, from underneath,

4450
02:58:41.660 --> 02:58:42.780 line:15%
looking right at you.

4451
02:58:42.780 --> 02:58:45.930 line:15%
The arms spread out akimbo

4452
02:58:45.930 --> 02:58:48.260 line:15%
and grasping the sides of her knees,

4453
02:58:48.260 --> 02:58:49.560 line:15%
as she stares towards you.

4454
02:58:51.490 --> 02:58:52.323 line:15%
So?

4455
02:58:57.600 --> 02:59:00.280 line:15%
Oh, you're waiting for me to speak.

4456
02:59:01.760 --> 02:59:03.930 line:15%
I assume you came with a reason.

4457
02:59:05.680 --> 02:59:06.720 line:15%
I did.

4458
02:59:06.720 --> 02:59:08.780 line:15%
Forgive me, the words fall a bit short

4459
02:59:08.780 --> 02:59:12.700 line:15%
when you're in the room of something as revered

4460
02:59:12.700 --> 02:59:14.340 line:15%
and mysterious as yourself.

4461
02:59:14.340 --> 02:59:15.840 line:15%
We've actually done quite

4462
02:59:15.840 --> 02:59:18.600 line:15%
a bit of research.
MATT: (laughs)

4463
02:59:18.600 --> 02:59:21.600 line:15%
Flattery, I like it.

4464
02:59:23.650 --> 02:59:24.550 line:15%
Happy to please.

4465
02:59:26.810 --> 02:59:29.470 line:15%
I suppose my question would start with,

4466
02:59:32.220 --> 02:59:37.220 line:15%
it seems one of our party was affected by something

4467
02:59:38.160 --> 02:59:39.860 line:15%
that you might have done with her.

4468
02:59:41.740 --> 02:59:45.170 line:15%
It is of great interest to us if we might be able

4469
02:59:45.170 --> 02:59:48.717 line:15%
to discuss a way to lift your effect.

4470
02:59:52.550 --> 02:59:55.270 line:15%
I take it you mean the goblin among you.

4471
02:59:56.323 --> 02:59:57.156 line:15%
I'm invisible.

4472
02:59:57.156 --> 02:59:57.989 line:15%
She can't see me.

4473
02:59:57.989 --> 03:00:00.551 line:15%
There is not much that escapes your view.

4474
03:00:00.551 --> 03:00:05.551 line:15%
Well, that was quite the favor I had repaid that day.

4475
03:00:10.140 --> 03:00:10.973 line:15%
Favor?

4476
03:00:12.569 --> 03:00:13.410 line:15%
Repaid?

4477
03:00:20.280 --> 03:00:21.980 line:15%
I am a woman of my word.

4478
03:00:23.680 --> 03:00:28.680 line:15%
It takes a lot to ask me to break of my promises.

4479
03:00:32.330 --> 03:00:35.160 line:15%
I have a reputation to maintain.

4480
03:00:37.220 --> 03:00:38.920 line:15%
You've done a beautiful job.

4481
03:00:41.240 --> 03:00:44.300 line:15%
Might I ask, you said a favor was repaid.

4482
03:00:45.350 --> 03:00:48.270 line:15%
I can't imagine someone of your ilk is

4483
03:00:48.270 --> 03:00:50.680 line:15%
in need of services very often.

4484
03:00:52.600 --> 03:00:53.830 line:15%
Not often, no.

4485
03:00:55.740 --> 03:00:59.660 line:15%
Circumstances can sometimes be strange.

4486
03:01:02.480 --> 03:01:03.320 line:15%
I understand.

4487
03:01:04.200 --> 03:01:06.380 line:15%
We happen to be a group of individuals

4488
03:01:06.380 --> 03:01:11.200 line:15%
that often find ourselves in strange circumstances.

4489
03:01:12.090 --> 03:01:14.290 line:15%
Perhaps we could be of use to you.

4490
03:01:19.447 --> 03:01:21.680 line:15%
MATT: (grunts)

4491
03:01:21.680 --> 03:01:23.195 line:15%
Make a persuasion check.

4492
03:01:23.195 --> 03:01:24.224 line:15%
Oh my god,

4493
03:01:24.224 --> 03:01:27.842 line:15%
he asked her.
Yeah, I bet she can.

4494
03:01:29.440 --> 03:01:30.690 line:15%
With disadvantage, right?

4495
03:01:30.690 --> 03:01:32.291 line:15%
Mm-hmm.
Ooh!

4496
03:01:32.291 --> 03:01:34.650 line:15%
That was a 22, and that's a 10.

4497
03:01:34.650 --> 03:01:36.240 line:15%
Oh, it was so good.

4498
03:01:36.240 --> 03:01:37.073 line:15%
A 10?

4499
03:01:37.073 --> 03:01:38.137 line:15%
Yeah.

4500
03:01:38.137 --> 03:01:41.979 line:15%
Dang it, 40.

4501
03:01:41.979 --> 03:01:44.080 line:15%
No favors.

4502
03:01:47.370 --> 03:01:51.340 line:15%
I thrive on my connections.

4503
03:01:54.860 --> 03:01:58.180 line:15%
One could trade, perhaps.

4504
03:01:59.300 --> 03:02:00.133 line:15%
Trade?

4505
03:02:05.560 --> 03:02:07.160 line:15%
You seem to know all.

4506
03:02:08.042 --> 03:02:09.660 line:15%
MATT: (laughs)
Is there anything

4507
03:02:09.660 --> 03:02:11.730 line:15%
that you have a particular interest in?

4508
03:02:14.320 --> 03:02:15.990 line:15%
I've seen many lifetimes.

4509
03:02:18.430 --> 03:02:22.220 line:15%
And I (cracks), and you hear this heavy crack

4510
03:02:22.220 --> 03:02:24.727 line:15%
as the neck snaps in an unnatural way.

4511
03:02:24.727 --> 03:02:27.028 line:15%
No.
MATT: (snarls)

4512
03:02:27.028 --> 03:02:27.861 line:15%
Incorrect.

4513
03:02:27.861 --> 03:02:30.361 line:15%
(laughter)

4514
03:02:35.690 --> 03:02:40.690 line:15%
I enjoy being tethered to misery.

4515
03:02:46.660 --> 03:02:49.850 line:15%
It feeds me.

4516
03:02:52.030 --> 03:02:57.030 line:15%
And your friend has been a delicious drip.

4517
03:03:06.744 --> 03:03:07.577 line:15%
Hmm.

4518
03:03:08.580 --> 03:03:09.990 line:15%
I'm sure you can understand I don't want

4519
03:03:09.990 --> 03:03:13.450 line:15%
to speak for any of the other members of our group,

4520
03:03:13.450 --> 03:03:18.450 line:15%
but there may be more misery amongst us.

4521
03:03:24.000 --> 03:03:28.200 line:15%
Existing misery is paltry.

4522
03:03:30.640 --> 03:03:32.524 line:15%
New misery--

4523
03:03:32.524 --> 03:03:34.150 line:15%
Ah.

4524
03:03:34.150 --> 03:03:36.630 line:15%
That is lasting.

4525
03:03:41.010 --> 03:03:41.843 line:15%
Gross.

4526
03:03:41.843 --> 03:03:43.350 line:15%
I care very much for these people.

4527
03:03:46.220 --> 03:03:48.440 line:15%
If I am not one to offer you what you would seek,

4528
03:03:48.440 --> 03:03:50.240 line:15%
I'm sure there is someone in our group

4529
03:03:50.240 --> 03:03:54.210 line:15%
that may be able to satisfy, but is there anything,

4530
03:03:55.300 --> 03:03:58.400 line:15%
as you see through me, that interests you?

4531
03:04:01.530 --> 03:04:04.450 line:15%
For this transaction, perhaps not.

4532
03:04:04.450 --> 03:04:09.450 line:15%
But if you seek other enlightenment,

4533
03:04:13.690 --> 03:04:16.120 line:15%
shifting one's fortunes,

4534
03:04:18.210 --> 03:04:23.210 line:15%
a change in the backhand of fate, if you will,

4535
03:04:25.700 --> 03:04:28.930 line:15%
I could turn that around a bit.

4536
03:04:31.622 --> 03:04:34.910 line:15%
You paint an alluring picture, but no.

4537
03:04:36.150 --> 03:04:37.290 line:15%
I thank you for your time.

4538
03:04:37.290 --> 03:04:38.640 line:15%
And I turn, and I leave.

4539
03:04:38.640 --> 03:04:39.950 line:15%
The door's already open for you.

4540
03:04:39.950 --> 03:04:40.990 line:15%
Ooh.
Wow.

4541
03:04:42.120 --> 03:04:45.030 line:15%
That was very good.

4542
03:04:48.280 --> 03:04:52.150 line:15%
She's going to know.
MATT: (sniffing)

4543
03:04:52.150 --> 03:04:53.425 line:15%
No response beyond that?

4544
03:04:53.425 --> 03:04:54.659 line:15%
I walk out.

4545
03:04:54.659 --> 03:04:56.070 line:15%
LAURA: (gasps)
What happened?

4546
03:04:56.070 --> 03:04:56.903 line:15%
Are you okay?

4547
03:04:58.895 --> 03:04:59.857 line:15%
I'm afraid.

4548
03:04:59.857 --> 03:05:01.536 line:15%
Oh shit!
Oh, no, no, no, Fjord!

4549
03:05:01.536 --> 03:05:02.490 line:15%
TRAVIS: (coughing)

4550
03:05:02.490 --> 03:05:04.690 line:15%
Fuck, the humidity change is so dramatic.

4551
03:05:08.400 --> 03:05:09.760 line:15%
She's a deal-maker.

4552
03:05:11.050 --> 03:05:15.540 line:15%
She's attracted by misery, not existing but perhaps new.

4553
03:05:16.830 --> 03:05:19.280 line:15%
It seems we'll have to give something in order to

4554
03:05:20.530 --> 03:05:22.178 line:15%
have your curse lifted.
I walk in.

4555
03:05:22.178 --> 03:05:24.150 line:15%
No!
Oh, come on!

4556
03:05:25.600 --> 03:05:29.160 line:15%
Caleb, as soon as she comes out, Fire Bolt the hut.

4557
03:05:29.160 --> 03:05:31.460 line:15%
You step in, and the door closes behind you.

4558
03:05:32.410 --> 03:05:33.410 line:15%
Okay.
Why wait?

4559
03:05:35.800 --> 03:05:37.260 line:15%
Oh misery.

4560
03:05:37.260 --> 03:05:38.820 line:15%
What's this about new misery?

4561
03:05:40.270 --> 03:05:41.577 line:15%
What now?

4562
03:05:41.577 --> 03:05:44.810 line:15%
MATT: (sniffing)

4563
03:05:44.810 --> 03:05:45.759 line:15%
Yeah, okay.

4564
03:05:45.759 --> 03:05:48.259 line:15%
(laughter)

4565
03:05:50.520 --> 03:05:54.830 line:15%
You have a familiar scent on you.

4566
03:05:54.830 --> 03:05:58.270 line:15%
I can sense we are already tethered in some way.

4567
03:06:00.600 --> 03:06:02.150 line:15%
Tell me.
A familiar taste.

4568
03:06:06.030 --> 03:06:07.040 line:15%
Familiar?

4569
03:06:07.040 --> 03:06:09.990 line:15%
So not new.

4570
03:06:13.440 --> 03:06:14.273 line:15%
Not new.

4571
03:06:16.680 --> 03:06:18.080 line:15%
But I can take new.

4572
03:06:20.010 --> 03:06:22.030 line:15%
What more could you take from me

4573
03:06:22.030 --> 03:06:23.290 line:15%
that you haven't already?

4574
03:06:24.209 --> 03:06:28.537 line:15%
(laughs) You have an imagination, don't you?

4575
03:06:30.280 --> 03:06:31.913 line:15%
Quite a lot.

4576
03:06:31.913 --> 03:06:34.580 line:15%
TRAVIS: (laughs)

4577
03:06:37.063 --> 03:06:38.453 line:15%
What would you give me?

4578
03:06:42.410 --> 03:06:45.110 line:15%
Why don't you start by telling me what you've taken?

4579
03:06:47.740 --> 03:06:48.573 line:15%
From you?

4580
03:06:50.430 --> 03:06:51.400 line:15%
From me and mine.

4581
03:06:54.740 --> 03:06:55.573 line:15%
I have given.

4582
03:06:58.470 --> 03:07:01.100 line:15%
I have granted what was asked of me.

4583
03:07:04.720 --> 03:07:05.553 line:15%
Yeah.

4584
03:07:06.530 --> 03:07:08.170 line:15%
And yet you smell of misery.

4585
03:07:11.840 --> 03:07:15.020 line:15%
You ask a question you already know the answer to.

4586
03:07:16.320 --> 03:07:20.210 line:15%
Nothing's given freely, ever.

4587
03:07:21.590 --> 03:07:24.090 line:15%
MATT: (laughs)

4588
03:07:27.410 --> 03:07:28.243 line:15%
So,

4589
03:07:32.760 --> 03:07:35.650 line:15%
if I already smell of misery, not new misery,

4590
03:07:37.510 --> 03:07:39.060 line:15%
what more could you want?

4591
03:07:43.929 --> 03:07:45.490 line:15%
MATT: (sighs)

4592
03:07:45.490 --> 03:07:50.490 line:15%
She shifts her demeanor towards you, thinking.

4593
03:08:02.200 --> 03:08:06.890 line:15%
It's not about specifically taking.

4594
03:08:09.790 --> 03:08:12.400 line:15%
What I want is to be given something

4595
03:08:13.480 --> 03:08:17.560 line:15%
that you know you would not want to lose.

4596
03:08:22.360 --> 03:08:23.610 line:15%
And then what do I get?

4597
03:08:25.820 --> 03:08:27.100 line:15%
I release your friend.

4598
03:08:30.920 --> 03:08:35.160 line:15%
But the scales have to weigh evenly.

4599
03:08:45.953 --> 03:08:48.120 line:15%
I don't know what it is.

4600
03:09:04.059 --> 03:09:06.559 line:15%
I'll walk away from all of it,

4601
03:09:09.890 --> 03:09:12.240 line:15%
everything that I've worked really hard to get,

4602
03:09:14.320 --> 03:09:17.820 line:15%
this fam-uly, fam, fam, family?

4603
03:09:17.820 --> 03:09:18.653 line:15%
It's in the air.

4604
03:09:18.653 --> 03:09:19.839 line:15%
It's not your fault.

4605
03:09:19.839 --> 03:09:20.672 line:15%
LAURA: (laughs)
It's all of us.

4606
03:09:20.672 --> 03:09:21.590 line:15%
It is.

4607
03:09:21.590 --> 03:09:22.423 line:15%
This family,

4608
03:09:27.140 --> 03:09:28.170 line:15%
my old family,

4609
03:09:32.470 --> 03:09:33.303 line:15%
my new brother,

4610
03:09:38.060 --> 03:09:38.893 line:15%
my position.

4611
03:09:54.430 --> 03:09:58.020 line:15%
She leans forward, interested,

4612
03:09:58.020 --> 03:09:59.170 line:15%
and listening intently.

4613
03:10:03.220 --> 03:10:05.860 line:15%
I've achieved more than I thought I ever would,

4614
03:10:11.730 --> 03:10:13.480 line:15%
richer than I ever thought I would,

4615
03:10:18.960 --> 03:10:21.140 line:15%
more skilled than I ever thought I would.

4616
03:10:25.982 --> 03:10:29.649 line:15%
I don't know what's left, past this, anyway.

4617
03:10:39.370 --> 03:10:40.770 line:15%
Maybe I've peaked, you know.

4618
03:10:46.508 --> 03:10:47.720 line:15%
Choose an exile.

4619
03:10:53.315 --> 03:10:55.430 line:15%
You see her eyes seeming

4620
03:10:55.430 --> 03:10:59.120 line:15%
to look beyond the walls of this chamber

4621
03:10:59.120 --> 03:11:01.580 line:15%
towards the individuals that await you outside.

4622
03:11:05.000 --> 03:11:10.000 line:15%
From this, that is new misery.

4623
03:11:13.440 --> 03:11:15.380 line:15%
Where would I be exiled to?

4624
03:11:18.030 --> 03:11:20.630 line:15%
My choice, yeah, but where would I be?

4625
03:11:22.720 --> 03:11:25.087 line:15%
The inspiration will find you.

4626
03:11:30.780 --> 03:11:33.000 line:15%
Do you accept this transaction?

4627
03:11:42.710 --> 03:11:47.630 line:15%
And what of my family, my blood family?

4628
03:11:49.690 --> 03:11:51.660 line:15%
What of my father and his current deal?

4629
03:11:53.010 --> 03:11:58.010 line:15%
His deal continues until it comes to its fruition.

4630
03:12:00.510 --> 03:12:03.730 line:15%
This is a new deal for a new misery.

4631
03:12:07.740 --> 03:12:09.690 line:15%
Think about it if you're uncertain.

4632
03:12:13.520 --> 03:12:15.890 line:15%
But you've come this far, have you not?

4633
03:12:19.370 --> 03:12:21.860 line:15%
Be a shame to walk away empty-handed.

4634
03:12:30.170 --> 03:12:31.003 line:15%
I leave.

4635
03:12:34.670 --> 03:12:36.030 line:15%
Beauregard exits.

4636
03:12:36.030 --> 03:12:36.910 line:15%
What'd you say, what'd you do?

4637
03:12:36.910 --> 03:12:38.040 line:15%
What happened?
What just happened?

4638
03:12:38.040 --> 03:12:39.120 line:15%
He wants you to talk.

4639
03:12:39.120 --> 03:12:40.043 line:15%
Me?

4640
03:12:40.043 --> 03:12:40.876 line:15%
Yeah.

4641
03:12:42.200 --> 03:12:43.480 line:15%
Beau, what did you do?

4642
03:12:43.480 --> 03:12:45.660 line:15%
She knows you're here, Nott.

4643
03:12:45.660 --> 03:12:46.980 line:15%
I'm invisible.
What did you do?

4644
03:12:46.980 --> 03:12:49.250 line:15%
I didn't do anything.
No, she knows.

4645
03:12:49.250 --> 03:12:50.083 line:15%
Not yet.

4646
03:12:56.790 --> 03:12:57.749 line:15%
All right, I'll go in.

4647
03:12:57.749 --> 03:12:59.790 line:15%
LAURA: (sighs)

4648
03:12:59.790 --> 03:13:00.623 line:15%
Okay.

4649
03:13:02.740 --> 03:13:04.670 line:15%
You muster the courage.

4650
03:13:06.050 --> 03:13:08.150 line:15%
I take a little more sip.
Okay.

4651
03:13:08.150 --> 03:13:09.950 line:15%
It's been quite a while since you drank.

4652
03:13:09.950 --> 03:13:12.050 line:15%
So you're not drunk anymore.

4653
03:13:12.050 --> 03:13:13.750 line:15%
You're on the cusp of a mild headache.

4654
03:13:13.750 --> 03:13:14.600 line:15%
Damn tolerance.

4655
03:13:16.890 --> 03:13:19.930 line:15%
But you enter the chamber, and it closes behind you.

4656
03:13:21.080 --> 03:13:26.080 line:15%
The woman is currently looming over the table,

4657
03:13:27.160 --> 03:13:30.920 line:15%
looking towards you and is just filling most of your vision,

4658
03:13:30.920 --> 03:13:34.190 line:15%
at that point, before she sits into a resting position.

4659
03:13:36.410 --> 03:13:38.590 line:15%
Leans in on the table, looking down at you,

4660
03:13:38.590 --> 03:13:41.130 line:15%
arms crossing, and you see, once again,

4661
03:13:41.130 --> 03:13:44.540 line:15%
like the dual joints bending before folding.

4662
03:13:46.190 --> 03:13:49.330 line:15%
It's been some time, halfling girl.

4663
03:13:50.540 --> 03:13:51.840 line:15%
So you remember me?

4664
03:13:52.890 --> 03:13:54.790 line:15%
I remember everything.

4665
03:13:57.010 --> 03:13:58.860 line:15%
Have you done this to other people?

4666
03:14:02.650 --> 03:14:07.580 line:15%
Not quite this way, but you're not the first punishment

4667
03:14:07.580 --> 03:14:09.110 line:15%
I've been asked to enforce.

4668
03:14:12.720 --> 03:14:15.930 line:15%
Might I ask why?

4669
03:14:18.555 --> 03:14:21.117 line:15%
You said a debt, but what debt?

4670
03:14:27.230 --> 03:14:32.230 line:15%
Let's just say those goblins once did me quite the favor

4671
03:14:37.110 --> 03:14:40.280 line:15%
with something I couldn't achieve myself.

4672
03:14:41.590 --> 03:14:43.580 line:15%
And they did this favor for you

4673
03:14:43.580 --> 03:14:47.610 line:15%
in exchange for a repayment?

4674
03:14:47.610 --> 03:14:48.970 line:15%
For a favor to them.

4675
03:14:51.880 --> 03:14:54.780 line:15%
Then one day they came and called that debt in.

4676
03:14:57.280 --> 03:15:01.840 line:15%
I felt it was maybe a bit small-minded,

4677
03:15:01.840 --> 03:15:05.670 line:15%
but I respect those in the throes

4678
03:15:05.670 --> 03:15:09.630 line:15%
of anger and vengeful fury.

4679
03:15:10.570 --> 03:15:12.220 line:15%
That's a powerful thing.

4680
03:15:15.550 --> 03:15:20.430 line:15%
Just hypothetically, if they didn't exist anymore,

4681
03:15:20.430 --> 03:15:23.940 line:15%
would that debt need be honored.

4682
03:15:24.790 --> 03:15:28.800 line:15%
Oh (laughs), my word is my bind.

4683
03:15:30.620 --> 03:15:32.330 line:15%
Whether or not they're around,

4684
03:15:32.330 --> 03:15:37.330 line:15%
I cannot just discard my promises,

4685
03:15:39.200 --> 03:15:40.810 line:15%
reputation and all that.

4686
03:15:46.990 --> 03:15:49.020 line:15%
And to undo it, you would need some sort

4687
03:15:49.020 --> 03:15:50.930 line:15%
of payment from me?

4688
03:15:52.850 --> 03:15:56.300 line:15%
Or a equal misery in turn.

4689
03:15:59.520 --> 03:16:04.520 line:15%
What if, does the misery have to affect me or my friends?

4690
03:16:07.650 --> 03:16:08.550 line:15%
Can it be anyone?

4691
03:16:09.880 --> 03:16:11.750 line:15%
It can be a misery offered,

4692
03:16:13.140 --> 03:16:17.890 line:15%
but it has to be given freely.

4693
03:16:19.870 --> 03:16:22.680 line:15%
It's hard to take something like that.

4694
03:16:23.820 --> 03:16:28.080 line:15%
The willingness is what makes it so ripe!

4695
03:16:30.526 --> 03:16:31.660 line:15%
The willingness.

4696
03:16:34.840 --> 03:16:37.740 line:15%
So another life, another body, something like that?

4697
03:16:41.800 --> 03:16:42.633 line:15%
What about...

4698
03:16:46.130 --> 03:16:47.480 line:15%
We've got two options here.

4699
03:16:49.010 --> 03:16:51.485 line:15%
How about the life of a weasel?

4700
03:16:51.485 --> 03:16:53.985 line:15%
(laughter)

4701
03:16:56.410 --> 03:16:57.510 line:15%
Not big enough, right?

4702
03:16:58.810 --> 03:17:01.320 line:15%
You're an amusing little one.

4703
03:17:01.320 --> 03:17:03.020 line:15%
I've been drinking a lot, today.

4704
03:17:06.230 --> 03:17:07.530 line:15%
I'm not promising anything,

4705
03:17:07.530 --> 03:17:12.530 line:15%
but what if two warring nations were about

4706
03:17:12.760 --> 03:17:14.440 line:15%
to form a lasting peace,

4707
03:17:14.440 --> 03:17:17.300 line:15%
and that peace just sort of went away?

4708
03:17:18.839 --> 03:17:21.540 line:15%
TALIESIN: (gasps)
Sick, fucking sick.

4709
03:17:23.700 --> 03:17:25.770 line:15%
That would cause misery for thousands,

4710
03:17:26.940 --> 03:17:28.470 line:15%
tens of thousands of people.

4711
03:17:29.740 --> 03:17:33.480 line:15%
Ah, but I am not tethered to that misery,

4712
03:17:36.500 --> 03:17:38.830 line:15%
unless you tether it for me.

4713
03:17:42.030 --> 03:17:44.450 line:15%
The eyes are growing brighter.

4714
03:17:44.450 --> 03:17:45.550 line:15%
How does that work?

4715
03:17:47.980 --> 03:17:50.010 line:15%
Without looking, the hand reaches over

4716
03:17:50.010 --> 03:17:52.760 line:15%
and extends all the way to the shelf

4717
03:17:52.760 --> 03:17:56.190 line:15%
from her sitting position on the opposite end of the room,

4718
03:17:56.190 --> 03:17:59.140 line:15%
and between the fingers, you can see grasping

4719
03:17:59.140 --> 03:18:01.830 line:15%
four different jars and vials

4720
03:18:01.830 --> 03:18:02.930 line:15%
and pulling them over.

4721
03:18:04.630 --> 03:18:05.630 line:15%
I have ways,

4722
03:18:08.140 --> 03:18:13.140 line:15%
tinctures that can bear the connection.

4723
03:18:18.320 --> 03:18:22.300 line:15%
That I would have to take, swallow, apply?

4724
03:18:22.300 --> 03:18:26.833 line:15%
Apply, have them swallow themselves of me.

4725
03:18:34.670 --> 03:18:35.503 line:15%
Swallow.

4726
03:18:42.000 --> 03:18:45.260 line:15%
I won't be able to do it today, obviously.

4727
03:18:46.580 --> 03:18:48.090 line:15%
But if you do this,

4728
03:18:49.940 --> 03:18:54.940 line:15%
then I will remove, happily, this hex I hold on your soul.

4729
03:18:59.090 --> 03:19:01.350 line:15%
And I'll go back to being the way I was?

4730
03:19:03.940 --> 03:19:05.400 line:15%
With the right magic, yes.

4731
03:19:08.510 --> 03:19:09.910 line:15%
I could help with that,

4732
03:19:09.910 --> 03:19:11.960 line:15%
though the process is a bit, uh (laughs),

4733
03:19:13.620 --> 03:19:15.830 line:15%
painful, if familiar.

4734
03:19:17.120 --> 03:19:17.953 line:15%
Yes.

4735
03:19:23.464 --> 03:19:25.300 line:15%
Oh, what does that do?

4736
03:19:25.300 --> 03:19:27.710 line:15%
It just connects you to that person's soul?

4737
03:19:30.870 --> 03:19:32.750 line:15%
It's difficult to explain,

4738
03:19:34.890 --> 03:19:37.950 line:15%
but sure, close enough.

4739
03:19:43.502 --> 03:19:45.480 line:15%
Do I have to leave a deposit or something,

4740
03:19:45.480 --> 03:19:46.980 line:15%
or can I just take one?

4741
03:19:48.390 --> 03:19:50.840 line:15%
Would you agree to my transaction?

4742
03:19:51.930 --> 03:19:55.013 line:15%
I don't know if it's possible even.

4743
03:19:57.114 --> 03:19:57.947 line:15%
Ah.

4744
03:20:00.790 --> 03:20:01.623 line:15%
Oh boy.

4745
03:20:04.600 --> 03:20:06.220 line:15%
I better go talk to my friends.

4746
03:20:07.543 --> 03:20:10.050 line:15%
(clinks) The glasses clink together

4747
03:20:10.050 --> 03:20:11.910 line:15%
as she places them not back on the shelf

4748
03:20:11.910 --> 03:20:16.910 line:15%
but to the floor, beside, in a holding position.

4749
03:20:17.240 --> 03:20:19.640 line:15%
The other hand gives a gesture

4750
03:20:19.640 --> 03:20:22.140 line:15%
as the door (whooshes) opens behind you.

4751
03:20:24.679 --> 03:20:26.729 line:15%
I'll just sort of back out of the room.

4752
03:20:30.540 --> 03:20:32.340 line:15%
Just one more question, before I go.

4753
03:20:33.250 --> 03:20:34.083 line:15%
Yes?

4754
03:20:38.250 --> 03:20:39.900 line:15%
Did you enjoy doing this to me?

4755
03:20:42.634 --> 03:20:44.490 line:15%
Didn't enjoy doing it to you.

4756
03:20:46.690 --> 03:20:48.190 line:15%
I've enjoyed everything since.

4757
03:20:55.240 --> 03:20:56.440 line:15%
All right, I'll leave.

4758
03:21:01.590 --> 03:21:02.940 line:15%
Not much happened in there.

4759
03:21:07.292 --> 03:21:08.530 line:15%
I don't want to kill her,

4760
03:21:08.530 --> 03:21:11.200 line:15%
but I feel like that's going to be super hard.

4761
03:21:13.430 --> 03:21:16.000 line:15%
I actually agree with you,

4762
03:21:16.000 --> 03:21:18.880 line:15%
only because I can't imagine any of us would be able

4763
03:21:18.880 --> 03:21:21.420 line:15%
to give anything that wouldn't shift our lives

4764
03:21:21.420 --> 03:21:23.110 line:15%
or the lives of those around us

4765
03:21:23.110 --> 03:21:24.580 line:15%
without getting what we want.

4766
03:21:25.530 --> 03:21:26.730 line:15%
What did she tell you?

4767
03:21:30.900 --> 03:21:32.730 line:15%
She told me that she could help.

4768
03:21:32.730 --> 03:21:34.110 line:15%
How?

4769
03:21:34.110 --> 03:21:34.943 line:15%
Why?

4770
03:21:34.943 --> 03:21:35.776 line:15%
What did you offer?

4771
03:21:38.890 --> 03:21:41.140 line:15%
Things that don't really affect us, though.

4772
03:21:42.740 --> 03:21:43.573 line:15%
Like what?

4773
03:21:44.720 --> 03:21:46.560 line:15%
Just other people.

4774
03:21:46.560 --> 03:21:47.393 line:15%
Other people?

4775
03:21:47.393 --> 03:21:49.090 line:15%
You offered to torture other people?

4776
03:21:49.090 --> 03:21:51.020 line:15%
I didn't offer to torture anyone.

4777
03:21:51.020 --> 03:21:55.380 line:15%
I just, I would make sure that none of us were harmed

4778
03:21:55.380 --> 03:21:57.500 line:15%
or sacrificed in any way.

4779
03:21:58.480 --> 03:21:59.820 line:15%
That's all dark, Nott.

4780
03:21:59.820 --> 03:22:01.170 line:15%
I don't know what you're talking about.

4781
03:22:01.170 --> 03:22:03.980 line:15%
Well, I mean, there's a lot of evil people out there,

4782
03:22:05.040 --> 03:22:07.810 line:15%
these people who have been waging war against each other,

4783
03:22:07.810 --> 03:22:09.920 line:15%
and they're not innocent.

4784
03:22:13.150 --> 03:22:17.010 line:15%
They've been doing this to each other now for years,

4785
03:22:17.010 --> 03:22:19.570 line:15%
and they could've stopped at any time.

4786
03:22:19.570 --> 03:22:21.780 line:15%
And you singled out specific people?

4787
03:22:25.030 --> 03:22:26.230 line:15%
No, I mean--

4788
03:22:26.230 --> 03:22:28.790 line:15%
Are we talking about the Assembly or--

4789
03:22:28.790 --> 03:22:30.240 line:15%
What did you offer?

4790
03:22:30.240 --> 03:22:32.140 line:15%
I didn't, I mean, I didn't make any deals.

4791
03:22:32.140 --> 03:22:33.870 line:15%
I just said that--

4792
03:22:33.870 --> 03:22:36.750 line:15%
I already had a conversation with her.

4793
03:22:36.750 --> 03:22:37.583 line:15%
Okay.

4794
03:22:37.583 --> 03:22:39.100 line:15%
LIAM and SAM: What did you offer?

4795
03:22:42.420 --> 03:22:43.850 line:15%
I just know whatever she wants,

4796
03:22:43.850 --> 03:22:45.220 line:15%
it's got to be substantial.

4797
03:22:46.240 --> 03:22:49.570 line:15%
So what did you offer?

4798
03:22:57.440 --> 03:23:02.440 line:15%
To, to, to maybe, maybe tether her

4799
03:23:02.590 --> 03:23:06.320 line:15%
to one of the souls of (sighs),

4800
03:23:06.320 --> 03:23:09.500 line:15%
you know, Emperor Dwendal, maybe.

4801
03:23:11.640 --> 03:23:12.473 line:15%
How?

4802
03:23:14.040 --> 03:23:16.410 line:15%
You have to take a, take a pill?

4803
03:23:16.410 --> 03:23:17.243 line:15%
I mean, he's--

4804
03:23:17.243 --> 03:23:18.750 line:15%
That doesn't sound very doable.

4805
03:23:22.060 --> 03:23:22.893 line:15%
Well, I mean,

4806
03:23:25.960 --> 03:23:27.360 line:15%
we can do a lot of things.

4807
03:23:28.440 --> 03:23:29.540 line:15%
Like kill this lady?

4808
03:23:31.013 --> 03:23:33.660 line:15%
I think it's easier to get Dwendal to swallow a pill

4809
03:23:33.660 --> 03:23:36.290 line:15%
than it is to kill this lady.

4810
03:23:37.950 --> 03:23:41.480 line:15%
Dwendal is surrounded by hundreds of loyal subjects.

4811
03:23:41.480 --> 03:23:44.044 line:15%
Yes, but we'll be right next to him.

4812
03:23:44.044 --> 03:23:45.340 line:15%
No, we won't.
We're right next to her.

4813
03:23:47.890 --> 03:23:51.640 line:15%
Plus, it's most certainly not as cut-and-dry as that.

4814
03:23:51.640 --> 03:23:53.330 line:15%
There's always ripples.

4815
03:23:54.610 --> 03:23:55.443 line:15%
Exactly.

4816
03:23:57.170 --> 03:24:01.160 line:15%
Wait, so she wants a sacrifice?

4817
03:24:01.160 --> 03:24:02.290 line:15%
I don't understand.

4818
03:24:02.290 --> 03:24:04.480 line:15%
She said she wanted the scales to be even,

4819
03:24:04.480 --> 03:24:08.060 line:15%
so for the gesture, for lifting the curse from Nott,

4820
03:24:08.060 --> 03:24:12.760 line:15%
whatever the exchange is has to be equally monumental,

4821
03:24:12.760 --> 03:24:17.760 line:15%
devastating, with misery attached to it.

4822
03:24:23.970 --> 03:24:26.330 line:15%
What was it worth to turn you into this?

4823
03:24:28.230 --> 03:24:29.670 line:15%
What did they pay?

4824
03:24:29.670 --> 03:24:30.670 line:15%
For her?
Yeah.

4825
03:24:31.800 --> 03:24:32.633 line:15%
It's a favor.

4826
03:24:32.633 --> 03:24:37.633 line:15%
It's a debt to these goblins, to my old clan.

4827
03:24:38.210 --> 03:24:40.430 line:15%
I offered to make our services available,

4828
03:24:40.430 --> 03:24:42.040 line:15%
and she declined.

4829
03:24:42.040 --> 03:24:43.400 line:15%
I offered to kill the goblins,

4830
03:24:43.400 --> 03:24:45.190 line:15%
and she said that wouldn't be enough.

4831
03:24:45.190 --> 03:24:46.440 line:15%
What did you offer, Beau?

4832
03:24:53.040 --> 03:24:55.190 line:15%
She wants new misery, right?

4833
03:24:55.190 --> 03:24:56.320 line:15%
Mm-hmm.

4834
03:24:56.320 --> 03:24:57.740 line:15%
What if I just go in and, like, offered

4835
03:24:57.740 --> 03:24:59.350 line:15%
to, like, cut off my hand or something?

4836
03:24:59.350 --> 03:25:00.720 line:15%
You think that's enough?

4837
03:25:00.720 --> 03:25:01.553 line:15%
No.

4838
03:25:01.553 --> 03:25:02.810 line:15%
But I really like my hand.

4839
03:25:04.070 --> 03:25:05.540 line:15%
Both.

4840
03:25:05.540 --> 03:25:06.890 line:15%
Both my hands?

4841
03:25:06.890 --> 03:25:08.770 line:15%
And probably several other people's.

4842
03:25:08.770 --> 03:25:10.820 line:15%
You have to no longer be able to paint.

4843
03:25:12.530 --> 03:25:13.880 line:15%
What did you offer, Beau?

4844
03:25:23.910 --> 03:25:24.980 line:15%
I offered war.

4845
03:25:37.060 --> 03:25:41.770 line:15%
I think TJ,

4846
03:25:44.010 --> 03:25:44.910 line:15%
my little brother,

4847
03:25:48.220 --> 03:25:52.650 line:15%
and Luc could be best friends.

4848
03:25:56.780 --> 03:25:59.055 line:15%
Did you offer to kill them?

4849
03:25:59.055 --> 03:25:59.888 line:15%
(laughs) No.

4850
03:26:00.907 --> 03:26:02.033 line:15%
Oh.

4851
03:26:02.033 --> 03:26:02.983 line:15%
What do you mean?

4852
03:26:13.480 --> 03:26:14.720 line:15%
I'm going to be a loner.

4853
03:26:19.850 --> 03:26:20.683 line:15%
I'm used to it.

4854
03:26:21.900 --> 03:26:23.000 line:15%
I'm comfortable there.

4855
03:26:25.400 --> 03:26:26.860 line:15%
What does that mean?

4856
03:26:30.869 --> 03:26:32.740 line:15%
You'd be isolated or something?

4857
03:26:36.170 --> 03:26:37.820 line:15%
The things we've done together,

4858
03:26:44.647 --> 03:26:46.730 line:15%
I'm never going to top that.

4859
03:26:47.950 --> 03:26:51.390 line:15%
And you're right.

4860
03:26:54.550 --> 03:26:58.420 line:15%
We have to fix you, because you have a son.

4861
03:27:00.860 --> 03:27:02.410 line:15%
You have a little boy to raise.

4862
03:27:06.270 --> 03:27:10.390 line:15%
And all of us are eventually going to find our own way.

4863
03:27:13.020 --> 03:27:17.620 line:15%
It's not going to last forever.

4864
03:27:19.210 --> 03:27:20.690 line:15%
And, you know, maybe,

4865
03:27:26.970 --> 03:27:30.990 line:15%
maybe this was what it was all leading to,

4866
03:27:34.010 --> 03:27:36.700 line:15%
Molly's lessons, that you taught me,

4867
03:27:36.700 --> 03:27:41.350 line:15%
and this weird connection between me and you

4868
03:27:41.350 --> 03:27:43.570 line:15%
and this fucking hag and--

4869
03:27:43.570 --> 03:27:44.630 line:15%
What are you talking about?

4870
03:27:44.630 --> 03:27:46.300 line:15%
Are you saying you're going to kill yourself?

4871
03:27:46.300 --> 03:27:47.520 line:15%
Are you saying, what are you saying?

4872
03:27:47.520 --> 03:27:48.353 line:15%
No, no.

4873
03:27:51.460 --> 03:27:53.310 line:15%
She's saying she'll leave all this.

4874
03:27:54.480 --> 03:27:55.830 line:15%
You're going to leave us?

4875
03:27:59.890 --> 03:28:02.540 line:15%
Y'all are the greatest family I could ever ask for.

4876
03:28:05.415 --> 03:28:07.470 line:15%
I can't, I can't top this, you know.

4877
03:28:07.470 --> 03:28:10.490 line:15%
Then don't offer that, don't offer that at all.

4878
03:28:13.610 --> 03:28:17.950 line:15%
But, but (laughs), think about it.

4879
03:28:21.160 --> 03:28:22.600 line:15%
No, she's finally--
I walk in.

4880
03:28:22.600 --> 03:28:24.060 line:15%
It's, its, oh!
Oh!

4881
03:28:24.060 --> 03:28:25.980 line:15%
Okay, the door closes behind you.

4882
03:28:25.980 --> 03:28:26.813 line:15%
Dammit.

4883
03:28:32.850 --> 03:28:35.800 line:15%
You were saying you want misery, and I have it in spades.

4884
03:28:38.920 --> 03:28:40.170 line:15%
What are you looking for?

4885
03:28:52.930 --> 03:28:56.210 line:15%
You walk with heavy scars already.

4886
03:28:59.440 --> 03:29:03.190 line:15%
I don't know if you could offer me a fair trade.

4887
03:29:04.871 --> 03:29:08.640 line:15%
It's hard to feed from those

4888
03:29:08.640 --> 03:29:11.590 line:15%
who already wallow at the bottom.

4889
03:29:16.990 --> 03:29:19.620 line:15%
But I can turn that around for you, if you'd like.

4890
03:29:26.990 --> 03:29:27.823 line:15%
How?

4891
03:29:29.830 --> 03:29:34.440 line:15%
Well, what is it you dream of?

4892
03:29:35.750 --> 03:29:38.610 line:15%
What is it that eludes your grasp?

4893
03:29:38.610 --> 03:29:43.610 line:15%
What is something that you wish for

4894
03:29:44.080 --> 03:29:46.080 line:15%
on the night's cloudy sky?

4895
03:30:04.416 --> 03:30:09.060 line:15%
I don't know if you could give me what I want.

4896
03:30:09.060 --> 03:30:10.670 line:15%
Perhaps I can't.

4897
03:30:10.670 --> 03:30:15.380 line:15%
I can do many things, but I have even my limitations.

4898
03:30:22.270 --> 03:30:24.180 line:15%
Can you bring people back from the dead?

4899
03:30:26.956 --> 03:30:31.956 line:15%
Hmm?

4900
03:30:33.280 --> 03:30:38.280 line:15%
It is difficult, but not impossible.

4901
03:31:00.870 --> 03:31:02.400 line:15%
So if you did it,

4902
03:31:02.400 --> 03:31:04.793 line:15%
if you could bring this person back...

4903
03:31:04.793 --> 03:31:07.210 line:15%
MATT: (sighs)

4904
03:31:11.591 --> 03:31:13.260 line:15%
(sighs) No, I...

4905
03:31:17.480 --> 03:31:18.730 line:15%
We're here for one thing.

4906
03:31:20.960 --> 03:31:22.510 line:15%
I don't need anything from you.

4907
03:31:27.080 --> 03:31:28.290 line:15%
But I could give you something

4908
03:31:28.290 --> 03:31:31.330 line:15%
that would cause me a lot of misery to give you.

4909
03:31:33.690 --> 03:31:34.523 line:15%
Yes?

4910
03:31:43.880 --> 03:31:48.670 line:15%
I take out my book from Molly.

4911
03:31:53.250 --> 03:31:56.070 line:15%
I have been collecting things

4912
03:31:56.070 --> 03:31:57.800 line:15%
for someone to bring to them.

4913
03:32:05.910 --> 03:32:07.140 line:15%
These were for my wife.

4914
03:32:11.090 --> 03:32:15.140 line:15%
And I pull out a flower from Molly.

4915
03:32:18.950 --> 03:32:21.450 line:15%
I don't want to give these things away, but I can.

4916
03:32:31.300 --> 03:32:33.500 line:15%
Roll a persuasion check with disadvantage.

4917
03:32:36.080 --> 03:32:40.155 line:15%
It's a persuasion, sorry, pretty low.

4918
03:32:40.155 --> 03:32:44.580 line:15%
That's cocked.

4919
03:32:45.720 --> 03:32:46.553 line:15%
Okay.

4920
03:32:46.553 --> 03:32:48.460 line:15%
LAURA: (laughs)

4921
03:32:48.460 --> 03:32:49.293 line:15%
I rolled a one.

4922
03:32:52.030 --> 03:32:53.680 line:15%
It's a nice book.

4923
03:32:53.680 --> 03:32:55.020 line:15%
Yeah.

4924
03:32:55.020 --> 03:32:57.497 line:15%
A good thought, but (hisses) not equal.

4925
03:33:08.480 --> 03:33:12.800 line:15%
Not all journeys come to a resolution.

4926
03:33:17.930 --> 03:33:19.130 line:15%
I know one resolution.

4927
03:33:21.460 --> 03:33:24.455 line:15%
But I don't think it would end very well for you.

4928
03:33:24.455 --> 03:33:27.038 line:15%
LAURA: (laughs)

4929
03:33:28.980 --> 03:33:32.990 line:15%
You watch as the shoulders pull back a bit,

4930
03:33:32.990 --> 03:33:37.840 line:15%
and you swear, you swear for an instant, her body seems

4931
03:33:37.840 --> 03:33:40.930 line:15%
to swell and grow as the shadows grow

4932
03:33:40.930 --> 03:33:42.370 line:15%
across the walls behind her,

4933
03:33:42.370 --> 03:33:44.550 line:15%
as she sits a little higher in the seat.

4934
03:33:46.830 --> 03:33:48.030 line:15%
Do tell.

4935
03:33:51.150 --> 03:33:52.950 line:15%
Oh, I just meant I would kill you.

4936
03:33:54.376 --> 03:33:55.390 line:15%
MATT: (laughing)
Then maybe all

4937
03:33:55.390 --> 03:33:56.750 line:15%
of this would be resolved.

4938
03:33:59.630 --> 03:34:01.290 line:15%
You guys can hear the laughter emitting

4939
03:34:01.290 --> 03:34:02.660 line:15%
from the inside of the house.
Oh no.

4940
03:34:02.660 --> 03:34:03.872 line:15%
I don't like that.

4941
03:34:03.872 --> 03:34:08.090 line:15%
But I feel like, um,

4942
03:34:10.660 --> 03:34:13.380 line:15%
I don't know, maybe you should hear

4943
03:34:13.380 --> 03:34:15.050 line:15%
what everyone else has to offer,

4944
03:34:15.980 --> 03:34:17.380 line:15%
before we get to that place.

4945
03:34:21.380 --> 03:34:25.380 line:15%
Smart of you, child of the wastes.

4946
03:34:27.263 --> 03:34:29.470 line:15%
(hisses) The door (whooshes) opens up.

4947
03:34:31.550 --> 03:34:33.437 line:15%
She's all yours, whoever wants to go in there.

4948
03:34:33.437 --> 03:34:34.885 line:15%
I go in.
SAM: (gasps)

4949
03:34:34.885 --> 03:34:36.340 line:15%
Fuck!
MATT: (laughs)

4950
03:34:36.340 --> 03:34:38.060 line:15%
One by one, okay!

4951
03:34:40.510 --> 03:34:42.357 line:15%
Oh Jester!
Let's just fuck it up.

4952
03:34:42.357 --> 03:34:45.947 line:15%
Hi!

4953
03:34:45.947 --> 03:34:47.460 line:15%
Hmm.

4954
03:34:47.460 --> 03:34:50.420 line:15%
You're the one that found me.

4955
03:34:50.420 --> 03:34:51.630 line:15%
I did, I did.

4956
03:34:51.630 --> 03:34:53.200 line:15%
I'm really sorry about it.

4957
03:34:56.220 --> 03:34:58.910 line:15%
You know, we just really needed to see, like,

4958
03:34:58.910 --> 03:35:00.450 line:15%
who you were going to come to see,

4959
03:35:00.450 --> 03:35:02.580 line:15%
and I didn't know it would bother you.

4960
03:35:02.580 --> 03:35:04.230 line:15%
You know, I didn't even think about the fact

4961
03:35:04.230 --> 03:35:07.550 line:15%
that it's like, you know, in the future,

4962
03:35:07.550 --> 03:35:09.420 line:15%
if you ever want to scry on us,

4963
03:35:09.420 --> 03:35:11.480 line:15%
I wouldn't blame you, you know,

4964
03:35:11.480 --> 03:35:13.900 line:15%
because I did it to you before.

4965
03:35:13.900 --> 03:35:15.938 line:15%
Can that witch die from anti-misery?

4966
03:35:15.938 --> 03:35:16.771 line:15%
(laughter)

4967
03:35:16.771 --> 03:35:20.170 line:15%
You come, take some.

4968
03:35:22.470 --> 03:35:23.977 line:15%
Right.

4969
03:35:23.977 --> 03:35:24.810 line:15%
Mm-hmm.

4970
03:35:26.410 --> 03:35:28.330 line:15%
What is it you seek?

4971
03:35:28.330 --> 03:35:30.160 line:15%
Oh, I'm just looking for a way to break

4972
03:35:30.160 --> 03:35:32.770 line:15%
that curse that, you know, you gave to my friend.

4973
03:35:32.770 --> 03:35:34.370 line:15%
I don't want her to be a goblin anymore,

4974
03:35:34.370 --> 03:35:37.029 line:15%
because she doesn't want to be a goblin, so--

4975
03:35:37.029 --> 03:35:37.950 line:15%
Right.
Yeah.

4976
03:35:39.340 --> 03:35:43.780 line:15%
Well, have you an offering for trade?

4977
03:35:43.780 --> 03:35:46.400 line:15%
Oh, something that would make me so miserable.

4978
03:35:46.400 --> 03:35:47.800 line:15%
Right, that's what you want?

4979
03:35:49.050 --> 03:35:49.883 line:15%
Yes.

4980
03:35:52.310 --> 03:35:53.250 line:15%
Let's see.

4981
03:35:57.581 --> 03:35:59.277 line:15%
I'm a pretty happy person.

4982
03:36:01.190 --> 03:36:02.880 line:15%
I can see that.

4983
03:36:06.440 --> 03:36:09.630 line:15%
And I said I could offer, like, to give you a hand,

4984
03:36:09.630 --> 03:36:12.130 line:15%
like literally, if I cut my hand off or something.

4985
03:36:15.560 --> 03:36:16.393 line:15%
Or something.

4986
03:36:20.170 --> 03:36:22.290 line:15%
Um...

4987
03:36:22.290 --> 03:36:24.010 line:15%
Those are artistic hands.

4988
03:36:25.080 --> 03:36:26.280 line:15%
Yeah, I paint, I draw.

4989
03:36:28.748 --> 03:36:31.960 line:15%
The mouth curls.
I also play piano.

4990
03:36:31.960 --> 03:36:34.160 line:15%
Do you want me to play something for you?

4991
03:36:36.307 --> 03:36:39.550 line:15%
I'm fine, but thank you.

4992
03:36:39.550 --> 03:36:40.840 line:15%
You know, I bet you don't get a lot

4993
03:36:40.840 --> 03:36:42.720 line:15%
of entertainment out here, right?

4994
03:36:42.720 --> 03:36:46.920 line:15%
What if, in exchange, we, like, play you a concert?

4995
03:36:46.920 --> 03:36:49.130 line:15%
I could paint your portrait.

4996
03:36:49.130 --> 03:36:51.050 line:15%
You don't have any mirrors, you know.

4997
03:36:51.050 --> 03:36:52.850 line:15%
I could show you what you look like.

4998
03:36:56.410 --> 03:36:58.160 line:15%
Back to what you said before.

4999
03:37:00.954 --> 03:37:04.430 line:15%
Are you offering your artistic expression?

5000
03:37:08.250 --> 03:37:13.100 line:15%
Um, like, my, like, ability to draw?

5001
03:37:16.300 --> 03:37:19.560 line:15%
It is something I see brings you much joy.

5002
03:37:22.590 --> 03:37:26.710 line:15%
Um, it does, it does, it really does.

5003
03:37:29.710 --> 03:37:33.510 line:15%
You see saliva gathering at the edges of her mouth,

5004
03:37:34.540 --> 03:37:38.210 line:15%
one single string (slurps) on the table.

5005
03:37:43.310 --> 03:37:46.560 line:15%
If you give me your hands--

5006
03:37:46.560 --> 03:37:48.360 line:15%
Like, literally, like, my hands.

5007
03:37:49.570 --> 03:37:51.880 line:15%
Like, how will I eat, you know?

5008
03:37:51.880 --> 03:37:55.170 line:15%
Like, what if it's just, you know, my ability to draw?

5009
03:37:57.090 --> 03:37:59.740 line:15%
You have friends who can feed you, right?

5010
03:38:02.730 --> 03:38:06.010 line:15%
Oh man, that's going to suck real bad,

5011
03:38:06.010 --> 03:38:07.980 line:15%
to not have any hands at all.

5012
03:38:09.080 --> 03:38:12.814 line:15%
Does it negate it if I go and I grow them back or something?

5013
03:38:12.814 --> 03:38:15.314 line:15%
MATT: (laughs)

5014
03:38:16.850 --> 03:38:18.887 line:15%
I think you know how intense

5015
03:38:24.950 --> 03:38:28.860 line:15%
and lasting these bargains can be.

5016
03:38:28.860 --> 03:38:31.360 line:15%
Oh, right, I wouldn't be able to grow them back.

5017
03:38:33.310 --> 03:38:36.410 line:15%
(blows raspberry)

5018
03:38:36.410 --> 03:38:37.710 line:15%
Both of my hands (laughs),

5019
03:38:39.460 --> 03:38:41.423 line:15%
that just seems so stupid, oh.

5020
03:38:44.647 --> 03:38:45.580 line:15%
LAURA: (laughs)

5021
03:38:45.580 --> 03:38:48.060 line:15%
She flicks a finger, and you see one of the empty cages

5022
03:38:48.060 --> 03:38:49.560 line:15%
in the wall (squeaks),

5023
03:38:50.630 --> 03:38:52.716 line:15%
about the right size for two hands.

5024
03:38:52.716 --> 03:38:55.299 line:15%
LAURA: (laughs)

5025
03:38:58.427 --> 03:39:02.490 line:15%
That's going to make things so difficult.

5026
03:39:02.490 --> 03:39:03.980 line:15%
No hands?

5027
03:39:03.980 --> 03:39:05.080 line:15%
(laughter)

5028
03:39:05.080 --> 03:39:08.140 line:15%
You're the one who offered it.

5029
03:39:11.470 --> 03:39:13.370 line:15%
Individuals make due all the time.

5030
03:39:13.370 --> 03:39:15.650 line:15%
Wait, wait, what about when I cast spells,

5031
03:39:15.650 --> 03:39:16.880 line:15%
like with my fingers?

5032
03:39:16.880 --> 03:39:20.683 line:15%
Is it like Doctor Strange, where, like, I can still do it?

5033
03:39:21.658 --> 03:39:24.158 line:15%
(laughter)

5034
03:39:25.640 --> 03:39:28.770 line:15%
That would be a conversation between you

5035
03:39:28.770 --> 03:39:31.040 line:15%
and whatever entity--

5036
03:39:31.040 --> 03:39:32.090 line:15%
His name's the Traveler.

5037
03:39:32.090 --> 03:39:33.260 line:15%
He's a really powerful god.

5038
03:39:33.260 --> 03:39:35.460 line:15%
I bet he's here, right now, looking over me.

5039
03:39:38.040 --> 03:39:38.873 line:15%
Are you here?
Right.

5040
03:39:40.523 --> 03:39:42.030 line:15%
Have we a deal?

5041
03:39:42.030 --> 03:39:46.170 line:15%
As she leans forward, seeming to consume the interior

5042
03:39:46.170 --> 03:39:51.170 line:15%
of the chamber, looming over and down upon you,

5043
03:39:52.460 --> 03:39:57.160 line:15%
the one lengthy hand reaching out, like this.

5044
03:39:58.910 --> 03:40:02.640 line:15%
Well, hold on, maybe before we make the deal,

5045
03:40:04.240 --> 03:40:07.650 line:15%
I can eat one last cupcake, you know,

5046
03:40:07.650 --> 03:40:09.340 line:15%
since I won't be able to do it.

5047
03:40:16.290 --> 03:40:18.720 line:15%
Okay (sobs).

5048
03:40:19.770 --> 03:40:24.770 line:15%
I'm going to pull out my last blueberry cupcake

5049
03:40:27.280 --> 03:40:28.460 line:15%
that I got.

5050
03:40:28.460 --> 03:40:30.240 line:15%
How long has this been now?

5051
03:40:31.544 --> 03:40:32.377 line:15%
Everybody's been long.

5052
03:40:32.377 --> 03:40:33.490 line:15%
It's been this long.

5053
03:40:33.490 --> 03:40:34.830 line:15%
Everybody's been long.

5054
03:40:34.830 --> 03:40:35.960 line:15%
Beau took forever.

5055
03:40:35.960 --> 03:40:37.520 line:15%
I'm going to walk up and just--

5056
03:40:37.520 --> 03:40:38.620 line:15%
You're not in there.

5057
03:40:38.620 --> 03:40:39.498 line:15%
I'm walking up to the front door.

5058
03:40:39.498 --> 03:40:41.080 line:15%
I'm in the middle of talking!

5059
03:40:41.080 --> 03:40:42.230 line:15%
Let her do her thing.

5060
03:40:45.440 --> 03:40:47.240 line:15%
Please split this cupcake with me.

5061
03:40:49.090 --> 03:40:50.990 line:15%
Have you ever had a blueberry cupcake?

5062
03:40:54.200 --> 03:40:56.570 line:15%
Hmm, I don't believe I have.

5063
03:40:59.910 --> 03:41:03.141 line:15%
See, I'm using my fingers to break it in half.

5064
03:41:03.141 --> 03:41:04.627 line:15%
(laughter)

5065
03:41:04.627 --> 03:41:05.460 line:15%
Oh my god.

5066
03:41:07.600 --> 03:41:09.285 line:15%
Make a persuasion check.

5067
03:41:09.285 --> 03:41:12.164 line:15%
LAURA: (laughs)

5068
03:41:13.559 --> 03:41:15.880 line:15%
(sighs)

5069
03:41:15.880 --> 03:41:17.180 line:15%
24.

5070
03:41:18.150 --> 03:41:20.840 line:15%
She reaches out and grabs the other half of the cupcake.

5071
03:41:21.760 --> 03:41:24.180 line:15%
It's so small in her long,

5072
03:41:24.180 --> 03:41:26.070 line:15%
curly fingers.
(groaning)

5073
03:41:26.070 --> 03:41:29.087 line:15%
Kind of (sniffs).

5074
03:41:29.946 --> 03:41:32.446 line:15%
(wet chewing)

5075
03:41:34.370 --> 03:41:37.200 line:15%
That was sprinkled with the Dust of Deliciousness.

5076
03:41:38.498 --> 03:41:41.150 line:15%
(laughs) Okay.

5077
03:41:45.710 --> 03:41:47.880 line:15%
Remind me what that is again.

5078
03:41:47.880 --> 03:41:52.307 line:15%
That is a dust that makes food taste much better.

5079
03:41:52.307 --> 03:41:54.430 line:15%
(laughter)

5080
03:41:54.430 --> 03:41:56.552 line:15%
And it also gives you a disadvantage

5081
03:41:56.552 --> 03:42:00.080 line:15%
on wisdom checks and wisdom saving throws.

5082
03:42:00.080 --> 03:42:00.913 line:15%
Okay.

5083
03:42:02.972 --> 03:42:06.372 line:15%
And I'm going to cast...

5084
03:42:06.372 --> 03:42:07.755
Modify Memory.

5085
03:42:10.338 --> 03:42:11.738 line:15%
Oh my god.

5086
03:42:12.868 --> 03:42:14.901 line:15%
Swing and hit, swing and hit.

5087
03:42:14.901 --> 03:42:17.474 line:15%
Hold on, hold on.

5088
03:42:17.474 --> 03:42:18.852 line:15%
TRAVIS: My soul hurt so much.

5089
03:42:18.852 --> 03:42:19.685 line:15%
Oh!
God.

5090
03:42:20.720 --> 03:42:23.020 line:15%
Okay.
Oh no.

5091
03:42:23.020 --> 03:42:24.540 line:15%
Okay.

5092
03:42:24.540 --> 03:42:26.670 line:15%
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

5093
03:42:26.670 --> 03:42:28.970 line:15%
And I'm going--

5094
03:42:28.970 --> 03:42:29.890 line:15%
Higher level.
Well, I'm going

5095
03:42:29.890 --> 03:42:30.900 line:15%
to see if it works.

5096
03:42:30.900 --> 03:42:34.090 line:15%
Come on, come on, come on.
(laughs) Okay, hold on.

5097
03:42:34.090 --> 03:42:35.180 line:15%
I mean, it doesn't matter.

5098
03:42:35.180 --> 03:42:37.520 line:15%
It does.

5099
03:42:37.520 --> 03:42:38.353 line:15%
No, it doesn't.

5100
03:42:38.353 --> 03:42:40.300 line:15%
It just affects how long ago I could do it.

5101
03:42:40.300 --> 03:42:42.550 line:15%
This is within the last 24 hours.

5102
03:42:42.550 --> 03:42:46.890 line:15%
So 5th-level is what I need to cast it at.

5103
03:42:46.890 --> 03:42:47.980 line:15%
It is here.

5104
03:42:47.980 --> 03:42:49.290 line:15%
Okay, there we go.

5105
03:42:49.290 --> 03:42:53.310 line:15%
Kiss?
How are we alive?

5106
03:42:53.310 --> 03:42:55.393 line:15%
Okay.
Oh my god, what?

5107
03:43:10.260 --> 03:43:11.390 line:15%
Okay.

5108
03:43:11.390 --> 03:43:12.223 line:15%
Did I succeed?

5109
03:43:13.790 --> 03:43:14.658 line:15%
Yup.

5110
03:43:14.658 --> 03:43:17.075 line:15%
(gasping)

5111
03:43:20.806 --> 03:43:22.740 line:15%
I'm going to make her believe--

5112
03:43:22.740 --> 03:43:23.880 line:15%
Mm-hmm?

5113
03:43:23.880 --> 03:43:26.080 line:15%
That she enjoyed my company so very much

5114
03:43:27.220 --> 03:43:29.470 line:15%
that she agreed to end Nott's curse,

5115
03:43:30.440 --> 03:43:33.046 line:15%
because she liked hanging out so much.

5116
03:43:33.046 --> 03:43:36.091 line:15%
(laughter)

5117
03:43:36.091 --> 03:43:39.774 line:15%
And she hasn't had good company in a very long time.

5118
03:43:41.723 --> 03:43:44.731 line:15%
Laura. Fucking. Bailey.

5119
03:43:53.707 --> 03:43:56.553 line:15%
Just going through the details of the spell here.

5120
03:43:56.553 --> 03:43:58.889 line:15%
I'm having a heart attack.
TALIESIN: (panting)

5121
03:43:58.889 --> 03:44:00.782 line:15%
It was really deliberate.

5122
03:44:00.782 --> 03:44:01.615 line:15%
Fucking family, Nott.

5123
03:44:10.979 --> 03:44:12.229 line:15%
Out of the box.

5124
03:44:16.390 --> 03:44:21.390 line:15%
Okay, so as you complete your incantation,

5125
03:44:24.420 --> 03:44:28.220 line:15%
the minute of describing this shift in time, you--

5126
03:44:34.900 --> 03:44:36.550 line:15%
I get done with telling her that,

5127
03:44:36.550 --> 03:44:38.420 line:15%
and I just start going (laughs),

5128
03:44:38.420 --> 03:44:40.816 line:15%
oh, matron, you are so funny.

5129
03:44:40.816 --> 03:44:44.066 line:15%
LAURA: (and Matt laugh)

5130
03:44:48.238 --> 03:44:51.406 line:15%
MATT: (sighs)

5131
03:44:51.406 --> 03:44:53.656 line:15%
It has been quite a while

5132
03:44:55.790 --> 03:45:00.790 line:15%
since I've taken just a moment

5133
03:45:01.730 --> 03:45:05.879 line:15%
to relax, I suppose.
I know, right?

5134
03:45:05.879 --> 03:45:09.550 line:15%
Everybody needs that.

5135
03:45:11.475 --> 03:45:13.892 line:15%
MATT: (sighs)

5136
03:45:19.672 --> 03:45:21.800 line:15%
Thank you.
Strange day.

5137
03:45:21.800 --> 03:45:24.420 line:15%
I know, but thank you so much.

5138
03:45:25.470 --> 03:45:26.303 line:15%
It means a lot.

5139
03:45:29.780 --> 03:45:31.400 line:15%
You caught me in a good mood.

5140
03:45:36.135 --> 03:45:36.968 line:15%
Well,

5141
03:45:40.330 --> 03:45:45.080 line:15%
should you come across any more of those cupcakes--

5142
03:45:45.080 --> 03:45:46.580 line:15%
I will send them your way.

5143
03:45:46.580 --> 03:45:49.860 line:15%
Do not be afraid to come visit again.

5144
03:45:49.860 --> 03:45:51.440 line:15%
I will definitely do that.

5145
03:45:51.440 --> 03:45:52.420 line:15%
You know, they make some

5146
03:45:52.420 --> 03:45:55.710 line:15%
that are called black moss cupcakes.

5147
03:45:55.710 --> 03:45:58.871 line:15%
I will let you know, because yeah.

5148
03:45:58.871 --> 03:46:01.371 line:15%
(laughter)

5149
03:46:03.912 --> 03:46:04.745 line:15%
Well,

5150
03:46:07.760 --> 03:46:09.517 line:15%
the night grows late.

5151
03:46:09.517 --> 03:46:10.350 line:15%
Yeah, it does, it is.

5152
03:46:10.350 --> 03:46:12.670 line:15%
It's getting dark outside.

5153
03:46:14.690 --> 03:46:17.140 line:15%
Is there anything else I can help you with,

5154
03:46:17.140 --> 03:46:21.780 line:15%
something that you have always wanted?

5155
03:46:23.310 --> 03:46:26.470 line:15%
Just your company, you know, thank you.

5156
03:46:26.470 --> 03:46:30.280 line:15%
Should I send my friend Nott in, or is it just,

5157
03:46:30.280 --> 03:46:32.080 line:15%
does it, do you need to see her?

5158
03:46:33.180 --> 03:46:34.986 line:15%
Oh, it's fine.

5159
03:46:34.986 --> 03:46:36.800 line:15%
You see the hand wave past,

5160
03:46:36.800 --> 03:46:39.400 line:15%
and the shadows of the room grow extremely dark.

5161
03:46:39.400 --> 03:46:41.720 line:15%
The lantern fights to maintain a flame.

5162
03:46:42.820 --> 03:46:44.620 line:15%
And then it slowly expands back out.

5163
03:46:47.189 --> 03:46:48.240 line:15%
A deal is a deal.

5164
03:46:51.470 --> 03:46:52.635 line:15%
This has been fun.

5165
03:46:52.635 --> 03:46:55.052 line:15%
MATT: (sighs)

5166
03:46:58.790 --> 03:47:01.010 line:15%
Well, it's a long journey back.

5167
03:47:01.010 --> 03:47:03.730 line:15%
I guess we should head out, huh?

5168
03:47:04.906 --> 03:47:06.456 line:15%
Indeed.
Thank you so much.

5169
03:47:07.859 --> 03:47:09.940 line:15%
MATT: (hisses)
See you later.

5170
03:47:09.940 --> 03:47:12.978 line:15%
See you sometime.
Okay.

5171
03:47:12.978 --> 03:47:15.478 line:15%
MATT: (laughs)

5172
03:47:16.443 --> 03:47:18.383 line:15%
Does the door do the thing?

5173
03:47:19.550 --> 03:47:20.383 line:15%
Right.

5174
03:47:20.383 --> 03:47:22.878 line:15%
(laughter)

5175
03:47:24.480 --> 03:47:27.550 line:15%
She seems very distracted and is trying

5176
03:47:27.550 --> 03:47:32.550 line:15%
to piece together incongruent events but waves a hand

5177
03:47:32.920 --> 03:47:34.820 line:15%
and the door closes behind (thuds).

5178
03:47:34.820 --> 03:47:35.653 line:15%
Ooh!

5179
03:47:36.590 --> 03:47:37.423 line:15%
We got to go.

5180
03:47:37.423 --> 03:47:38.280 line:15%
You're good.

5181
03:47:38.280 --> 03:47:39.130 line:15%
Let's go.
What?

5182
03:47:39.130 --> 03:47:39.963 line:15%
Let's go!

5183
03:47:39.963 --> 03:47:40.796 line:15%
Okay.
Come on, let's go.

5184
03:47:40.796 --> 03:47:41.629 line:15%
Let's go.
What do you mean?

5185
03:47:41.629 --> 03:47:42.720 line:15%
Let's get the fuck out of here.

5186
03:47:42.720 --> 03:47:44.990 line:15%
We're walking.
I need to get the tincture.

5187
03:47:44.990 --> 03:47:46.530 line:15%
No, you don't.

5188
03:47:46.530 --> 03:47:47.970 line:15%
Your curse is broken.

5189
03:47:47.970 --> 03:47:49.300 line:15%
A deal has been made.

5190
03:47:49.300 --> 03:47:50.133 line:15%
Everything's fine.

5191
03:47:50.133 --> 03:47:51.180 line:15%
What did you give her?

5192
03:47:51.180 --> 03:47:52.130 line:15%
What do you mean it's been broken?

5193
03:47:52.130 --> 03:47:53.340 line:15%
I gave her something very precious.

5194
03:47:53.340 --> 03:47:54.173 line:15%
Let's get the fuck out of here.

5195
03:47:54.173 --> 03:47:55.300 line:15%
Your hands are still there.

5196
03:47:55.300 --> 03:47:56.133 line:15%
I know.

5197
03:47:56.133 --> 03:47:57.130 line:15%
You know what?
What did you give her?

5198
03:47:57.130 --> 03:47:59.090 line:15%
She ended up being a really nice lady.

5199
03:47:59.090 --> 03:48:00.790 line:15%
Jester, Jester, are you sure?

5200
03:48:00.790 --> 03:48:02.220 line:15%
Everything's fine.
Then let's go.

5201
03:48:02.220 --> 03:48:03.160 line:15%
Let's walk.
I am so serious.

5202
03:48:03.160 --> 03:48:04.170 line:15%
Let's go.
Let's walk.

5203
03:48:04.170 --> 03:48:06.237 line:15%
Oh, go, okay.
Yes.

5204
03:48:06.237 --> 03:48:07.070 line:15%
Yes.
All right, well,

5205
03:48:07.070 --> 03:48:09.540 line:15%
we're leaving.
Does Nott look the same?

5206
03:48:10.620 --> 03:48:11.520 line:15%
Yeah, Nott looks the same.

5207
03:48:11.520 --> 03:48:12.850 line:15%
Yeah, it's just the curse is lifted,

5208
03:48:12.850 --> 03:48:14.950 line:15%
and we can try that spell again, let's go.

5209
03:48:15.830 --> 03:48:17.520 line:15%
Let's go, let's keep going,

5210
03:48:17.520 --> 03:48:19.210 line:15%
let's go.
You gather your things

5211
03:48:19.210 --> 03:48:22.610 line:15%
and rapidly follow the very insistent Jester back

5212
03:48:22.610 --> 03:48:26.900 line:15%
into now the night shadows of the swamp ahead of you.

5213
03:48:26.900 --> 03:48:28.830 line:15%
Oh god.
Still exhausted,

5214
03:48:30.180 --> 03:48:33.790 line:15%
still recovering from the initial journey,

5215
03:48:34.650 --> 03:48:38.270 line:15%
you briskly vanish into the shadows of night.

5216
03:48:38.270 --> 03:48:39.270 line:15%
200 feet behind them,

5217
03:48:39.270 --> 03:48:40.846 line:15%
my shadow Caleb's going boop, boop, boop, boop.

5218
03:48:40.846 --> 03:48:42.361 line:15%
(laughter)

5219
03:48:42.361 --> 03:48:44.690 line:15%
Hey, hey, hey, bah, bah, bah, bah.

5220
03:48:44.690 --> 03:48:46.840 line:15%
As you make your way into the deep mists,

5221
03:48:48.530 --> 03:48:50.570 line:15%
we're going to end tonight's session there.

5222
03:48:50.570 --> 03:48:52.319 line:15%
What the fuck just happened?
You fucking beast!

5223
03:48:52.319 --> 03:48:54.820 line:15%
You fucking beast!
That was amazing!

5224
03:48:54.820 --> 03:48:56.500 line:15%
Oh my god, what a troll!

5225
03:48:56.500 --> 03:48:58.930 line:15%
I can't even begin to digest,

5226
03:49:00.977 --> 03:49:03.850 line:15%
the Dust of Deliciousness on the cupcake?

5227
03:49:03.850 --> 03:49:04.683
Well, I've been holding on the

5228
03:49:04.683 --> 03:49:07.060
fucking Dust of Deliciousness.
I had forgotten about

5229
03:49:07.060 --> 03:49:08.180
that fucking item.

5230
03:49:09.690 --> 03:49:11.440
And still good for five more servings.

5231
03:49:11.440 --> 03:49:13.080
So obviously, in the moment,

5232
03:49:13.080 --> 03:49:15.910
a legendary moment of this campaign.

5233
03:49:15.910 --> 03:49:18.310
Hold the fucking swing.
Fun point of order,

5234
03:49:19.650 --> 03:49:24.310
fun point of order, the first roll I rolled was a two.

5235
03:49:24.310 --> 03:49:26.880
Then I was like, oh, she's disadvantage.

5236
03:49:26.880 --> 03:49:29.580
Well no, but she has advantage on magic resistance,

5237
03:49:29.580 --> 03:49:31.230
so it's just a roll,

5238
03:49:31.230 --> 03:49:32.940
and still a fail.
It was a two!

5239
03:49:32.940 --> 03:49:34.520
That's what your face journey was.

5240
03:49:34.520 --> 03:49:35.900
It was a complicated one.

5241
03:49:35.900 --> 03:49:38.360
It was like, oh fuck, wait, but it's disadvantage, fuck!

5242
03:49:38.360 --> 03:49:40.630
You completely fucking Gretel-ed his Hansel,

5243
03:49:40.630 --> 03:49:41.940
like it was just--
Yes!

5244
03:49:41.940 --> 03:49:43.240
Yeah.

5245
03:49:43.240 --> 03:49:47.220
Oh my god, you fed a witch a baked good, how?

5246
03:49:47.220 --> 03:49:50.580
For every Inflict Wounds that has failed, that your dice

5247
03:49:51.462 --> 03:49:52.295
have failed you on--
Oh, oh, it's been leading

5248
03:49:52.295 --> 03:49:53.584
up to this.

5249
03:49:53.584 --> 03:49:55.834
That was payback.
That was the greatest.

5250
03:49:57.141 --> 03:49:58.162
That was a major moment.

5251
03:49:58.162 --> 03:49:58.995
I would've started

5252
03:49:58.995 --> 03:49:59.828
a war again.
You did that

5253
03:49:59.828 --> 03:50:00.661
with a baked good.
I know!

5254
03:50:00.661 --> 03:50:02.010
(laughter)

5255
03:50:02.010 --> 03:50:04.520
Beau was about to just walk away from everything.

5256
03:50:04.520 --> 03:50:05.353
I would've sacrificed

5257
03:50:05.353 --> 03:50:06.550
thousands of lives.
What the fuck?

5258
03:50:06.550 --> 03:50:08.820
We are some dark--
No, made up my mind,

5259
03:50:08.820 --> 03:50:10.320
so still processing.
Dire motherfuckers!

5260
03:50:10.320 --> 03:50:12.580
You sacrificed a cupcake!

5261
03:50:12.580 --> 03:50:14.913
Yeah.
LAURA: (laughs)

5262
03:50:14.913 --> 03:50:17.060
And it was probably pretty moldy.

5263
03:50:17.060 --> 03:50:19.210
It was an old-ass cupcake.

5264
03:50:19.210 --> 03:50:23.540
World War III or a Hostess cupcake (laughs).

5265
03:50:23.540 --> 03:50:25.050
Is Modify Memory permanent?

5266
03:50:25.050 --> 03:50:25.883
Yes.
Yeah.

5267
03:50:25.883 --> 03:50:26.750
Yeah.
Unless somebody

5268
03:50:26.750 --> 03:50:27.825
gets it out of them.
It's permanent?

5269
03:50:27.825 --> 03:50:29.970
Yup, it's permanent.

5270
03:50:29.970 --> 03:50:31.020
She will forever--

5271
03:50:31.020 --> 03:50:33.810
It's permanent until Greater Restoration

5272
03:50:33.810 --> 03:50:34.930
or Remove Curse is cast.

5273
03:50:34.930 --> 03:50:37.390
And if they don't know that anything happened,

5274
03:50:37.390 --> 03:50:39.790
then why would they ever ask for that?

5275
03:50:39.790 --> 03:50:41.430
Yeah, it will only undo if something--

5276
03:50:41.430 --> 03:50:42.760
She just seemed to be dealing

5277
03:50:42.760 --> 03:50:46.100
with the incongruent elements of her day's events.

5278
03:50:46.100 --> 03:50:47.820
Yeah, there's a fair chance we've

5279
03:50:47.820 --> 03:50:48.653
Rakshasa-ed this shit.
There's a fair chance,

5280
03:50:48.653 --> 03:50:50.750
but you know what, we moved.

5281
03:50:50.750 --> 03:50:54.060
A very long-living, very intelligent

5282
03:50:54.060 --> 03:50:55.480
and conniving individual

5283
03:50:55.480 --> 03:50:58.260
that has made their living feeding off the misery

5284
03:50:58.260 --> 03:51:00.030
of other people that she's tricked them into--

5285
03:51:00.030 --> 03:51:01.520
LAURA: Oh my god.

5286
03:51:01.520 --> 03:51:03.550
But we'll pick this up, next Thursday!

5287
03:51:03.550 --> 03:51:06.240
Oh, oh!
I just cannot believe it.

5288
03:51:06.240 --> 03:51:07.130
Holy shit.

5289
03:51:07.130 --> 03:51:09.080
I am so proud of you, Laura Bailey.

5290
03:51:09.080 --> 03:51:11.770
That was so clutch.
That was some goddamned

5291
03:51:11.770 --> 03:51:14.610
walk-off, ninth inning grand slam World Series shit.

5292
03:51:14.610 --> 03:51:15.820
As a dungeon master,

5293
03:51:17.380 --> 03:51:20.850
that was one of the more frustrating moments,

5294
03:51:20.850 --> 03:51:22.860
like as a person that's built

5295
03:51:22.860 --> 03:51:26.180
to an intense encounter like this,

5296
03:51:27.650 --> 03:51:29.970
and one of the most proud I've been

5297
03:51:29.970 --> 03:51:31.600
of a player outsmarting me.

5298
03:51:31.600 --> 03:51:32.830
Uh-huh, uh-huh.
Wow.

5299
03:51:32.830 --> 03:51:33.663
It was cool, though,

5300
03:51:33.663 --> 03:51:36.610
because we could see your, like, vague disappointment

5301
03:51:36.610 --> 03:51:39.880
of like, no, this is my big, no, I'm leaning into this.

5302
03:51:39.880 --> 03:51:44.020
There is a hidden map over there, behind us,

5303
03:51:44.020 --> 03:51:47.050
special curtain, that we're never going to see.

5304
03:51:47.050 --> 03:51:48.220
We're never going to see.
Maybe.

5305
03:51:48.220 --> 03:51:49.320
LAURA: Well, maybe.

5306
03:51:50.369 --> 03:51:51.202
Well, we'll see.
You don't know.

5307
03:51:52.335 --> 03:51:53.310
She might come after us.
We could walk into the swamp

5308
03:51:53.310 --> 03:51:54.400
and hear a scream.

5309
03:51:54.400 --> 03:51:57.540
Yup, that's true.
(Ashley screeches)

5310
03:51:57.540 --> 03:52:01.150
But nevertheless, that's the end of our session tonight.

5311
03:52:01.150 --> 03:52:03.520
We'll be back with this next Thursday.

5312
03:52:03.520 --> 03:52:04.440
Fudge, wow.
Oh man,

5313
03:52:04.440 --> 03:52:06.300
I want to throw up.
I'm so happy.

5314
03:52:07.537 --> 03:52:09.880
I'm going to have to just chew on that one, tonight.

5315
03:52:09.880 --> 03:52:11.150
Holy fuck, Laura.

5316
03:52:11.150 --> 03:52:13.570
We're, like, creepy as fuck in each one of those,

5317
03:52:13.570 --> 03:52:15.160
what do we call them?
Oh, that was so good.

5318
03:52:15.160 --> 03:52:16.190
Interviews?

5319
03:52:16.190 --> 03:52:18.120
What a session!

5320
03:52:18.120 --> 03:52:20.060
What are these long-fingered creatures

5321
03:52:20.060 --> 03:52:22.360
that we've encountered?
Double elbows?

5322
03:52:22.360 --> 03:52:24.880
Well, like, the Keona the Keen just happened

5323
03:52:24.880 --> 03:52:26.920
to be a character you went to.

5324
03:52:26.920 --> 03:52:28.260
This one's been playing for a long time.

5325
03:52:28.260 --> 03:52:29.093
Oh my god.

5326
03:52:30.460 --> 03:52:31.570
I thought you were going to go, like,

5327
03:52:31.570 --> 03:52:34.690
give her a tarot card reading or something.

5328
03:52:34.690 --> 03:52:36.410
Something equally stupid.
I was like, she's going to

5329
03:52:36.410 --> 03:52:37.243
do something weird.
I had cards ready.

5330
03:52:37.243 --> 03:52:38.351
ASHLEY: But I had no idea.

5331
03:52:38.351 --> 03:52:39.420
Oh, see?

5332
03:52:39.420 --> 03:52:40.280
I've been waiting.
I know.

5333
03:52:40.280 --> 03:52:41.770
I've got, like, two more in there.

5334
03:52:41.770 --> 03:52:43.190
Yeah, got, like, three more now.

5335
03:52:43.190 --> 03:52:44.258
That was so cool.
Oh, now I can turn on

5336
03:52:44.258 --> 03:52:45.525
my phone again.

5337
03:52:45.525 --> 03:52:47.580
My Tactics Ogre.

5338
03:52:48.590 --> 03:52:50.240
LAURA: Oh my god.

5339
03:52:50.240 --> 03:52:53.363
Cards there, just in case somebody wanted to go ahead

5340
03:52:53.363 --> 03:52:55.300
and get a reading based on them wanting something

5341
03:52:55.300 --> 03:52:57.120
and making an exchange like Thoreau did.

5342
03:52:57.120 --> 03:52:59.440
Oh yeah.
TRAVIS: (sighs)

5343
03:52:59.440 --> 03:53:01.980
Oh, man, all righty, well, nevertheless--

5344
03:53:01.980 --> 03:53:02.813
TALIESIN: Fuck.

5345
03:53:03.921 --> 03:53:06.080
Thank you, guys, so much for joining us.

5346
03:53:06.080 --> 03:53:07.330
We'll pick it up next Thursday.

5347
03:53:07.330 --> 03:53:08.780
We love you very much.

5348
03:53:08.780 --> 03:53:10.250
And is it Thursday yet?

5349
03:53:10.250 --> 03:53:11.100
Good night.

5350
03:53:11.100 --> 03:53:12.585
TRAVIS: Not for another week!

5351
03:53:12.585 --> 03:53:13.418
I know.

5352
03:53:13.418 --> 03:53:15.216
TRAVIS: What the fuck?

5353
03:53:15.216 --> 03:53:18.383
(dramatic folk music)
