00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:01.240
MATT: Hello everyone and welcome to

2
00:00:01.240 --> 00:00:02.460
tonight's episode of Critical Role

3
00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:03.620
where a bunch of us nerdy-ass voice actors

4
00:00:03.620 --> 00:00:05.173
sit around and play Dungeons &amp; Dragons.

5
00:00:05.173 --> 00:00:07.717
ALL: We play Dungeons &amp; Dragons!

6
00:00:07.717 --> 00:00:08.810
MATT: There you have it.

7
00:00:08.810 --> 00:00:10.870
Before we jump into tonight's session,

8
00:00:10.870 --> 00:00:13.869
we do have some announcements

9
00:00:13.869 --> 00:00:15.069
that'll begin with some sponsors,

10
00:00:15.069 --> 00:00:16.470
but part of the first sponsorship

11
00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:17.510
ties in with one of the announcements,

12
00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:19.060
so I'll go and get to that first.

13
00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:20.600
For those who haven't seen on social media,

14
00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:21.950
the announcements and such,

15
00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:24.760
we've partnered with our friends at

16
00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:26.730
Dungeons &amp; Dragons and Wizards of the Coast

17
00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:28.967
to release an upcoming

18
00:00:28.967 --> 00:00:32.191
Explorer's Guide to Wildemount, an actual--

19
00:00:32.191 --> 00:00:33.340
(cheering)

20
00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:35.230
- full setting, full campaign setting

21
00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:36.740
for the entirety of the continent

22
00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:38.580
of Wildemount that you guys have watched

23
00:00:38.580 --> 00:00:41.510
in this campaign and so much more beyond that.

24
00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:44.920
It's been, like, a year plus of my life

25
00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:46.180
on top of everything else to work it out.

26
00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:49.050
I'm super proud of it and the wonderful contributors

27
00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:50.610
that helped flesh out the world

28
00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:53.150
even just beyond what I had worked on.

29
00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:55.590
It's something I'm really proud of and I hope you guys

30
00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:57.590
have an opportunity to check it out.

31
00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:59.600
It's up for preorder now where are places

32
00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:02.500
you can mostly find RPG book preorders

33
00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:04.950
and it'll be coming out on March 17th,

34
00:01:04.950 --> 00:01:08.390
so about two months from now.

35
00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:10.420
It's got not just, like, world lore

36
00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:12.710
and, you know, a lot of elements about

37
00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:15.110
just the story and setting-centric stuff,

38
00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:16.370
there's a lot of player options

39
00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:19.360
including three new sub-classes, dunamancy spells,

40
00:01:21.010 --> 00:01:24.090
some new sub-races, some other fun stuff, new creatures,

41
00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:26.580
new magical items, new artifacts and Vestiges of Divergence.

42
00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:29.570
It's going to be a lot of fun, so I hope you enjoy it.

43
00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:32.720
And for those of you who are looking to buy it

44
00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:35.280
or preorder it and can afford it,

45
00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:38.840
I highly recommend you go do so at your local game store.

46
00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:41.110
You know, online sometimes is the only way people

47
00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:43.580
can afford it, but if you can, support those local shops.

48
00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:47.499
That's where the community thrives, so definitely do so.

49
00:01:47.499 --> 00:01:48.765
(whooping)

50
00:01:48.765 --> 00:01:51.250
And leading into that, our first sponsor tonight

51
00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:53.740
is our returning friends at D&amp;D Beyond.

52
00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:55.880
ALL: D&amp;D Beyond!

53
00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:58.810
MATT: Which, on D&amp;D Beyond, preorders for

54
00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:00.280

56
00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:04.070

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:06.230
some of these things into your game

58
00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:09.380

59
00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:11.350

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:13.350
You can grab the digital version right now and receive

61
00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:15.930
a bonus, looks like six exclusive character sheet

62
00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:18.110
backgrounds in six matching color themes

63
00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:19.610
to go with the book's release,

64
00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:21.020
which is awesome, and they also have

65
00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:22.750
some other great promos going that you can find

66
00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:26.810
on the site at dndbeyond.link/critter.

67
00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:28.780
Go ahead and check that out and thank you guys so much

68
00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:31.270
for supporting our show for as long as you have.

69
00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:36.107
Our second sponsor tonight, (clears throat)

70
00:02:36.107 --> 00:02:40.284
as I prepare myself, is NordVPN. Sam.

71
00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:44.930
SAM: Hold my calls and greetings, netizens!

72
00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:46.700
It's the master of the dark web,

73
00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:51.150
online known as blackwillow73@aol.com.

74
00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:54.100
I'm cracking code and spinning my webs with ease

75
00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:57.290
because my hardware's protected by NordVPN,

76
00:02:57.290 --> 00:03:00.580
a personal virtual private network service provider

77
00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:04.230
with 5,000 servers in 60 countries

78
00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:06.650
that shields you from hackzors like me,

79
00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:10.280
protects you on public wifi, and even blocks annoying ads.

80
00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:11.620
Yeah, I know everything about

81
00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:15.150
the info super-biway except the identity

82
00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:19.110
of that black hat evildoer, Cryptonic Override.

83
00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:21.896
But tonight, I'm going to jack in

84
00:03:21.896 --> 00:03:23.930
(laughter)

85
00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:25.788
to their mainframe

86
00:03:25.788 --> 00:03:29.859
and expose them to the world wide world.

87
00:03:29.859 --> 00:03:31.620
(keyboard clicking) Here we go.

88
00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:34.630
Jamming the matrix, hashing the DDR.

89
00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:37.360
What, I've been sliced?

90
00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:40.273
CRYPTONIC OVERRIDE (V.O.): Aw, so close, Black Willow,

91
00:03:40.273 --> 00:03:44.898
but I, Cryptonic Override, am also using NordVPN.

92
00:03:44.898 --> 00:03:46.470
They have a promo going on right now

93
00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:49.600
which gives you 70% off a three-year plan

94
00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:52.640
and one extra month for free.

95
00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:57.293
Oh well, have a slice day. (laughs)

96
00:03:57.293 --> 00:03:59.330
SAM: Ah, I failed.

97
00:03:59.330 --> 00:04:01.010
Or did I?

98
00:04:01.010 --> 00:04:03.510
Computer, reload that audio clip

99
00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:06.494
but retro-flop the transmish.

100
00:04:06.494 --> 00:04:07.780
CRYPTONIC OVERRIDE (V.O.): [Fragmented] Have a slice day.

101
00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:09.760
SAM: Okay, now un-route the bus map

102
00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:11.542
and quantize the Fraggle Rock.

103
00:04:11.542 --> 00:04:13.430
(zapping)

104
00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:14.370
Closer.

105
00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:17.880
Now backdate the disco dongle and enhance.

106
00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:19.844
CRYPTONIC OVERRIDE (V.O.)" Have a slice day,

107
00:04:19.844 --> 00:04:21.870
slice, slice, sli-sli-slice.

108
00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:25.270
LAURA (V.O.): Have a slice day. (laughs)

109
00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:28.303
SAM: Wait, Cryptonic Override is...

110
00:04:28.303 --> 00:04:30.910
Laura Bailey?!

111
00:04:30.910 --> 00:04:32.612
ASHLEY: What?!
TRAVIS: Whoa!

112
00:04:32.612 --> 00:04:33.640
SAM: (screaming)

113
00:04:33.640 --> 00:04:35.970
LAURA: You cracked my code, Black Willow.

114
00:04:35.970 --> 00:04:38.720
Let's settle this the way all leet hackzors do,

115
00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:40.519
with a head-to-head hack off.

116
00:04:40.519 --> 00:04:43.050
SAM: (gasping)
LAURA: Do you accept?

117
00:04:43.050 --> 00:04:45.696
SAM: 0111001,

118
00:04:45.696 --> 00:04:49.432
which is binary for yes.

119
00:04:49.432 --> 00:04:52.238
LAURA: Ready, set, hack!

120
00:04:52.238 --> 00:04:54.060
(keyboards clicking)

121
00:04:54.060 --> 00:04:56.730
SAM: Oh, you're putting spyware on my aux interface?

122
00:04:56.730 --> 00:05:00.005
Try re-troglodyting the CD-ROM.

123
00:05:00.005 --> 00:05:02.940
LAURA: Oh, a triple-ask encounter virus?

124
00:05:02.940 --> 00:05:06.188
1995 called, Sandra Bullock wants her moves back.

125
00:05:06.188 --> 00:05:08.574
(keyboards clicking)
(laughter)

126
00:05:08.574 --> 00:05:10.000
Oh, you're trying to scramble my jumbotron?

127
00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:10.980
Yeah, good luck.

128
00:05:10.980 --> 00:05:14.460
It's password protected.
It's swordfish.

129
00:05:14.460 --> 00:05:16.628
It's always swordfish.
Damn it.

130
00:05:16.628 --> 00:05:18.315
(laughter)

131
00:05:18.315 --> 00:05:20.165
(groans) No, you're gleaming my cube!

132
00:05:21.362 --> 00:05:24.500
That's right, Black Willow, you're going down--

133
00:05:24.500 --> 00:05:26.040
huh?

134
00:05:26.040 --> 00:05:28.100
We, we both got sliced?

135
00:05:28.100 --> 00:05:31.250
Simul-sliced.
But by, by who?

136
00:05:31.250 --> 00:05:33.570
How?
Oh my god.

137
00:05:33.570 --> 00:05:35.470
The ultra codex.

138
00:05:35.470 --> 00:05:38.340
It's, it's going to infect the whole world.

139
00:05:38.340 --> 00:05:40.700
Which means we're going to have to--

140
00:05:40.700 --> 00:05:42.550
Hack the planet.

141
00:05:44.090 --> 00:05:46.360

142
00:05:48.310 --> 00:05:52.010

Matt?
Hack to you.

147
00:06:02.043 --> 00:06:04.552
(laughter)

148
00:06:04.552 --> 00:06:06.442
I think you mean if, if.

149
00:06:06.442 --> 00:06:09.613
(talking over each other)
(laughter)

150
00:06:09.613 --> 00:06:11.434
Laura Bailey.
Laura Bailey.

151
00:06:11.434 --> 00:06:12.680
(cheering)

152
00:06:12.680 --> 00:06:15.672
I'm not going to lie, now I'm invested.

153
00:06:15.672 --> 00:06:18.467
(laughter)

154
00:06:18.467 --> 00:06:19.890
What is the ultra codex, Matt?

155
00:06:19.890 --> 00:06:21.900
You don't know.
I don't know.

156
00:06:21.900 --> 00:06:23.786
Who does, who does?
It's a new top ten.

157
00:06:23.786 --> 00:06:25.610
That was just well done.

158
00:06:25.610 --> 00:06:28.448
Do we have any time left to play D&amp;D, though?

159
00:06:28.448 --> 00:06:29.281
(laughter)

160
00:06:29.281 --> 00:06:30.114
We'll try and squeeze it in.

161
00:06:30.114 --> 00:06:31.773
Okay.
Well.

162
00:06:31.773 --> 00:06:32.780
The planet needs to be hacked.

163
00:06:32.780 --> 00:06:34.510
Yeah.
We better--

164
00:06:34.510 --> 00:06:37.220
Troglodyte got me.
I can't even.

165
00:06:37.220 --> 00:06:39.380
Swordfish hurt.
Thank you, Sam,

166
00:06:39.380 --> 00:06:42.600
thank you, Laura, and thank you, NordVPN for sponsoring us.

167
00:06:42.600 --> 00:06:44.510
Simul-slice?
Simul-slice.

168
00:06:44.510 --> 00:06:46.750
Simul-slice was pretty good.
It's hardcore.

169
00:06:46.750 --> 00:06:48.310
It's a dangerous world.
Leap.

170
00:06:48.310 --> 00:06:49.900
So, those are the announcements.

171
00:06:49.900 --> 00:06:51.510
Unless anyone else has anything else they want to mention,

172
00:06:51.510 --> 00:06:53.240
I think that's the end of our list

173
00:06:53.240 --> 00:06:55.750
and we can jump into tonight's session.

174
00:06:55.750 --> 00:06:58.700
So, let's go ahead and jump into

175
00:06:58.700 --> 00:07:00.450
tonight's episode of Critical Role.

176
00:07:02.013 --> 00:07:04.957
(growling)

177
00:07:04.957 --> 00:07:07.078
(water bubbling)

178
00:07:07.078 --> 00:07:09.245

And welcome back.

209
00:08:43.726 --> 00:08:47.638
So, we'll have a Laura Bailey here now, there she is.

210
00:08:47.638 --> 00:08:48.774
(cheering)

211
00:08:48.774 --> 00:08:50.103
Welcome back, welcome back.

212
00:08:50.103 --> 00:08:52.597
My l33t gear off.
I understand.

213
00:08:52.597 --> 00:08:55.985
Don't want to lose your focus.

214
00:08:55.985 --> 00:09:00.516
So last we left off, The Mighty Nein

215
00:09:00.516 --> 00:09:03.039
has been working between the Dwendalian Empire

216
00:09:03.039 --> 00:09:06.161
and the Kryn Dynasty to try and arrange some sort of

217
00:09:06.161 --> 00:09:08.891
negotiation to bring us to a semblance of

218
00:09:08.891 --> 00:09:11.223
peace talks between these two places.

219
00:09:11.223 --> 00:09:13.388
You were given the option by King Dwendal

220
00:09:13.388 --> 00:09:16.450
to essentially clear the slate of what could be

221
00:09:16.450 --> 00:09:18.972
some problematic behavior from their perspective

222
00:09:18.972 --> 00:09:22.450
in your dealings with the Dynasty by arranging this.

223
00:09:22.450 --> 00:09:24.302
You went ahead and ran some errands,

224
00:09:24.302 --> 00:09:28.116
fought some people in a basement of a butchery,

225
00:09:28.116 --> 00:09:32.521
ordered some musical instruments,

226
00:09:32.521 --> 00:09:36.359
and then eventually made your way back to Rosohna

227
00:09:36.359 --> 00:09:41.168
where you checked into your Xhorhaus in Xhorhas,

228
00:09:41.168 --> 00:09:45.019
met up with Shadowhand Essek, and made your way

229
00:09:45.019 --> 00:09:47.694
to the Bright Queen's throne room.

230
00:09:47.694 --> 00:09:50.354
There, you beseeched her, on behalf of the Dwendalian Empire

231
00:09:50.354 --> 00:09:52.818
and the relationship you already forged,

232
00:09:52.818 --> 00:09:57.552
to listen to what you had to say, what you've discovered,

233
00:09:57.552 --> 00:10:00.897
what you've accomplished, and what you were sent to do.

234
00:10:00.897 --> 00:10:04.855
Through some relatively persuasive arguments

235
00:10:04.855 --> 00:10:08.068
and some key notes made in the center

236
00:10:08.068 --> 00:10:12.010
of that chamber within the Lucid Bastion,

237
00:10:12.010 --> 00:10:13.940
you succeeded in convincing her to allow

238
00:10:13.940 --> 00:10:16.329
not only for it to happen but for you guys

239
00:10:16.329 --> 00:10:20.316
to be somewhat present during these negotiations.

240
00:10:20.316 --> 00:10:24.437
You were sent to return this information onward to

241
00:10:24.437 --> 00:10:28.888
the Dwendalian Empire and an arrangement will be made

242
00:10:28.888 --> 00:10:32.741
at some point in the future where these will take place,

243
00:10:32.741 --> 00:10:36.071
under the absolutely necessary scenario

244
00:10:36.071 --> 00:10:38.819
that the ceasefire is maintained on both sides.

245
00:10:38.819 --> 00:10:41.284
There is very much a mutually assured

246
00:10:41.284 --> 00:10:46.151
reinstated conflict should anything poorly go down.

247
00:10:46.151 --> 00:10:51.151
You returned towards the Xhorhaus, you

248
00:10:52.130 --> 00:10:55.596
messaged an encroaching series of questions upon Essek,

249
00:10:55.596 --> 00:10:58.401
you went into your home, and after

250
00:10:58.401 --> 00:11:01.135
setting yourselves up in the early parts of the evening

251
00:11:01.135 --> 00:11:05.184
to have a night back in the house that you were gifted

252
00:11:05.184 --> 00:11:08.945
based on your deeds here in Rosohna,

253
00:11:08.945 --> 00:11:12.099
began to play a cacophony

254
00:11:12.099 --> 00:11:14.881
of musical something.

255
00:11:14.881 --> 00:11:17.062
Actually, you were doing pretty good

256
00:11:17.062 --> 00:11:18.600
along with the tiny piano and the--

257
00:11:18.600 --> 00:11:20.243
TALIESIN: There's only so much you can do with a--

258
00:11:20.243 --> 00:11:22.162
There's only so much you can do with a bone flute.

259
00:11:22.162 --> 00:11:23.775
I think Frumpkin rolled the highest.

260
00:11:23.775 --> 00:11:27.135
I think so, but Frumpkin usually does.

261
00:11:27.135 --> 00:11:31.375
When he's not killed in one hit. (laughs)

262
00:11:31.375 --> 00:11:33.171 line:15%
So,

263
00:11:33.171 --> 00:11:36.772 line:15%
after your loud performance display,

264
00:11:36.772 --> 00:11:39.009 line:15%
thrashing the ears of the neighborhood,

265
00:11:39.009 --> 00:11:40.863 line:15%
who had thought it calm and silent

266
00:11:40.863 --> 00:11:43.163 line:15%
for oh so long in your absence--

267
00:11:43.163 --> 00:11:44.597 line:15%
(laughs) Yeah.

268
00:11:44.597 --> 00:11:47.239 line:15%
And what would you like to do with the evening?

269
00:11:47.239 --> 00:11:50.332 line:15%
You're hungry, you're tired.

270
00:11:50.332 --> 00:11:52.289 line:15%
Essek isn't with us or anything, right?

271
00:11:52.289 --> 00:11:53.395 line:15%
Mm-mm.
No.

272
00:11:53.395 --> 00:11:54.739 line:15%
Do you want food, do you want to sleep?

273
00:11:54.739 --> 00:11:57.382 line:15%
You're hungry, you're tired, whatta you want?

274
00:11:57.382 --> 00:11:58.950 line:15%
(laughter)

275
00:11:58.950 --> 00:12:00.115 line:15%
Fjord's been drinking.

276
00:12:00.115 --> 00:12:02.056 line:15%
(laughter)

277
00:12:02.056 --> 00:12:03.537 line:15%
Damn that mass of new faces.

278
00:12:03.537 --> 00:12:04.827 line:15%
(laughter)

279
00:12:04.827 --> 00:12:06.550 line:15%
New face, new face!

280
00:12:07.518 --> 00:12:09.250 line:15%
Well, maybe before we go to bed, we should plot out

281
00:12:09.250 --> 00:12:13.170 line:15%
our next moves for the next few (sniffs) days, weeks.

282
00:12:14.210 --> 00:12:16.480 line:15%
We've done our duty here, we don't have to

283
00:12:16.480 --> 00:12:18.200 line:15%
hurry back to Rexxentrum, yeah?

284
00:12:18.200 --> 00:12:19.180 line:15%
Do we?
That's true.

285
00:12:19.180 --> 00:12:22.770 line:15%
I mean, are we, are we meant to contact

286
00:12:24.450 --> 00:12:28.410 line:15%
the Dwendal's people and tell them about the arrangement?

287
00:12:28.410 --> 00:12:30.530 line:15%
In time.
We probably should, yeah.

288
00:12:30.530 --> 00:12:32.880 line:15%
That will be the next thing and then probably

289
00:12:33.810 --> 00:12:36.930 line:15%
getting the ship in order, I guess.

290
00:12:36.930 --> 00:12:39.030 line:15%
Yes.
But there's no pressing,

291
00:12:39.030 --> 00:12:41.850 line:15%
like, we don't have to do that today, right?

292
00:12:41.850 --> 00:12:44.020 line:15%
Well, the longer we wait, the more of a chance

293
00:12:44.020 --> 00:12:46.020 line:15%
there is for something to slip and the--

294
00:12:47.400 --> 00:12:48.620 line:15%
Oh, right.
War to restart.

295
00:12:48.620 --> 00:12:49.880 line:15%
We have to let them know right away

296
00:12:49.880 --> 00:12:51.890 line:15%
to, like, hey, not fight.
Yes, yes,

297
00:12:51.890 --> 00:12:53.090 line:15%
we do have to let them know right away.

298
00:12:53.090 --> 00:12:55.660 line:15%
Yeah, so we should contact them now, tonight?

299
00:12:55.660 --> 00:12:57.210 line:15%
Did I already do that?
I think we did that.

300
00:12:57.210 --> 00:12:59.940 line:15%
We did, you messaged--
Ludinus.

301
00:12:59.940 --> 00:13:01.850 line:15%
Oh, that's right, we did, we did.

302
00:13:01.850 --> 00:13:05.400 line:15%
Hey, we're so, I remember that, of course.

303
00:13:05.400 --> 00:13:08.710 line:15%
I say we have a leisurely evening, a leisurely morning,

304
00:13:08.710 --> 00:13:12.290 line:15%
make our way back tomorrow.
To?

305
00:13:12.290 --> 00:13:15.887 line:15%
To deliver whatever other information we need to.

306
00:13:15.887 --> 00:13:18.310 line:15%
You have armor to pick up here.

307
00:13:19.298 --> 00:13:20.131 line:15%
(gasping)

308
00:13:20.131 --> 00:13:21.850 line:15%
Right?
Yes.

309
00:13:21.850 --> 00:13:22.960 line:15%
Yeah.
I do.

310
00:13:22.960 --> 00:13:25.440 line:15%
I forgot about that but I have to--

311
00:13:25.440 --> 00:13:26.600 line:15%
Do you have to finish paying for it?

312
00:13:26.600 --> 00:13:28.520 line:15%
Finish paying for it, which I think,

313
00:13:28.520 --> 00:13:30.450 line:15%
how much do I have left on it?

314
00:13:30.450 --> 00:13:32.340 line:15%
Believe it was about 2,000 gold left on that.

315
00:13:32.340 --> 00:13:37.270 line:15%
Yikes!
We can make that.

316
00:13:37.270 --> 00:13:38.290 line:15%
It is 2,000.

317
00:13:39.630 --> 00:13:43.290 line:15%
I've been keeping a little mental to do list.

318
00:13:43.290 --> 00:13:45.300 line:15%
Can I just run it through you guys and you can

319
00:13:45.300 --> 00:13:48.000 line:15%
tell me what's important on the to do list?

320
00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:48.960 line:15%
Totally.
Yeah, of course.

321
00:13:48.960 --> 00:13:53.090 line:15%
'Kay, there's Traveler Con.
Yeah, that's coming up soon.

322
00:13:53.090 --> 00:13:55.070 line:15%
How soon?
Weeks.

323
00:13:55.070 --> 00:13:57.700 line:15%
About five weeks, little over five weeks, maybe.

324
00:13:57.700 --> 00:13:59.350 line:15%
I have to make sure Orly's going to

325
00:13:59.350 --> 00:14:00.830 line:15%
be there when we get there.

326
00:14:00.830 --> 00:14:02.090 line:15%
I wonder how long it's going to take

327
00:14:02.090 --> 00:14:04.690 line:15%
to get from Nicodranas over there.

328
00:14:04.690 --> 00:14:06.970 line:15%
I'll have to contact Orly.
Do we need costumes?

329
00:14:06.970 --> 00:14:09.670 line:15%
Do we need anything, like, is there a uniform?

330
00:14:09.670 --> 00:14:10.700 line:15%
I don't know.

331
00:14:10.700 --> 00:14:15.210 line:15%
Assuming our ship survives this treaty talks.

332
00:14:15.210 --> 00:14:17.250 line:15%
Yeah.
Other things in my

333
00:14:17.250 --> 00:14:20.140 line:15%
mental list to do list that's written down,

334
00:14:20.140 --> 00:14:24.729 line:15%
Darrow, maybe scry on him.
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah,

335
00:14:24.729 --> 00:14:25.811 line:15%
we could do that.
Why?

336
00:14:25.811 --> 00:14:26.790 line:15%
Because he's got a client

337
00:14:26.790 --> 00:14:28.226 line:15%
that he won't tell us about!
And he won't tell us who

338
00:14:28.226 --> 00:14:30.810 line:15%
it is, obviously.
We could scry on him

339
00:14:30.810 --> 00:14:34.010 line:15%
and find out who the client is and get useful intel

340
00:14:34.010 --> 00:14:35.690 line:15%
or at least just fuck with him.

341
00:14:35.690 --> 00:14:37.320 line:15%
That's true, yeah.
Yeah.

342
00:14:37.320 --> 00:14:41.150 line:15%
All good options.
Vence, scry on him.

343
00:14:41.150 --> 00:14:43.270 line:15%
He's unscryable.
Mm.

344
00:14:43.270 --> 00:14:45.880 line:15%
With the necklace thingy.
Yeah.

345
00:14:45.880 --> 00:14:49.970 line:15%
Pride Silk at Pride's Call for Keona?

346
00:14:51.202 --> 00:14:52.519 line:15%
Yeah, that's kind of like a--

347
00:14:52.519 --> 00:14:53.900 line:15%
She wanted the worms--
Yeah,

348
00:14:53.900 --> 00:14:55.070 line:15%
It's kind of a bonus one.

349
00:14:55.070 --> 00:14:58.060 line:15%
You have to smuggle out the worms and then we could get paid

350
00:14:58.060 --> 00:14:59.720 line:15%
a decent amount of money.
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

351
00:14:59.720 --> 00:15:02.340 line:15%
But the worms are real big and real sacred

352
00:15:02.340 --> 00:15:04.954 line:15%
and they're real protective of them,

353
00:15:04.954 --> 00:15:07.920 line:15%
so it'd be like a worm heist.

354
00:15:07.920 --> 00:15:09.790 line:15%
That seems like plenty of areas

355
00:15:09.790 --> 00:15:11.640 line:15%
for us to fuck up--
Yeah.

356
00:15:11.640 --> 00:15:12.746 line:15%
Cool, though.
There are

357
00:15:12.746 --> 00:15:17.010 line:15%
Jagentoths in Shadycreek Run that exist.

358
00:15:17.010 --> 00:15:19.320 line:15%
Jagentoths.
I don't know.

359
00:15:19.320 --> 00:15:20.480 line:15%
I mean, we kind of of knew that, though.

360
00:15:20.480 --> 00:15:22.490 line:15%
Yeah, but I, did we need to go

361
00:15:22.490 --> 00:15:23.710 line:15%
and look it up or something?

362
00:15:23.710 --> 00:15:25.060 line:15%
Did we want to murder them?
I don't know.

363
00:15:25.060 --> 00:15:26.950 line:15%
Oh, I don't know.
Are we murdering people?

364
00:15:26.950 --> 00:15:28.510 line:15%
Maybe?
Are we--

365
00:15:28.510 --> 00:15:30.350 line:15%
Should I send them a message and let them know that

366
00:15:30.350 --> 00:15:32.104 line:15%
we're going to kill them?
I feel like,

367
00:15:32.104 --> 00:15:32.937 line:15%
(laughter)

368
00:15:32.937 --> 00:15:34.690 line:15%
that, (sputters)

369
00:15:35.730 --> 00:15:36.620 line:15%
okay, hang on, though.

370
00:15:36.620 --> 00:15:39.860 line:15%
Should we, are we above,

371
00:15:39.860 --> 00:15:43.650 line:15%
we've risen up in echelon in society, right,

372
00:15:43.650 --> 00:15:45.700 line:15%
to not murder people without cause, right?

373
00:15:45.700 --> 00:15:46.660 line:15%
Which society are you talking about?

374
00:15:46.660 --> 00:15:51.630 line:15%
The Dynasty or the Empire?
The, the human one, the--

375
00:15:51.630 --> 00:15:54.100 line:15%
I'm not human.
You know, where--

376
00:15:54.100 --> 00:15:56.860 line:15%
Speak for yourself.
Well, no, okay, the--

377
00:15:56.860 --> 00:15:59.190 line:15%
Civilization.
Thank you, civilization.

378
00:16:00.190 --> 00:16:04.200 line:15%
We are rather high profile everywhere now.

379
00:16:04.200 --> 00:16:05.850 line:15%
There's the, who?

380
00:16:05.850 --> 00:16:07.730 line:15%
We are well known--
We are?

381
00:16:07.730 --> 00:16:11.297 line:15%
We are The Mighty Nein of--
We are, we are.

382
00:16:11.297 --> 00:16:12.753 line:15%
(snapping)

383
00:16:12.753 --> 00:16:13.620 line:15%
The youth of the nation.
Couple other, couple other

384
00:16:13.620 --> 00:16:14.920 line:15%
options for us.
That's exactly

385
00:16:14.920 --> 00:16:17.364 line:15%
what I'm saying.
Caduceus has

386
00:16:17.364 --> 00:16:20.560 line:15%
some unfinished family business, I believe.

387
00:16:20.560 --> 00:16:22.900 line:15%
I figure that's in the direction of Traveler Con.

388
00:16:22.900 --> 00:16:27.310 line:15%
I figured I would hit you all up for accompanying me

389
00:16:27.310 --> 00:16:29.070 line:15%
to that.
On the way?

390
00:16:29.070 --> 00:16:32.150 line:15%
Either on the way or after, whichever is more convenient.

391
00:16:33.280 --> 00:16:35.470 line:15%
On the way would be wonderful.

392
00:16:35.470 --> 00:16:38.520 line:15%
I also wrote down snea snake for some reason.

393
00:16:38.520 --> 00:16:39.870 line:15%
Don't know what that means.

394
00:16:40.860 --> 00:16:41.693 line:15%
I don't know.

395
00:16:43.060 --> 00:16:45.808 line:15%
And we need basilisk oil for Pumat Sol.

396
00:16:45.808 --> 00:16:47.920 line:15%
(gasps) Oh.
Those are the outstanding

397
00:16:47.920 --> 00:16:49.192 line:15%
to do list items.
Did he say where

398
00:16:49.192 --> 00:16:51.710 line:15%
we were supposed to get that?
That's a good list.

399
00:16:51.710 --> 00:16:53.800 line:15%
That is a really good list.
Shit.

400
00:16:53.800 --> 00:16:56.000 line:15%
Where, you need to stop by somewhere on,

401
00:16:56.000 --> 00:16:57.550 line:15%
and where is it on our, if we're up

402
00:16:57.550 --> 00:17:00.130 line:15%
in Xhorhas and we're going down?

403
00:17:00.130 --> 00:17:02.940 line:15%
I'll probably scry a bit more, but it's a little past,

404
00:17:02.940 --> 00:17:05.100 line:15%
if I recall, if I--
The place that you've

405
00:17:05.100 --> 00:17:08.170 line:15%
been contemplating would be the possible location for this

406
00:17:08.170 --> 00:17:12.140 line:15%
is south of Xhorhas, to the east of Nicodranas.

407
00:17:12.140 --> 00:17:16.900 line:15%
It's, if you want to pull up a--
Pull up a map

408
00:17:16.900 --> 00:17:18.870 line:15%
A map of the Menagerie Coast, perhaps.

409
00:17:18.870 --> 00:17:21.530 line:15%
Is this the right one?
Uh, no.

410
00:17:21.530 --> 00:17:23.750 line:15%
Menagerie Coast and/or Xhorhas.

411
00:17:23.750 --> 00:17:24.750 line:15%
Want to set them both out?

412
00:17:24.750 --> 00:17:25.900 line:15%
We have so many maps.

413
00:17:27.050 --> 00:17:28.980 line:15%
How far down does the Xhorhas one go?

414
00:17:28.980 --> 00:17:31.110 line:15%
We need the Coast, there it is.

415
00:17:31.110 --> 00:17:32.296 line:15%
This is where,

416
00:17:32.296 --> 00:17:33.129 line:15%
(paper rustling)

417
00:17:33.129 --> 00:17:36.620 line:15%
(feet scuffling)
(chairs knocking)

418
00:17:36.620 --> 00:17:37.660 line:15%
that is where you're thinking,

419
00:17:37.660 --> 00:17:39.040
the Whitedawn Lagoon, and--

420
00:17:40.580 --> 00:17:42.180
Whitedawn, there we are.

421
00:17:42.180 --> 00:17:44.710
This would link approximately about

422
00:17:46.270 --> 00:17:47.103
there,

423
00:17:48.410 --> 00:17:50.130
in this vicinity.

424
00:17:50.130 --> 00:17:52.440
Can I invent a Thomas guide?

425
00:17:52.440 --> 00:17:55.100
I was just laughing at that.
I so felt that.

426
00:17:55.100 --> 00:17:56.450
I felt it, I felt it from you.

427
00:17:56.450 --> 00:17:59.320 line:15%
So, the negotiation, the location

428
00:17:59.320 --> 00:18:01.470 line:15%
where you had it agreed upon, which was

429
00:18:01.470 --> 00:18:04.150 line:15%
between the Whitedawn Lagoon and Nicodranas--

430
00:18:04.150 --> 00:18:06.330 line:15%
Okay.
Which is

431
00:18:06.330 --> 00:18:09.510 line:15%
just south of the border between Xhorhas and the Empire.

432
00:18:09.510 --> 00:18:10.679 line:15%
Okay.

433
00:18:10.679 --> 00:18:12.080 line:15%
(paper rustling)

434
00:18:12.080 --> 00:18:13.140 line:15%
So, it's kind of either,

435
00:18:13.140 --> 00:18:14.390 line:15%
depending on where you start,

436
00:18:14.390 --> 00:18:18.420 line:15%
wherever your ship picks you up, either you go there before,

437
00:18:19.897 --> 00:18:20.890 line:15%
if you're coming from Xhorhas' direction,

438
00:18:20.890 --> 00:18:22.760 line:15%
or go there after if you're coming from Nicodranas,

439
00:18:22.760 --> 00:18:24.840 line:15%
it'd be like your easiest one.
Go to--

440
00:18:24.840 --> 00:18:26.020 line:15%
It's up to you.
Go to Xhorhas.

441
00:18:26.020 --> 00:18:29.160 line:15%
That, we could do that, I would appreciate that.

442
00:18:29.160 --> 00:18:30.360 line:15%
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Not going to pretend

443
00:18:30.360 --> 00:18:33.085 line:15%
I'm not a little nervous, but yeah.

444
00:18:33.085 --> 00:18:33.918 line:15%
(knocking)

445
00:18:33.918 --> 00:18:35.390 line:15%
Hit your place on the way down to--

446
00:18:35.390 --> 00:18:36.640 line:15%
Oh, someone starts knocking on the door.

447
00:18:36.640 --> 00:18:37.640 line:15%
There's a knock at the door.

448
00:18:37.640 --> 00:18:38.473 line:15%
Who is--
Wait,

449
00:18:38.473 --> 00:18:39.490 line:15%
do we need to hide anything?

450
00:18:39.490 --> 00:18:40.750 line:15%
Is anything out that's illegal?

451
00:18:40.750 --> 00:18:41.790 line:15%
Like, beside ourselves?

452
00:18:41.790 --> 00:18:43.150 line:15%
I'm going to go to the door.

453
00:18:43.150 --> 00:18:44.630 line:15%
Mmkay.

454
00:18:44.630 --> 00:18:46.620 line:15%
You go ahead and peek through

455
00:18:46.620 --> 00:18:49.400 line:15%
the curtain there in the front and you see behind it

456
00:18:49.400 --> 00:18:52.290 line:15%
the familiar visage of Essek, the Shadowhand.

457
00:18:52.290 --> 00:18:54.170 line:15%
Oh, hey.
We just saw you.

458
00:18:54.170 --> 00:18:55.870 line:15%
Opening the door.
Ting-a-ding-ding-ding.

459
00:18:55.870 --> 00:18:57.970 line:15%
Thank you.
Is this a noise complaint?

460
00:18:57.970 --> 00:19:00.130 line:15%
No, it's, it is not a noise complaint.

461
00:19:03.030 --> 00:19:04.302 line:15%
I just, ah,

462
00:19:04.302 --> 00:19:06.885 line:15%
(gentle music)

463
00:19:08.340 --> 00:19:11.420 line:15%
if you would have a guest for dinner perhaps?

464
00:19:11.420 --> 00:19:13.620 line:15%
Oh.
Come on in, Essek,

465
00:19:13.620 --> 00:19:14.710 line:15%
we invited you before.

466
00:19:14.710 --> 00:19:16.200 line:15%
Come, come, come.
I thought about it.

467
00:19:16.200 --> 00:19:19.160 line:15%
I hadn't really, you know, done something like this

468
00:19:19.160 --> 00:19:20.740 line:15%
in awhile and perhaps it is--

469
00:19:23.010 --> 00:19:24.360 line:15%
something I should do.

470
00:19:25.460 --> 00:19:27.246 line:15%
Insight check.
Oh yeah.

471
00:19:27.246 --> 00:19:30.470 line:15%
Make an insight check.
"Do I, do I believe him?"

472
00:19:30.470 --> 00:19:32.800 line:15%
is what she wants to say.
Does he have,

473
00:19:32.800 --> 00:19:34.010 line:15%
do I believe him with an

474
00:19:34.010 --> 00:19:35.000 line:15%
insight check?
I know,

475
00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:37.390 line:15%
make an insight check.
Did he bring the wine?

476
00:19:37.390 --> 00:19:38.250 line:15%
Actually, he did.
Ah.

477
00:19:38.250 --> 00:19:41.710 line:15%
He takes it out from under his cloak and hands it over.

478
00:19:41.710 --> 00:19:44.710 line:15%
This is Solvia Grove's Diamond Plum Wine.

479
00:19:44.710 --> 00:19:46.740 line:15%
Oh.
He didn't even notice--

480
00:19:46.740 --> 00:19:48.366 line:15%
I'll decant it right away.

481
00:19:48.366 --> 00:19:50.240 line:15%
(laughter)

482
00:19:50.240 --> 00:19:51.940 line:15%
Yeah, natural 20.
Natural 20?

483
00:19:52.943 --> 00:19:54.330 line:15%
(chair scraping)

484
00:19:54.330 --> 00:19:55.163 line:15%
Holy.
All right.

485
00:19:55.163 --> 00:19:58.060 line:15%
He has do a little spin on the way over for a natural 20.

486
00:19:58.060 --> 00:20:00.140 line:15%
Wow, wow.
This whisper is

487
00:20:00.140 --> 00:20:02.460 line:15%
brought to you by--
NordVPN.

488
00:20:02.460 --> 00:20:05.400 line:15%
They can protect you on the internet.

489
00:20:05.400 --> 00:20:07.340 line:15%
Nothing can protect us from the dangers

490
00:20:07.340 --> 00:20:09.270 line:15%
that abound in Wildemount, but--

491
00:20:09.270 --> 00:20:12.280 line:15%
If you don't split-slicers.
Split-slicers?

492
00:20:12.280 --> 00:20:14.690 line:15%
Simul-slicers?
That's hard.

493
00:20:14.690 --> 00:20:16.210 line:15%
I was like, "This isn't it."

494
00:20:16.210 --> 00:20:18.121 line:15%
Also, that's very hard to say.

495
00:20:18.121 --> 00:20:18.954 line:15%
(laughter)

496
00:20:18.954 --> 00:20:19.787 line:15%
Spit-slicers.

497
00:20:19.787 --> 00:20:20.620 line:15%
This is why Laura got the job.

498
00:20:20.620 --> 00:20:21.790 line:15%
(laughter)

499
00:20:21.790 --> 00:20:23.560 line:15%
I really, I mean, it was a bad audition.

500
00:20:23.560 --> 00:20:24.790 line:15%
I was having a bad day.

501
00:20:24.790 --> 00:20:26.249 line:15%
"This is hard to say."

502
00:20:26.249 --> 00:20:27.621 line:15%
(laughter)

503
00:20:27.621 --> 00:20:29.130 line:15%
(throat clearing)

504
00:20:29.130 --> 00:20:30.090 line:15%
My apologies.

505
00:20:30.090 --> 00:20:31.160 line:15%
And you watch as he like,

506
00:20:31.160 --> 00:20:33.340 line:15%
after stepping into the chamber

507
00:20:33.340 --> 00:20:35.680 line:15%
and handing off the bottle of wine,

508
00:20:35.680 --> 00:20:39.440 line:15%
he (blows) stops hovering and lands on his feet

509
00:20:39.440 --> 00:20:42.530 line:15%
and unfastens the mantle--
Oh, we're going to see behind

510
00:20:42.530 --> 00:20:43.890 line:15%
the curtain.
His body?

511
00:20:43.890 --> 00:20:45.888 line:15%
Since we've never seen his body before.

512
00:20:45.888 --> 00:20:47.622 line:15%
(laughter)

513
00:20:47.622 --> 00:20:48.983 line:15%
It's like a reverse Krang.

514
00:20:48.983 --> 00:20:51.790 line:15%
(laughter)

515
00:20:51.790 --> 00:20:53.560 line:15%
Don't Google reverse Krang, by the way.

516
00:20:53.560 --> 00:20:56.230 line:15%
(laughter)

517
00:20:56.230 --> 00:20:57.803 line:15%
I did that once, in college.

518
00:20:57.803 --> 00:20:59.360 line:15%
(laughter)

519
00:20:59.360 --> 00:21:01.620 line:15%
But no, he removes the mantle and sets it on

520
00:21:01.620 --> 00:21:04.440 line:15%
one of the chairs in the foyer area of the Xhorhaus

521
00:21:04.440 --> 00:21:08.080 line:15%
and he's dressed in a nice, comfortable clothes,

522
00:21:08.080 --> 00:21:10.116 line:15%
well-trimmed--
Juicy Couture. (laughs)

523
00:21:10.116 --> 00:21:11.321 line:15%
(laughter)

524
00:21:11.321 --> 00:21:12.293 line:15%
Yeah, it's just--

525
00:21:12.293 --> 00:21:13.126 line:15%
(laughter)

526
00:21:13.126 --> 00:21:14.290 line:15%
Just says juicy on the ass.

527
00:21:14.290 --> 00:21:15.127 line:15%
Yup.

528
00:21:15.127 --> 00:21:15.960 line:15%
(laughter)

529
00:21:15.960 --> 00:21:16.830 line:15%
It's from the Rosohna, it was

530
00:21:16.830 --> 00:21:20.070 line:15%
Victoria's Secret, comfortable on.

531
00:21:20.070 --> 00:21:23.770 line:15%
No, it's actually not, not too different

532
00:21:23.770 --> 00:21:26.860 line:15%
from your Xhorhasian outfit as you had it tailored,

533
00:21:26.860 --> 00:21:29.320 line:15%
the design of which you requested is loosely based

534
00:21:29.320 --> 00:21:31.120 line:15%
on similar designs you've seen around the city

535
00:21:31.120 --> 00:21:33.670 line:15%
and his is more of a designer version of that,

536
00:21:33.670 --> 00:21:36.371 line:15%
but comfortable and sleek--
Designer, though.

537
00:21:36.371 --> 00:21:37.204 line:15%
It would be.
Fancy, he's fancy.

538
00:21:37.204 --> 00:21:38.037 line:15%
He's fancy.

539
00:21:38.037 --> 00:21:39.540 line:15%
Do you float all the time?

540
00:21:39.540 --> 00:21:40.770 line:15%
I'm sorry, I called it float.

541
00:21:40.770 --> 00:21:43.110 line:15%
It just seems you're always gliding.

542
00:21:44.160 --> 00:21:45.420 line:15%
Not all the time.

543
00:21:45.420 --> 00:21:48.680 line:15%
For me, it's more of a, (sighs)

544
00:21:48.680 --> 00:21:51.890 line:15%
I don't know, it's an expectation, I guess.

545
00:21:51.890 --> 00:21:53.280 line:15%
People expect it of you?

546
00:21:54.220 --> 00:21:55.690 line:15%
When you're young and impetuous,

547
00:21:55.690 --> 00:21:57.570 line:15%
you tend to do things to try and impress people

548
00:21:57.570 --> 00:22:01.110 line:15%
and then once you've set a sort of expectation

549
00:22:01.110 --> 00:22:04.497 line:15%
for a presentation, you have to maintain it.

550
00:22:04.497 --> 00:22:05.330 line:15%
(chuckling)

551
00:22:05.330 --> 00:22:07.070 line:15%
It's your gimmick!
More or less.

552
00:22:07.070 --> 00:22:10.780 line:15%
So, people just expect you to float everywhere?

553
00:22:10.780 --> 00:22:12.440 line:15%
Yes.
Does it make you tired?

554
00:22:13.771 --> 00:22:14.850 line:15%
Not particularly.
I mean,

555
00:22:14.850 --> 00:22:16.060 line:15%
walking makes you tired, if you

556
00:22:16.060 --> 00:22:17.130 line:15%
think about it.
Can you make, yeah,

557
00:22:17.130 --> 00:22:19.160 line:15%
can you make anyone float?

558
00:22:19.160 --> 00:22:21.130 line:15%
Or it's just yourself?
I mean,

559
00:22:21.970 --> 00:22:25.240 line:15%
via certain incantations, of course, but this is

560
00:22:25.240 --> 00:22:29.250 line:15%
more of just a developed for myself type trick.

561
00:22:29.250 --> 00:22:31.040 line:15%
Gimmick, if you will.
Bringing out some wine.

562
00:22:31.040 --> 00:22:32.960 line:15%
Here you go.
It still needs more time

563
00:22:32.960 --> 00:22:34.600 line:15%
to air it.
I'm

564
00:22:34.600 --> 00:22:36.640 line:15%
going to go get everything going in the kitchen.

565
00:22:36.640 --> 00:22:38.340 line:15%
I'll have everything up and running

566
00:22:38.340 --> 00:22:39.770 line:15%
real quick.
In for a treat.

567
00:22:39.770 --> 00:22:43.000 line:15%
Caduceus is going to cook.
I'm very excited.

568
00:22:43.000 --> 00:22:43.833 line:15%
Thank you very much.

569
00:22:43.833 --> 00:22:45.540 line:15%
Come into the dining room.

570
00:22:45.540 --> 00:22:46.960 line:15%
We have a dining room, right?
So are you single?

571
00:22:46.960 --> 00:22:47.810 line:15%
Do you have kids?

572
00:22:47.810 --> 00:22:49.280 line:15%
What's your last name?
Let's sit down

573
00:22:49.280 --> 00:22:51.154 line:15%
and do some small talk first.
Okay, come on in.

574
00:22:51.154 --> 00:22:53.318 line:15%
Oh, sit down.
I'll build a fire.

575
00:22:53.318 --> 00:22:54.580 line:15%
(chuckling)

576
00:22:54.580 --> 00:22:56.870 line:15%
Oh, I'll start heating up the hot tub just in case later.

577
00:22:56.870 --> 00:22:58.450 line:15%
Okay.
It takes like an hour to--

578
00:22:59.364 --> 00:23:00.550 line:15%
Very presumptuous.
Yes.

579
00:23:02.030 --> 00:23:04.710 line:15%
Where you from?
Here.

580
00:23:04.710 --> 00:23:06.250 line:15%
Are you married?
No.

581
00:23:07.460 --> 00:23:09.238 line:15%
What's your mother's name?

582
00:23:09.238 --> 00:23:10.071 line:15%
(laughter)

583
00:23:10.071 --> 00:23:12.400 line:15%
Well, my mother's name is

584
00:23:15.890 --> 00:23:19.630 line:15%
Deirta Thelyss, she is the Umavi of my den.

585
00:23:20.740 --> 00:23:22.488 line:15%
Umavi.
Oh, wow.

586
00:23:22.488 --> 00:23:24.012 line:15%
(paper rustling)

587
00:23:24.012 --> 00:23:25.770 line:15%
What was your last name again?

588
00:23:25.770 --> 00:23:27.280 line:15%
Thelyss.
Which den? Thelyss Den.

589
00:23:27.280 --> 00:23:28.830 line:15%
Thelyss, Den Thelyss.
Yes.

590
00:23:29.771 --> 00:23:30.700 line:15%
Den Thelyss.
One of

591
00:23:30.700 --> 00:23:33.830 line:15%
the multitude of dens. (chuckles)

592
00:23:33.830 --> 00:23:35.610 line:15%
Shall we sit?
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

593
00:23:35.610 --> 00:23:38.479 line:15%
Come on, have a seat on this couch.

594
00:23:38.479 --> 00:23:39.312 line:15%
(chuckling)

595
00:23:39.312 --> 00:23:40.280 line:15%
Assume we have couches.

596
00:23:41.873 --> 00:23:43.480 line:15%
Yeah, ottomans.
It's just chaise lounges.

597
00:23:43.480 --> 00:23:44.690 line:15%
Just everywhere.

598
00:23:44.690 --> 00:23:46.150 line:15%
So uncomfortable.
Please, faint on this

599
00:23:46.150 --> 00:23:48.990 line:15%
fainting couch.
I'm not imposing, am I?

600
00:23:48.990 --> 00:23:51.590 line:15%
No, we were just playing a concert for--

601
00:23:52.520 --> 00:23:54.650 line:15%
I was wondering what that sound was.

602
00:23:56.290 --> 00:23:59.180 line:15%
That was us.
It carries quite a distance.

603
00:23:59.180 --> 00:24:00.013 line:15%
Oh, yeah?
Yes.

604
00:24:00.013 --> 00:24:02.070 line:15%
Good.
It's how we focus.

605
00:24:03.010 --> 00:24:05.590 line:15%
After a huge meeting,

606
00:24:05.590 --> 00:24:06.930 line:15%
we play

607
00:24:07.870 --> 00:24:10.492 line:15%
and join our thoughts as one.

608
00:24:10.492 --> 00:24:12.742 line:15%
(laughter)

609
00:24:13.706 --> 00:24:18.290 line:15%
An unfamiliar custom, but--
It grows on you.

610
00:24:18.290 --> 00:24:20.690 line:15%
Hey, it is not unlike some things

611
00:24:20.690 --> 00:24:22.270 line:15%
I've seen in Asarius.
Mm-hmm.

612
00:24:23.390 --> 00:24:25.240 line:15%
Frumpkin jumps into his lap.
Oh.

613
00:24:26.970 --> 00:24:27.803 line:15%
Hello.

614
00:24:29.420 --> 00:24:30.253 line:15%
So,

615
00:24:31.220 --> 00:24:33.030 line:15%
what is the mood here

616
00:24:34.310 --> 00:24:35.310 line:15%
in the Dynasty here?

617
00:24:36.620 --> 00:24:37.970 line:15%
Right now, it is tension.

618
00:24:39.150 --> 00:24:43.530 line:15%
A little bit of frustration in the halting of what was

619
00:24:46.402 --> 00:24:49.850 line:15%
to be a very successful raid on Rexxentrum.

620
00:24:52.027 --> 00:24:53.246 line:15%
(laughter)

621
00:24:53.246 --> 00:24:54.454 line:15%
Oh.

622
00:24:54.454 --> 00:24:56.958 line:15%
(gentle music)

623
00:24:56.958 --> 00:24:59.375 line:15%
(whispering)

624
00:25:00.220 --> 00:25:01.053 line:15%
Tense.

625
00:25:04.660 --> 00:25:05.970 line:15%
That's primarily it.

626
00:25:05.970 --> 00:25:07.750 line:15%
This is so far removed from the front lines,

627
00:25:07.750 --> 00:25:10.830 line:15%
it's mostly just information disseminated via

628
00:25:11.750 --> 00:25:16.350 line:15%
word of mouth and the occasional street speaker, but

629
00:25:19.070 --> 00:25:20.170 line:15%
warfare makes for

630
00:25:24.740 --> 00:25:28.010 line:15%
not entirely pleasant opinions of the opposing side.

631
00:25:29.610 --> 00:25:32.710 line:15%
The tension in the throne room was fairly easy to read.

632
00:25:34.630 --> 00:25:36.980 line:15%
My wonder what the dens, the various dens,

633
00:25:36.980 --> 00:25:41.290 line:15%
think the people here.
That varies from den to den.

634
00:25:41.290 --> 00:25:44.180 line:15%
There are numerous, so, and it depends

635
00:25:44.180 --> 00:25:49.014 line:15%
on which opinion you want.
How about Den Thelyss?

636
00:25:49.014 --> 00:25:51.790 line:15%
Den Thelyss,

637
00:25:51.790 --> 00:25:55.100 line:15%
they would like very much to see

638
00:25:56.100 --> 00:25:58.950 line:15%
our nation established and respected

639
00:26:00.540 --> 00:26:02.820 line:15%
in the broader sense of the world.

640
00:26:02.820 --> 00:26:06.090 line:15%
Unfortunately, our most neighboring nation

641
00:26:06.090 --> 00:26:08.800 line:15%
tends to consider most everything to the east

642
00:26:11.850 --> 00:26:14.660 line:15%
savage landscapes and

643
00:26:14.660 --> 00:26:17.433 line:15%
dangerous cutthroats and

644
00:26:20.160 --> 00:26:22.400 line:15%
drow are killers and everything else, so.

645
00:26:22.400 --> 00:26:23.233 line:15%
And that is foolish.

646
00:26:23.233 --> 00:26:25.850 line:15%
That has not been our experience here.

647
00:26:25.850 --> 00:26:28.440 line:15%
But there are people on our end and many folks who assume

648
00:26:28.440 --> 00:26:32.000 line:15%
that the Empire is nothing but a bunch of

649
00:26:32.000 --> 00:26:36.900 line:15%
money-crazed, murderous villagers ready to kill each other

650
00:26:36.900 --> 00:26:39.530 line:15%
for a scrap of meat.
That is very true.

651
00:26:39.530 --> 00:26:41.630 line:15%
That's how everyone is there.

652
00:26:41.630 --> 00:26:43.150 line:15%
Lot's of--
Really?

653
00:26:43.150 --> 00:26:44.610 line:15%
No.
Jester, that's not,

654
00:26:44.610 --> 00:26:45.660 line:15%
that's--
Not true.

655
00:26:46.730 --> 00:26:48.880 line:15%
I care little for politics, to be honest.

656
00:26:50.710 --> 00:26:53.807 line:15%
But it seems you did as well, but circumstances

657
00:26:53.807 --> 00:26:56.560 line:15%
thrust us into spaces where we least expect.

658
00:26:57.663 --> 00:26:59.830 line:15%
What do you care for?

659
00:26:59.830 --> 00:27:01.610 line:15%
What are, you know, your hobbies

660
00:27:01.610 --> 00:27:03.160 line:15%
and things that you like to do?

661
00:27:04.520 --> 00:27:06.940 line:15%
Pet peeves?
Allergies?

662
00:27:08.430 --> 00:27:09.350 line:15%
Hopefully none of this.

663
00:27:09.350 --> 00:27:11.300 line:15%
A cheese and vegetable plate comes out.

664
00:27:12.462 --> 00:27:13.870 line:15%
You can see, like, the tension breaks

665
00:27:13.870 --> 00:27:15.320 line:15%
when you set it down and he's like,

666
00:27:15.320 --> 00:27:16.990 line:15%
"Thank you so much."
Right.

667
00:27:16.990 --> 00:27:18.810 line:15%
Main course coming, thank you, thank you.

668
00:27:18.810 --> 00:27:21.010 line:15%
Thank you, Caduceus.
This looks delicious.

669
00:27:21.010 --> 00:27:23.300 line:15%
Do you need help in there, Caduceus?

670
00:27:23.300 --> 00:27:24.900 line:15%
I'll be, I'll be just a minute, I'm fine.

671
00:27:24.900 --> 00:27:26.190 line:15%
That's a stay the fuck outta

672
00:27:26.190 --> 00:27:28.820 line:15%
the kitchen.
Yeah, I got that.

673
00:27:28.820 --> 00:27:29.816 line:15%
I'll cut you.

674
00:27:29.816 --> 00:27:32.066 line:15%
(laughter)

675
00:27:33.400 --> 00:27:35.680 line:15%
This is where Caduceus gets violent. (laughs)

676
00:27:35.680 --> 00:27:37.400 line:15%
You've asked me quite a few questions

677
00:27:37.400 --> 00:27:40.690 line:15%
and I'm willing to converse, but I'm curious,

678
00:27:40.690 --> 00:27:42.640 line:15%
I'm curious to get to know you as well.

679
00:27:46.150 --> 00:27:48.210 line:15%
What is it you want to achieve?

680
00:27:48.210 --> 00:27:49.180 line:15%
What are your goals?

681
00:27:49.180 --> 00:27:51.280 line:15%
What are the things you are looking to do?

682
00:27:52.520 --> 00:27:57.230 line:15%
I assume you weren't intending to bring a Beacon here

683
00:27:57.230 --> 00:28:02.230 line:15%
and throw yourself into the midst of this chaos, so

684
00:28:02.999 --> 00:28:04.887 line:15%
(chuckling)

685
00:28:04.887 --> 00:28:06.260 line:15%
what else it is pushes you forward?

686
00:28:06.260 --> 00:28:08.500 line:15%
Would it surprise you to know that perhaps a year ago,

687
00:28:08.500 --> 00:28:10.490 line:15%
we didn't even know of a Beacon

688
00:28:10.490 --> 00:28:12.290 line:15%
or of the Dynasty or of any of this?

689
00:28:13.730 --> 00:28:16.680 line:15%
Hm.
We knew of bacon,

690
00:28:16.680 --> 00:28:20.500 line:15%
just not of a Beacon.
Important distinction.

691
00:28:20.500 --> 00:28:23.210 line:15%
We all have individual goals and

692
00:28:24.916 --> 00:28:26.860 line:15%
issues that we're working on, but--

693
00:28:28.754 --> 00:28:29.587 line:15%
What about you?

694
00:28:31.095 --> 00:28:31.928 line:15%
Oh, me?
Yes.

695
00:28:32.762 --> 00:28:34.960 line:15%
Um--
Tell him.

696
00:28:35.850 --> 00:28:37.015 line:15%
Maybe he can do it.

697
00:28:37.015 --> 00:28:37.950 line:15%
I'll take a big sip of wine.

698
00:28:39.405 --> 00:28:40.238 line:15%
I,

699
00:28:41.160 --> 00:28:43.100 line:15%
I've just had some,

700
00:28:45.840 --> 00:28:47.250 line:15%
I'm not myself

701
00:28:48.700 --> 00:28:50.980 line:15%
and haven't been for awhile and was,

702
00:28:52.782 --> 00:28:57.782 line:15%
(sighs) like many of us, we're all sort of searching for,

703
00:28:57.810 --> 00:29:00.761 line:15%
well, many of us are searching for sort of

704
00:29:00.761 --> 00:29:03.720 line:15%
who we are, but mine is much more

705
00:29:05.040 --> 00:29:07.510 line:15%
odd because I know I'm not,

706
00:29:07.510 --> 00:29:11.810 line:15%
I'm not supposed to be like this and I'm trying to

707
00:29:11.810 --> 00:29:14.210 line:15%
change myself, physically.
Hm.

708
00:29:15.110 --> 00:29:16.860 line:15%
So, this is not your original form?

709
00:29:17.910 --> 00:29:22.740 line:15%
No, and actually, being in the throne room of your Queen,

710
00:29:24.780 --> 00:29:26.590 line:15%
it actually gave me a lot of hope.

711
00:29:26.590 --> 00:29:29.600 line:15%
I mean, seeing that people among you

712
00:29:29.600 --> 00:29:33.950 line:15%
and her and some of the den leaders, I suppose,

713
00:29:33.950 --> 00:29:38.950 line:15%
have changed form and shape many times over and put their

714
00:29:39.190 --> 00:29:42.000 line:15%
spirits into other bodies.
This is true.

715
00:29:42.910 --> 00:29:46.280 line:15%
It's actually given me a lot of hope.

716
00:29:47.870 --> 00:29:49.880 line:15%
They said that, when we were in there,

717
00:29:49.880 --> 00:29:52.490 line:15%
that you had to be, what was the term again?

718
00:29:52.490 --> 00:29:54.450 line:15%
Consecuted.
Consecuted.

719
00:29:54.450 --> 00:29:56.510 line:15%
That is a process, though I would say

720
00:29:56.510 --> 00:29:59.870 line:15%
it is one that requires a lot of patience.

721
00:30:01.721 --> 00:30:04.400 line:15%
It is a bit convoluted.
Does it take a long time?

722
00:30:04.400 --> 00:30:07.190 line:15%
The ritual itself takes about a day.

723
00:30:07.190 --> 00:30:10.800 line:15%
Is it painful?
The consecution is not.

724
00:30:10.800 --> 00:30:13.960 line:15%
The process of having to die to be consecuted

725
00:30:13.960 --> 00:30:17.490 line:15%
or returned to a new form, ah, depending,

726
00:30:17.490 --> 00:30:20.510 line:15%
can be painful, I'm sure.
How do they do it?

727
00:30:20.510 --> 00:30:22.990 line:15%
Well, they don't kill them once they're consecuted,

728
00:30:22.990 --> 00:30:24.440 line:15%
but when life comes to an end

729
00:30:25.909 --> 00:30:30.260 line:15%
and they are within a radial region of a Beacon,

730
00:30:30.260 --> 00:30:32.490 line:15%
then the soul is taken by the Beacon

731
00:30:32.490 --> 00:30:35.240 line:15%
and then implanted within a new life.

732
00:30:36.550 --> 00:30:38.470 line:15%
Have there ever been any instances

733
00:30:38.470 --> 00:30:41.820 line:15%
of outsiders having this done?

734
00:30:41.820 --> 00:30:46.410 line:15%
No one who has not been bound to the Beacons

735
00:30:46.410 --> 00:30:49.470 line:15%
via consecution has fallen into its net.

736
00:30:49.470 --> 00:30:51.380 line:15%
It is a requirement for the process.

737
00:30:51.380 --> 00:30:53.690 line:15%
Are you consecuted?
I am.

738
00:30:54.550 --> 00:30:56.050 line:15%
You're not excited about it?

739
00:30:57.180 --> 00:31:00.640 line:15%
I mean, prolonging life is divine.

740
00:31:02.870 --> 00:31:07.330 line:15%
But I think religion is a, (clicks tongue)

741
00:31:07.330 --> 00:31:10.247 line:15%
I would say a crutch to some spaces.

742
00:31:10.247 --> 00:31:12.701 line:15%
(fingers drumming)

743
00:31:12.701 --> 00:31:14.659 line:15%
(chuckles) I mean, the Dynasty is

744
00:31:14.659 --> 00:31:19.020 line:15%
so focused on this Luxon, this religion,

745
00:31:19.020 --> 00:31:22.410 line:15%
and the possibility of what it means,

746
00:31:24.100 --> 00:31:26.440 line:15%
but it's distracting them from what other good things

747
00:31:26.440 --> 00:31:28.920 line:15%
they could do with the time and focus, maybe.

748
00:31:28.920 --> 00:31:30.140 line:15%
And it's selective, right?

749
00:31:30.140 --> 00:31:32.530 line:15%
Not everyone in the Dynasty is consecuted,

750
00:31:32.530 --> 00:31:35.150 line:15%
so there are some that expire in this life

751
00:31:35.150 --> 00:31:36.550 line:15%
and that's the end for them.

752
00:31:38.540 --> 00:31:39.373 line:15%
There is a,

753
00:31:40.850 --> 00:31:42.540 line:15%
an expectation of advancement

754
00:31:42.540 --> 00:31:45.630 line:15%
within the faith to be consecuted.

755
00:31:45.630 --> 00:31:46.463 line:15%
I

756
00:31:48.040 --> 00:31:49.450 line:15%
really do not care for the

757
00:31:50.790 --> 00:31:52.970 line:15%
specific theology behind it,

758
00:31:52.970 --> 00:31:55.350 line:15%
but I was lucky enough and privileged enough

759
00:31:55.350 --> 00:31:59.020 line:15%
to be born within a den to where it was not questioned,

760
00:31:59.020 --> 00:32:01.160 line:15%
but--
So, it's reserved

761
00:32:01.160 --> 00:32:03.540 line:15%
for people within certain families.

762
00:32:03.540 --> 00:32:05.250 line:15%
Well, it's expended into those

763
00:32:05.250 --> 00:32:07.370 line:15%
that aren't part of the dens,

764
00:32:07.370 --> 00:32:10.440 line:15%
but they don't just consecute anyone

765
00:32:10.440 --> 00:32:12.920 line:15%
who steps into the Dynasty and requests it.

766
00:32:12.920 --> 00:32:16.770 line:15%
And you are, forgive me, on your first life?

767
00:32:16.770 --> 00:32:20.290 line:15%
Yes, I'm nearly the youngest of my den.

768
00:32:20.290 --> 00:32:21.560 line:15%
Forgive me if this is presumptuous.

769
00:32:21.560 --> 00:32:22.550 line:15%
How old are you?

770
00:32:24.826 --> 00:32:27.240 line:15%
I would be close to 120 years.

771
00:32:27.240 --> 00:32:29.690 line:15%
Yeah, the same for all of us, just a (trails off).

772
00:32:31.663 --> 00:32:34.490 line:15%
Do you have to be consecuted every single lifetime?

773
00:32:34.490 --> 00:32:37.170 line:15%
No, once you're consecuted, the process continues, yes.

774
00:32:37.170 --> 00:32:39.110 line:15%
For thousands of years, you're just there.

775
00:32:39.110 --> 00:32:41.740 line:15%
Well, until you die too far from a Beacon.

776
00:32:42.581 --> 00:32:44.498 line:15%
Ohh.

777
00:32:45.720 --> 00:32:47.660 line:15%
That's--
That's, that's a thing.

778
00:32:47.660 --> 00:32:50.330 line:15%
You see, that is why the Beacons are so important.

779
00:32:50.330 --> 00:32:52.890 line:15%
They allow the expansion of our civilization.

780
00:32:54.201 --> 00:32:55.034 line:15%
Right.
If a city

781
00:32:55.034 --> 00:32:58.010 line:15%
does not exist within some radius of a Beacon,

782
00:32:58.010 --> 00:33:01.070 line:15%
everyone within that city is unable to return.

783
00:33:01.070 --> 00:33:03.500 line:15%
And just to follow our thought experiment

784
00:33:03.500 --> 00:33:05.990 line:15%
with our friend Nott here, if she were

785
00:33:05.990 --> 00:33:08.870 line:15%
to be consecuted, she would need to remain here.

786
00:33:10.630 --> 00:33:11.600 line:15%
Well, you would have to ensure

787
00:33:11.600 --> 00:33:13.120 line:15%
that if you were to pass away,

788
00:33:14.330 --> 00:33:17.640 line:15%
it was within the radius of a beacon, yes.

789
00:33:17.640 --> 00:33:21.020 line:15%
But again, you would, she would be transferred to

790
00:33:21.020 --> 00:33:24.950 line:15%
a new body and a new, young life, not a current one.

791
00:33:24.950 --> 00:33:27.350 line:15%
Correct, and you would--
Like a baby?

792
00:33:27.350 --> 00:33:30.100 line:15%
Yes, and you would grow and age.

793
00:33:30.100 --> 00:33:31.960 line:15%
How old are you before you realize

794
00:33:31.960 --> 00:33:34.670 line:15%
you're the same person you were before?

795
00:33:34.670 --> 00:33:35.900 line:15%
A little bit into adolescence.

796
00:33:35.900 --> 00:33:37.910 line:15%
You begin to have dreams and visions

797
00:33:37.910 --> 00:33:40.240 line:15%
of memories of your previous life or lives

798
00:33:41.880 --> 00:33:46.240 line:15%
and you begin to seek out members of the Dynasty

799
00:33:47.790 --> 00:33:50.870 line:15%
to then bring you through this anamnesis process

800
00:33:50.870 --> 00:33:53.980 line:15%
in which you are to combine your current life's memories

801
00:33:53.980 --> 00:33:56.360 line:15%
with the personality's memories of your previous lives

802
00:33:56.360 --> 00:33:59.830 line:15%
to become one.
Yeah, that's--

803
00:33:59.830 --> 00:34:02.140 line:15%
Sounds very confusing.
I'm sure.

804
00:34:02.140 --> 00:34:04.040 line:15%
I've not done it myself.
But, like,

805
00:34:05.090 --> 00:34:07.840 line:15%
what's to keep somebody else from coming and say,

806
00:34:07.840 --> 00:34:11.240 line:15%
"Oh, I'm the Queen, I'm the Bright Queen's soul."

807
00:34:12.220 --> 00:34:13.920 line:15%
Well, those who would receive her

808
00:34:13.920 --> 00:34:17.330 line:15%
would then ask many questions that only

809
00:34:17.330 --> 00:34:19.410 line:15%
the Bright Queen would know the answer to.

810
00:34:19.410 --> 00:34:20.243 line:15%
I guess that makes sense.

811
00:34:20.243 --> 00:34:23.530 line:15%
Do you remember your previous life fully?

812
00:34:24.980 --> 00:34:26.690 line:15%
I don't know.

813
00:34:26.690 --> 00:34:29.440 line:15%
I have not undergone this process myself.

814
00:34:30.590 --> 00:34:33.750 line:15%
Has anyone, like, an adult been,

815
00:34:35.550 --> 00:34:39.500 line:15%
have you used an adult body before instead of a infant?

816
00:34:41.140 --> 00:34:43.130 line:15%
I think what he's saying is that a new life

817
00:34:43.130 --> 00:34:46.080 line:15%
is born and the soul is within it--

818
00:34:46.080 --> 00:34:48.000 line:15%
It is not of our choosing,

819
00:34:48.000 --> 00:34:49.650 line:15%
it is the choosing of the Beacon.

820
00:34:51.849 --> 00:34:53.616 line:15%
That's some Dalai Lama shit.
Wow.

821
00:34:53.616 --> 00:34:55.070 line:15%
I mean, we've had issues in the past where Beacons

822
00:34:55.070 --> 00:34:58.940 line:15%
and our soldiers were killed on foreign soil

823
00:35:00.250 --> 00:35:04.660 line:15%
and then souls were born in elements of the Empire.

824
00:35:04.660 --> 00:35:07.550 line:15%
We had one conflict about

825
00:35:08.710 --> 00:35:11.860 line:15%
13, 14 years ago on the northern side of the Empire

826
00:35:11.860 --> 00:35:15.400 line:15%
in which many of soldiers on both sides were killed.

827
00:35:15.400 --> 00:35:17.100 line:15%
And recently, some of those spirits

828
00:35:17.100 --> 00:35:21.880 line:15%
began to undergo anamnesis there, around Nogvurot

829
00:35:21.880 --> 00:35:25.770 line:15%
and as such, we helped the children return to the destiny--

830
00:35:25.770 --> 00:35:27.130 line:15%
Holy moly!
As such have now been

831
00:35:27.130 --> 00:35:31.030 line:15%
reintroduced into our society.
So, Empire kids

832
00:35:32.290 --> 00:35:37.290 line:15%
might turn 15 and be like, "Oh, shit, I'm a Kryn.

833
00:35:37.330 --> 00:35:38.430 line:15%
"I have to go back."

834
00:35:38.430 --> 00:35:40.260 line:15%
Under the rare conditions in which

835
00:35:41.967 --> 00:35:44.520 line:15%
a spirit that has been consecuted were to

836
00:35:44.520 --> 00:35:49.080 line:15%
die near a Beacon, away from the Dynasty.

837
00:35:49.080 --> 00:35:51.540 line:15%
That's why, do you remember, the cryers were going,

838
00:35:51.540 --> 00:35:53.640 line:15%
"Children are being stolen from Nogvurot"?

839
00:35:54.970 --> 00:35:57.380 line:15%
Mm, that would make sense.

840
00:35:58.585 --> 00:36:00.500 line:15%
A unique spin to the tale.

841
00:36:00.500 --> 00:36:02.110 line:15%
Stolen from Nogvurot?

842
00:36:02.110 --> 00:36:05.150 line:15%
So, they may have just awakened and left.

843
00:36:05.150 --> 00:36:06.390 line:15%
Fuck.
Wow.

844
00:36:06.390 --> 00:36:07.750 line:15%
Whoa, shit.

845
00:36:09.980 --> 00:36:11.790 line:15%
I wonder how old those children were.

846
00:36:11.790 --> 00:36:13.720 line:15%
Adolescents, I bet.
There's food.

847
00:36:14.612 --> 00:36:15.445 line:15%
Oh!
All right.

848
00:36:15.445 --> 00:36:18.160 line:15%
Oh, wow.
So, to your point,

849
00:36:18.160 --> 00:36:20.780 line:15%
it is possibly a way, though there is no

850
00:36:22.250 --> 00:36:24.530 line:15%
guarantee which body will find you

851
00:36:24.530 --> 00:36:26.710 line:15%
It could very well be another goblin,

852
00:36:26.710 --> 00:36:29.530 line:15%
it could be one of our fine drow, which is not so bad,

853
00:36:30.715 --> 00:36:32.540 line:15%
it could be all manner of creature.

854
00:36:33.400 --> 00:36:35.450 line:15%
If what you are seeking is some sort of a

855
00:36:37.960 --> 00:36:39.930 line:15%
transference to a new body,

856
00:36:39.930 --> 00:36:43.290 line:15%
I don't think that's within my purview.

857
00:36:43.290 --> 00:36:48.290 line:15%
Can you just turn this body into a different body?

858
00:36:48.550 --> 00:36:51.150 line:15%
I do not know of such magic myself, unfortunately.

859
00:36:52.080 --> 00:36:55.720 line:15%
There are rumors of extremely powerful

860
00:36:55.720 --> 00:36:59.440 line:15%
polymorph spells and incantations, but even those

861
00:36:59.440 --> 00:37:02.040 line:15%
have limitations that can be temporary or dispelled.

862
00:37:03.094 --> 00:37:05.300 line:15%
(throat clearing)

863
00:37:05.300 --> 00:37:07.510 line:15%
But if I hear anything, I will let you know.

864
00:37:08.470 --> 00:37:13.360 line:15%
If we hear of something, could we ask your aid--

865
00:37:13.360 --> 00:37:15.010 line:15%
If I can.
In deciphering it?

866
00:37:17.520 --> 00:37:18.353 line:15%
If I can.

867
00:37:19.910 --> 00:37:21.210 line:15%
So, you live alone, huh?

868
00:37:23.380 --> 00:37:24.213 line:15%
I do.

869
00:37:26.870 --> 00:37:31.010 line:15%
You mentioned that you felt like the Dynasty

870
00:37:31.010 --> 00:37:34.710 line:15%
could utilize its time for much better purposes.

871
00:37:35.580 --> 00:37:37.280 line:15%
What would you see the Dynasty do?

872
00:37:41.180 --> 00:37:43.220 line:15%
I would not focus so much on

873
00:37:43.220 --> 00:37:45.320 line:15%
pressing these religious beliefs

874
00:37:45.320 --> 00:37:48.470 line:15%
that are based on myth and interpretation.

875
00:37:50.340 --> 00:37:52.460 line:15%
I know gods exist because we have proof

876
00:37:52.460 --> 00:37:53.630 line:15%
and there are those who speak to them,

877
00:37:53.630 --> 00:37:56.830 line:15%
there are visions and miracles that happen.

878
00:37:56.830 --> 00:37:58.730 line:15%
But the Luxons do not speak to anyone.

879
00:37:59.580 --> 00:38:01.620 line:15%
It's a lot of religion based on assumption,

880
00:38:01.620 --> 00:38:03.550 line:15%
on existing scripture written by individuals

881
00:38:03.550 --> 00:38:05.366 line:15%
hundreds and hundreds of years ago.

882
00:38:05.366 --> 00:38:06.580 line:15%
(package rustling)

883
00:38:06.580 --> 00:38:08.490 line:15%
There is power in the Beacons

884
00:38:08.490 --> 00:38:10.690 line:15%
and dunamancy in itself is something unique.

885
00:38:12.780 --> 00:38:15.010 line:15%
That, I think, is worth pursuing.

886
00:38:17.230 --> 00:38:18.930 line:15%
The rest of this is a distraction.

887
00:38:19.995 --> 00:38:23.180 line:15%
Is that pursuit frowned upon or largely ignored?

888
00:38:23.180 --> 00:38:25.850 line:15%
Like a standard is kept and additional

889
00:38:25.850 --> 00:38:28.080 line:15%
knowledge not sought out?

890
00:38:29.270 --> 00:38:31.080 line:15%
It's not so much ignored more than

891
00:38:32.870 --> 00:38:34.260 line:15%
not as much of a priority.

892
00:38:37.409 --> 00:38:39.210 line:15%
It's like not knowing how deep the ocean is.

893
00:38:39.210 --> 00:38:40.820 line:15%
Indeed.
Do you know how deep

894
00:38:40.820 --> 00:38:43.330 line:15%
the ocean is?
It's pretty fucking deep.

895
00:38:43.330 --> 00:38:46.060 line:15%
And that is what I spend my time

896
00:38:46.060 --> 00:38:48.700 line:15%
toiling away, is to find those depths.

897
00:38:48.700 --> 00:38:53.420 line:15%
And there is so much, so much untapped possibility

898
00:38:54.615 --> 00:38:56.115 line:15%
in the utilization of Dunamis.

899
00:38:57.740 --> 00:39:01.400 line:15%
I, to answer your question of what it is I want to do.

900
00:39:03.030 --> 00:39:05.950 line:15%
And I believe you, you can understand this,

901
00:39:05.950 --> 00:39:08.290 line:15%
and I can see a similar spark in you, Caleb.

902
00:39:09.871 --> 00:39:11.521 line:15%
I want to unlock these mysteries.

903
00:39:12.540 --> 00:39:14.740 line:15%
I want to dive as deep as I can into that

904
00:39:14.740 --> 00:39:19.740 line:15%
ocean of the unknown and see what is possible.

905
00:39:19.741 --> 00:39:23.150 line:15%
Are you saying, are you saying you want to date Fjord?

906
00:39:23.150 --> 00:39:24.530 line:15%
I don't think that's what he's saying.

907
00:39:24.530 --> 00:39:26.420 line:15%
That isn't what I was saying.

908
00:39:26.420 --> 00:39:30.160 line:15%
I'm sorry, I was distracted by, there's cookies.

909
00:39:30.160 --> 00:39:32.140 line:15%
Yeah, and also the ocean talk.

910
00:39:32.140 --> 00:39:34.180 line:15%
Yeah, the ocean, dive deep into the ocean.

911
00:39:34.180 --> 00:39:36.360 line:15%
It's a metaphor.
Rip that open real fast.

912
00:39:36.360 --> 00:39:37.370 line:15%
Rip it, rip it.
Go for it.

913
00:39:37.370 --> 00:39:38.500 line:15%
I believe in you.
Get it.

914
00:39:38.500 --> 00:39:39.893 line:15%
Yeah.

915
00:39:39.893 --> 00:39:40.726 line:15%
(laughter)

916
00:39:40.726 --> 00:39:42.000 line:15%
He turns back to Caleb and says,

917
00:39:44.700 --> 00:39:47.160 line:15%
"To pursue beyond the limits of

918
00:39:47.160 --> 00:39:51.950 line:15%
"what you're told is capable, to seek the impossible,

919
00:39:53.280 --> 00:39:58.210 line:15%
"to do what every archmage before us has failed to do."

920
00:39:58.210 --> 00:39:59.460 line:15%
Anything is impossible.

921
00:40:00.820 --> 00:40:03.880 line:15%
You just have to look long enough and hard enough.

922
00:40:03.880 --> 00:40:06.480 line:15%
Indeed.
The things we've seen.

923
00:40:06.480 --> 00:40:09.720 line:15%
You don't strike me as having much of an appetite for war.

924
00:40:09.720 --> 00:40:12.727 line:15%
No, I have an appetite for knowledge.

925
00:40:14.500 --> 00:40:16.210 line:15%
(sighing)

926
00:40:16.210 --> 00:40:17.860 line:15%
Go back to the ocean metaphor

927
00:40:17.860 --> 00:40:20.050 line:15%
because it's kind of working.
Thank you.

928
00:40:22.850 --> 00:40:26.190 line:15%
You could also get crushed into oblivion

929
00:40:26.190 --> 00:40:30.960 line:15%
by several tons of weight at the bottom of the ocean

930
00:40:30.960 --> 00:40:35.960 line:15%
or, you know, consumed by some other scary being, like--

931
00:40:36.370 --> 00:40:37.320 line:15%
Uk'otoa.

932
00:40:38.440 --> 00:40:39.890 line:15%
Are you not--
That's still a thing?

933
00:40:39.890 --> 00:40:41.960 line:15%
Remotely humbled or afraid

934
00:40:42.980 --> 00:40:44.930 line:15%
of some of the unknowns you might find?

935
00:40:47.260 --> 00:40:50.500 line:15%
I am as afraid as anybody is facing into the unknown,

936
00:40:52.000 --> 00:40:53.990 line:15%
but that's what makes it worthwhile, is it not?

937
00:40:53.990 --> 00:40:56.690 line:15%
High risk, high reward.
Indeed.

938
00:40:56.690 --> 00:40:58.190 line:15%
But you can mitigate the risk.

939
00:40:59.330 --> 00:41:00.440 line:15%
That's actually an interesting

940
00:41:00.440 --> 00:41:01.273 line:15%
trade.
How?

941
00:41:01.273 --> 00:41:02.820 line:15%
How can you mitigate the risk?

942
00:41:02.820 --> 00:41:05.350 line:15%
Investigating your Luxon and the Beacons,

943
00:41:05.350 --> 00:41:09.030 line:15%
has anyone ever, I don't know, died researching it

944
00:41:09.030 --> 00:41:12.354 line:15%
or perhaps gazed in it too deeply, I don't know.

945
00:41:12.354 --> 00:41:15.640 line:15%
There have been those who have not understood

946
00:41:18.160 --> 00:41:19.510 line:15%
what they're capable of and reached

947
00:41:19.510 --> 00:41:21.640 line:15%
beyond their means too soon.

948
00:41:21.640 --> 00:41:24.430 line:15%
Their research was incomplete, they attempted to

949
00:41:26.310 --> 00:41:28.650 line:15%
bend the core elements of existence

950
00:41:28.650 --> 00:41:30.250 line:15%
before they were ready to do so.

951
00:41:31.120 --> 00:41:34.090 line:15%
And that is a lesson we all must learn from.

952
00:41:35.110 --> 00:41:38.170 line:15%
Maybe the lesson is that it's way too much power

953
00:41:38.170 --> 00:41:40.800 line:15%
for any one person to be fucking with.

954
00:41:40.800 --> 00:41:41.750 line:15%
This is possible.

955
00:41:42.750 --> 00:41:46.690 line:15%
But that's why you take care and that's why you work alone.

956
00:41:47.600 --> 00:41:49.860 line:15%
Only because Jester loves the details,

957
00:41:49.860 --> 00:41:51.850 line:15%
what happened to those people that

958
00:41:51.850 --> 00:41:56.470 line:15%
messed around with things sooner than they should have?

959
00:41:56.470 --> 00:42:00.030 line:15%
There are rumors of some that just vanished,

960
00:42:01.270 --> 00:42:05.710 line:15%
that either succeeded in finding some sort of

961
00:42:05.710 --> 00:42:08.780 line:15%
alteration to the planes of existence and never returned.

962
00:42:09.920 --> 00:42:13.330 line:15%
There is two tales I can think of off the top of my head

963
00:42:13.330 --> 00:42:14.440 line:15%
of those that wished to try and

964
00:42:14.440 --> 00:42:18.560 line:15%
use dunamancy to actually step

965
00:42:18.560 --> 00:42:21.110 line:15%
into the annals of history,

966
00:42:22.780 --> 00:42:25.282 line:15%
to step into the time before.

967
00:42:25.282 --> 00:42:26.820 line:15%
Oh.
Whoa, really?

968
00:42:27.730 --> 00:42:31.040 line:15%
And one of them returned--

969
00:42:31.040 --> 00:42:32.800 line:15%
What?
To scatter to dust.

970
00:42:34.120 --> 00:42:35.540 line:15%
It's possible,

971
00:42:37.040 --> 00:42:39.960 line:15%
but it seems to be extremely dangerous.

972
00:42:39.960 --> 00:42:41.360 line:15%
So, to answer your question,

973
00:42:42.310 --> 00:42:44.010 line:15%
there are things that are possible

974
00:42:44.980 --> 00:42:49.770 line:15%
but if we're careful and we take our time, who knows?

975
00:42:50.690 --> 00:42:54.660 line:15%
He is fucking with shit at his home by himself.

976
00:42:54.660 --> 00:42:56.060 line:15%
Is he?

977
00:42:56.060 --> 00:42:58.090 line:15%
Do I gleam, has he made this?
He killed his wife

978
00:42:58.090 --> 00:43:00.560 line:15%
with a time machine!
He's got some

979
00:43:00.560 --> 00:43:03.010 line:15%
H.G. Wells shit kicking.

980
00:43:03.010 --> 00:43:05.620 line:15%
Go ahead and make it, make an insight check.

981
00:43:05.620 --> 00:43:06.630 line:15%
Just going off of his,

982
00:43:06.630 --> 00:43:08.350 line:15%
"That's why you work alone."
Can I assist her in that?

983
00:43:08.350 --> 00:43:10.388 line:15%
Because I'm feeling that same way.

984
00:43:10.388 --> 00:43:11.689 line:15%
Okay,

985
00:43:11.689 --> 00:43:14.052 line:15%
assist, me and Fjord decide--

986
00:43:14.052 --> 00:43:15.190 line:15%
(talking over each other)

987
00:43:15.190 --> 00:43:17.020 line:15%
I'd say both you guys, if you guys are both checking,

988
00:43:17.020 --> 00:43:19.330 line:15%
it's both of your, this isn't a skill you necessarily

989
00:43:19.330 --> 00:43:21.730 line:15%
help somebody with for this particular instance.

990
00:43:22.757 --> 00:43:24.470 line:15%
(laughs) Eight.
Nine.

991
00:43:24.470 --> 00:43:25.320 line:15%
Come on.
Uh.

992
00:43:26.260 --> 00:43:27.200 line:15%
Oh wait.
16.

993
00:43:27.200 --> 00:43:29.420 line:15%
Insight, though, insight.

994
00:43:29.420 --> 00:43:31.110 line:15%
So, 15.
Mmkay.

995
00:43:32.390 --> 00:43:33.223 line:15%
(chair scraping)

996
00:43:33.223 --> 00:43:34.056 line:15%
Oh, whoa, whispers.

997
00:43:34.056 --> 00:43:35.182 line:15%
(Laura speaking with mouth full)

998
00:43:35.182 --> 00:43:37.560 line:15%
Oh boy, we're getting a lot of war tonight.

999
00:43:40.298 --> 00:43:41.860 line:15%
Guys, D&amp;D,

1000
00:43:41.860 --> 00:43:44.320 line:15%
D&amp;D Beyond.
D&amp;D.

1001
00:43:44.320 --> 00:43:48.240 line:15%
How cool is it that Matt has a book coming out with

1002
00:43:48.240 --> 00:43:50.080 line:15%
all this shit in it?
So cool.

1003
00:43:50.080 --> 00:43:53.000 line:15%
He thinks of this shit and then you get to read this shit.

1004
00:43:53.000 --> 00:43:55.950 line:15%
Our canon is canon.
Yeah.

1005
00:43:57.050 --> 00:43:57.883 line:15%
(chair scraping)

1006
00:43:57.883 --> 00:43:59.750 line:15%
Yeah.
Candidates.

1007
00:43:59.750 --> 00:44:01.600 line:15%
Yeah, this, all that shouldn't?

1008
00:44:01.600 --> 00:44:02.770 line:15%
Okay.

1009
00:44:02.770 --> 00:44:04.120 line:15%
What do you mean someone came back

1010
00:44:04.120 --> 00:44:07.050 line:15%
and then they returned to dust?

1011
00:44:08.030 --> 00:44:11.964 line:15%
That they came back and then just poof?

1012
00:44:11.964 --> 00:44:16.620 line:15%
This was an assisted ritual and when they returned,

1013
00:44:16.620 --> 00:44:17.760 line:15%
they turned to dust.
Poof.

1014
00:44:17.760 --> 00:44:19.759 line:15%
I don't know how else to describe it.

1015
00:44:19.759 --> 00:44:20.920 line:15%
How long were they gone?

1016
00:44:20.920 --> 00:44:22.840 line:15%
Oh, it was but a few moments.

1017
00:44:22.840 --> 00:44:24.840 line:15%
Really?
How long ago was this?

1018
00:44:26.860 --> 00:44:28.420 line:15%
70 years.
Whoa.

1019
00:44:28.420 --> 00:44:31.050 line:15%
How long, were you able to talk to them

1020
00:44:31.050 --> 00:44:32.640 line:15%
when they arrived--
Oh, I wasn't

1021
00:44:32.640 --> 00:44:34.990 line:15%
present for this, but I heard about it.

1022
00:44:34.990 --> 00:44:35.823 line:15%
Hmm.
Poof.

1023
00:44:35.823 --> 00:44:38.490 line:15%
And you've heard of two instances?

1024
00:44:38.490 --> 00:44:39.323 line:15%
Mm-hmm.

1025
00:44:39.323 --> 00:44:41.610 line:15%
But you do not know the result of the other.

1026
00:44:42.580 --> 00:44:43.850 line:15%
No.
Well,

1027
00:44:43.850 --> 00:44:45.620 line:15%
just because we don't know the end of the story

1028
00:44:45.620 --> 00:44:47.120 line:15%
does not mean it didn't go on.

1029
00:44:48.840 --> 00:44:50.120 line:15%
This is true.

1030
00:44:50.120 --> 00:44:53.233 line:15%
We met a guy who kind of could control time.

1031
00:44:53.233 --> 00:44:54.820 line:15%
I was just thinking about that.

1032
00:44:54.820 --> 00:44:57.210 line:15%
Oh yeah, we played in his festival fun house.

1033
00:44:57.210 --> 00:44:59.020 line:15%
Yeah, his Happy Fun Ball.
Yes, Happy Fun Ball.

1034
00:44:59.020 --> 00:45:01.680 line:15%
But even if that person was gone for just a moment,

1035
00:45:01.680 --> 00:45:03.100 line:15%
that doesn't mean that they weren't

1036
00:45:03.100 --> 00:45:06.030 line:15%
gone for a very long time.

1037
00:45:06.030 --> 00:45:08.190 line:15%
True.
What was his name again?

1038
00:45:09.310 --> 00:45:10.630 line:15%
Halas.
Halas, yeah.

1039
00:45:11.607 --> 00:45:12.840 line:15%
Have you ever heard of him?

1040
00:45:12.840 --> 00:45:14.640 line:15%
I have.
You have?

1041
00:45:14.640 --> 00:45:16.290 line:15%
Was he the other guy, was he the other story?

1042
00:45:16.290 --> 00:45:17.720 line:15%
Did you know he eats people or something?

1043
00:45:17.720 --> 00:45:18.900 line:15%
He is so, like, really weird.

1044
00:45:18.900 --> 00:45:22.130 line:15%
No, I just know of scattered records

1045
00:45:22.130 --> 00:45:26.210 line:15%
from the previous age.
He dropped a demon.

1046
00:45:26.210 --> 00:45:28.480 line:15%
It's still trapped in his Happy Fun Ball.

1047
00:45:28.480 --> 00:45:30.557 line:15%
What is this Happy Fun Ball?

1048
00:45:30.557 --> 00:45:31.701 line:15%
(laughter)

1049
00:45:31.701 --> 00:45:34.350 line:15%
It's a dimension that he made or at least used

1050
00:45:34.350 --> 00:45:38.870 line:15%
to create a space where he could experiment, draw--

1051
00:45:38.870 --> 00:45:40.849 line:15%
How did you access this?

1052
00:45:40.849 --> 00:45:41.682 line:15%
It's a weird little puzzle

1053
00:45:41.682 --> 00:45:43.460 line:15%
and you shift it around just right.

1054
00:45:43.460 --> 00:45:45.390 line:15%
Yeah, it's two turns left and two turns right--

1055
00:45:45.390 --> 00:45:46.960 line:15%
And then all the sudden, you get sucked in

1056
00:45:46.960 --> 00:45:49.900 line:15%
and you can't get out unless--
You have this right now?

1057
00:45:49.900 --> 00:45:50.860 line:15%
No.
I mean, come on.

1058
00:45:50.860 --> 00:45:54.260 line:15%
We sort of lucked into it, actually.

1059
00:45:54.260 --> 00:45:56.913 line:15%
We are not in possession of it anymore.

1060
00:45:56.913 --> 00:45:59.476 line:15%
There's called the, also the Archmage's--

1061
00:45:59.476 --> 00:46:00.548 line:15%
[Trevor, Laura, &amp; Marisha] Bane.

1062
00:46:00.548 --> 00:46:03.760 line:15%
It was attracted to terminate magic practitioners

1063
00:46:03.760 --> 00:46:05.780 line:15%
that wandered in.
It had a few names.

1064
00:46:05.780 --> 00:46:07.290 line:15%
Nah, I don't feel like, I'm not going to look at my notes.

1065
00:46:07.290 --> 00:46:08.760 line:15%
Have you heard of that?
Pretty violent.

1066
00:46:08.760 --> 00:46:09.620 line:15%
I have not.

1067
00:46:09.620 --> 00:46:12.190 line:15%
Is Halas the other story that you knew?

1068
00:46:12.190 --> 00:46:13.480 line:15%
No, no.

1069
00:46:13.480 --> 00:46:17.160 line:15%
This was all dunamantic-based, within the Dynasty.

1070
00:46:17.160 --> 00:46:18.110 line:15%
But the thing that happened--

1071
00:46:18.110 --> 00:46:19.800 line:15%
Didn't know if his was too, maybe.

1072
00:46:19.800 --> 00:46:22.680 line:15%
Was time moved at a different speed

1073
00:46:22.680 --> 00:46:25.050 line:15%
on the inside than on the outside

1074
00:46:25.050 --> 00:46:27.280 line:15%
and apparently it could change, if I recall.

1075
00:46:27.280 --> 00:46:28.570 line:15%
You couldn't really control it.

1076
00:46:28.570 --> 00:46:31.800 line:15%
You could be in there for 80 years or 8 minutes.

1077
00:46:31.800 --> 00:46:33.860 line:15%
It was more changing the rate of passage.

1078
00:46:33.860 --> 00:46:36.570 line:15%
Mm, that Dunamis-adjacent, though I do not know

1079
00:46:36.570 --> 00:46:39.790 line:15%
if that is specifically, or perhaps an,

1080
00:46:43.400 --> 00:46:46.120 line:15%
a lack of a realization of what he was dabbling with.

1081
00:46:46.120 --> 00:46:47.590 line:15%
Hey Essek?
Yes?

1082
00:46:48.510 --> 00:46:49.970 line:15%
How come all the sudden,

1083
00:46:49.970 --> 00:46:52.590 line:15%
you want to talk to us like we're friends?

1084
00:46:52.590 --> 00:46:54.960 line:15%
Not that I mind because I'm really happy that you're here,

1085
00:46:54.960 --> 00:46:56.490 line:15%
but did we do something cool or something

1086
00:46:56.490 --> 00:46:58.842 line:15%
that you like us all the sudden?

1087
00:46:58.842 --> 00:47:01.232 line:15%
(chuckling)

1088
00:47:01.232 --> 00:47:03.844 line:15%
And he takes his wine, takes a big sip.

1089
00:47:03.844 --> 00:47:04.800 line:15%
Throw me a tea cracker, cookie thing.

1090
00:47:04.800 --> 00:47:06.677 line:15%
Oh god, they're so good.

1091
00:47:06.677 --> 00:47:07.735 line:15%
Just Frisbee that bitch.

1092
00:47:07.735 --> 00:47:08.568 line:15%
(throat clearing)

1093
00:47:08.568 --> 00:47:11.110 line:15%
Would you like a Frisbee cookie?

1094
00:47:11.110 --> 00:47:12.170 line:15%
I'm all right, thank you.

1095
00:47:12.170 --> 00:47:15.380 line:15%
I'll Frisbee that cookie.
Do you want to toss one?

1096
00:47:15.380 --> 00:47:16.240 line:15%
'Kay.

1097
00:47:17.400 --> 00:47:18.909 line:15%
Toss my cookies.

1098
00:47:18.909 --> 00:47:21.326 line:15%
(snickering)

1099
00:47:22.830 --> 00:47:26.640 line:15%
The Dynasty, I've lived here my entire life,

1100
00:47:28.250 --> 00:47:31.590 line:15%
and while there are benefits and there are other places

1101
00:47:31.590 --> 00:47:33.330 line:15%
that are much more challenging to live in,

1102
00:47:33.330 --> 00:47:36.380 line:15%
I find it frustrating at times.

1103
00:47:38.090 --> 00:47:43.090 line:15%
I find that the obsession with this Luxon entity

1104
00:47:43.150 --> 00:47:48.150 line:15%
belies what the truth may be, that these artifacts,

1105
00:47:48.230 --> 00:47:53.230 line:15%
I theorize, have nothing to do with a divine being

1106
00:47:53.420 --> 00:47:56.320 line:15%
but are just perhaps artifacts designed

1107
00:47:56.320 --> 00:47:58.570 line:15%
in the Age of Arcanum that have been misread.

1108
00:47:59.910 --> 00:48:02.620 line:15%
In which case, it is being misused

1109
00:48:03.530 --> 00:48:05.060 line:15%
or at least only the surface

1110
00:48:05.060 --> 00:48:06.960 line:15%
has been scratched of what's possible.

1111
00:48:08.850 --> 00:48:09.683 line:15%
So,

1112
00:48:10.630 --> 00:48:11.660 line:15%
my interests

1113
00:48:13.310 --> 00:48:16.800 line:15%
leave me not trusting anyone,

1114
00:48:16.800 --> 00:48:18.850 line:15%
not feeling like I, in some ways, belong.

1115
00:48:20.880 --> 00:48:23.800 line:15%
And as such, I spend a lot of my time in solitude.

1116
00:48:23.800 --> 00:48:25.610 line:15%
Why trust us with your interests?

1117
00:48:27.701 --> 00:48:29.090 line:15%
(inhaling)

1118
00:48:29.090 --> 00:48:30.860 line:15%
Because I'm thankful to have met you.

1119
00:48:33.630 --> 00:48:35.460 line:15%
I don't have much in the way of friends,

1120
00:48:37.390 --> 00:48:42.390 line:15%
due to the expectations placed upon me and you are driven,

1121
00:48:43.850 --> 00:48:46.580 line:15%
you are adaptable, you're clever,

1122
00:48:48.494 --> 00:48:49.780 line:15%
and not shackled by blind devotion

1123
00:48:49.780 --> 00:48:52.080 line:15%
to one flawed society or another.

1124
00:48:55.577 --> 00:48:56.410 line:15%
I think you all have what it takes

1125
00:48:56.410 --> 00:48:58.310 line:15%
to survive in this cold, cruel world,

1126
00:49:00.220 --> 00:49:02.020 line:15%
as it's something I pride myself on.

1127
00:49:03.730 --> 00:49:04.998 line:15%
And,

1128
00:49:04.998 --> 00:49:07.581 line:15%
(gentle music)

1129
00:49:10.169 --> 00:49:12.550 line:15%
I don't know, I haven't felt a kinship with

1130
00:49:14.330 --> 00:49:16.540 line:15%
anyone in a long time.

1131
00:49:18.790 --> 00:49:20.740 line:15%
Is this friendship safe for you here?

1132
00:49:23.200 --> 00:49:26.080 line:15%
Nothing I do is safe.
Fuck.

1133
00:49:27.110 --> 00:49:27.960 line:15%
Fuck, I like him.

1134
00:49:29.725 --> 00:49:30.990 line:15%
You can go get in the hot tub.

1135
00:49:31.829 --> 00:49:32.662 line:15%
Uh.

1136
00:49:35.070 --> 00:49:37.200 line:15%
And he goes and takes some of the food off the plate and,

1137
00:49:37.200 --> 00:49:39.980 line:15%
"This is very good, Caduceus."

1138
00:49:41.296 --> 00:49:43.590 line:15%
We appreciate the trust, it means a lot.

1139
00:49:43.590 --> 00:49:44.430 line:15%
We move around

1140
00:49:46.090 --> 00:49:47.240 line:15%
quite a bit ourselves.

1141
00:49:47.240 --> 00:49:50.520 line:15%
You've been a rock for us and that's appreciated.

1142
00:49:50.520 --> 00:49:52.168 line:15%
Should I tell him secrets?

1143
00:49:52.168 --> 00:49:53.001 line:15%
I feel like I should

1144
00:49:53.001 --> 00:49:53.834 line:15%
tell him secrets.
Right now, right--

1145
00:49:53.834 --> 00:49:55.600 line:15%
We owe him some favors.
Yeah.

1146
00:49:55.600 --> 00:49:58.050 line:15%
Hey, what, yeah, let's do that first.

1147
00:49:58.050 --> 00:49:59.580 line:15%
What do you mean by that?

1148
00:49:59.580 --> 00:50:00.817 line:15%
What favors?

1149
00:50:00.817 --> 00:50:01.820 line:15%
(crunching)

1150
00:50:01.820 --> 00:50:03.140 line:15%
I don't know.

1151
00:50:03.140 --> 00:50:04.550 line:15%
Perhaps some of my research at some time

1152
00:50:04.550 --> 00:50:08.590 line:15%
might require more hands than those I have at myself.

1153
00:50:09.480 --> 00:50:10.920 line:15%
How many do you have?

1154
00:50:10.920 --> 00:50:11.753 line:15%
Two.
Oh.

1155
00:50:14.400 --> 00:50:15.233 line:15%
We can get hands.

1156
00:50:15.233 --> 00:50:16.840 line:15%
We kill a lotta people on occasion.

1157
00:50:16.840 --> 00:50:19.241 line:15%
Yeah, or we can use our own hands.

1158
00:50:19.241 --> 00:50:20.190 line:15%
(paper rustling)

1159
00:50:20.190 --> 00:50:22.290 line:15%
Oh, oh yeah, okay.
Yeah.

1160
00:50:22.290 --> 00:50:23.620 line:15%
Still.

1161
00:50:23.620 --> 00:50:24.900 line:15%
While we're asking questions,

1162
00:50:24.900 --> 00:50:26.340 line:15%
you've asked a few questions of me,

1163
00:50:26.340 --> 00:50:28.130 line:15%
I'll ask a few questions, and you can ask some more.

1164
00:50:28.130 --> 00:50:29.500 line:15%
This is how conversation works, right?

1165
00:50:29.500 --> 00:50:31.509 line:15%
Yeah.
I'm a little rusty.

1166
00:50:31.509 --> 00:50:32.410 line:15%
Oh, wow.
Um.

1167
00:50:33.580 --> 00:50:35.030 line:15%
It's all right.
Do you--

1168
00:50:36.858 --> 00:50:38.471 line:15%
Yeah, I can relate.

1169
00:50:38.471 --> 00:50:40.860 line:15%
Do you ever get lonely in your solitude?

1170
00:50:43.000 --> 00:50:44.910 line:15%
I didn't think so until recently.

1171
00:50:46.631 --> 00:50:47.756 line:15%
Hm.

1172
00:50:47.756 --> 00:50:49.670 line:15%
(gentle music)

1173
00:50:49.670 --> 00:50:50.520 line:15%
What about you?

1174
00:50:52.540 --> 00:50:53.373 line:15%
Um,

1175
00:50:56.910 --> 00:50:57.743 line:15%
yes.

1176
00:50:58.970 --> 00:51:02.310 line:15%
I think, if I'm answering honestly,

1177
00:51:03.940 --> 00:51:05.270 line:15%
I think,

1178
00:51:05.270 --> 00:51:06.103 line:15%
but I think

1179
00:51:07.800 --> 00:51:08.830 line:15%
I almost became

1180
00:51:10.070 --> 00:51:12.480 line:15%
more lonely in my solitude

1181
00:51:12.480 --> 00:51:15.360 line:15%
after I became friends with all of them

1182
00:51:16.630 --> 00:51:18.574 line:15%
because I realized

1183
00:51:18.574 --> 00:51:21.390 line:15%
(gentle music)

1184
00:51:21.390 --> 00:51:23.190 line:15%
what having good friends feels like.

1185
00:51:24.627 --> 00:51:25.460 line:15%
Hm.

1186
00:51:26.714 --> 00:51:29.810 line:15%
(gentle music)

1187
00:51:29.810 --> 00:51:32.334 line:15%
Oh, you're going to be so sad if we leave

1188
00:51:32.334 --> 00:51:34.766 line:15%
because you like us so much now.

1189
00:51:34.766 --> 00:51:36.640 line:15%
(wheezing laughter)

1190
00:51:36.640 --> 00:51:39.040 line:15%
I'm drawing Essek.
What,

1191
00:51:40.365 --> 00:51:42.520 line:15%
(throat clearing)

1192
00:51:42.520 --> 00:51:45.070 line:15%
what is it that you with to accomplish, Beauregard?

1193
00:51:47.490 --> 00:51:48.690 line:15%
I'm doing pretty good.

1194
00:51:52.162 --> 00:51:54.830 line:15%
I'm Main Expositor now.
Congratulations.

1195
00:51:54.830 --> 00:51:56.350 line:15%
Thank you.

1196
00:51:56.350 --> 00:52:00.910 line:15%
So, considering (takes deep breath) I wasn't sure

1197
00:52:00.910 --> 00:52:03.220 line:15%
if I was going to live past 19

1198
00:52:03.220 --> 00:52:06.390 line:15%
or make it outta my hometown or amount to any

1199
00:52:07.910 --> 00:52:11.450 line:15%
remote decent person in society,

1200
00:52:11.450 --> 00:52:13.640 line:15%
I'm not really, I don't know if I'd say I'm a decent,

1201
00:52:13.640 --> 00:52:16.615 line:15%
I didn't know if I was going to amount to anything, so.

1202
00:52:16.615 --> 00:52:17.860 line:15%
I'm feeling pretty fucking great.

1203
00:52:19.557 --> 00:52:22.540 line:15%
It feels nice sometimes to be the youngest while people

1204
00:52:22.540 --> 00:52:25.080 line:15%
expect little of you and then to prove them wrong.

1205
00:52:26.590 --> 00:52:28.140 line:15%
Yeah, the bar was pretty low.

1206
00:52:29.390 --> 00:52:31.040 line:15%
Just hope you can maintain that

1207
00:52:32.270 --> 00:52:36.570 line:15%
bar you raise to your own standards, not theirs.

1208
00:52:36.570 --> 00:52:38.080 line:15%
(sniffing)

1209
00:52:38.080 --> 00:52:40.020 line:15%
Yeah well, you always hold yourself

1210
00:52:40.020 --> 00:52:41.490 line:15%
to the highest of standards first,

1211
00:52:41.490 --> 00:52:42.920 line:15%
right?
Hm, true.

1212
00:52:44.713 --> 00:52:45.546 line:15%
What about you, Fjord?

1213
00:52:48.620 --> 00:52:50.690 line:15%
What do I want?
What do you want?

1214
00:52:50.690 --> 00:52:51.980 line:15%
He's very religious.

1215
00:52:53.150 --> 00:52:56.080 line:15%
No, I, I'm practicing faith.

1216
00:52:59.202 --> 00:53:01.535 line:15%
(chuckling)

1217
00:53:04.786 --> 00:53:06.619 line:15%
I'm not actually sure.

1218
00:53:08.910 --> 00:53:11.340 line:15%
Whatever it was that I started out

1219
00:53:11.340 --> 00:53:13.030 line:15%
thinking was important to me seems,

1220
00:53:13.030 --> 00:53:15.420 line:15%
with time, to have faded into something else.

1221
00:53:19.120 --> 00:53:23.530 line:15%
I've been pulled into adventures and conflicts

1222
00:53:23.530 --> 00:53:25.530 line:15%
with this wonderful group of people and

1223
00:53:26.920 --> 00:53:30.290 line:15%
I want to see them protected and kept.

1224
00:53:33.610 --> 00:53:34.460 line:15%
It seems my

1225
00:53:36.520 --> 00:53:40.820 line:15%
personal matters from before just have sort of

1226
00:53:40.820 --> 00:53:43.390 line:15%
taken a back seat to sort of the

1227
00:53:43.390 --> 00:53:47.620 line:15%
grander things on our stage these days.

1228
00:53:47.620 --> 00:53:48.453 line:15%
Hm.

1229
00:53:53.790 --> 00:53:54.623 line:15%
And you, Jester.

1230
00:53:56.620 --> 00:53:58.240 line:15%
What is it you are seeking?

1231
00:53:58.240 --> 00:53:59.750 line:15%
What am I seeking?
Mm-hmm.

1232
00:54:02.340 --> 00:54:07.020 line:15%
Well, there's Traveler Con coming up, so I'm seeking--

1233
00:54:07.986 --> 00:54:08.819 line:15%
I'm not familiar with that.
He doesn't

1234
00:54:08.819 --> 00:54:11.610 line:15%
know what that is.
Well--

1235
00:54:11.610 --> 00:54:13.910 line:15%
She's seeking a hotel room and--

1236
00:54:13.910 --> 00:54:15.920 line:15%
Here's the, I mean, yeah, we have to find,

1237
00:54:15.920 --> 00:54:18.340 line:15%
there's so many preparations we have to make.

1238
00:54:18.340 --> 00:54:19.960 line:15%
If you make the elevator pitch.

1239
00:54:19.960 --> 00:54:22.120 line:15%
Okay.
Kind of.

1240
00:54:22.120 --> 00:54:23.920 line:15%
Have you heard of the Traveler?

1241
00:54:25.236 --> 00:54:27.110 line:15%
Oh no.
I have heard of it

1242
00:54:27.110 --> 00:54:30.110 line:15%
in the context of your arrival.

1243
00:54:30.110 --> 00:54:33.393 line:15%
Oh.
(muffled laughter)

1244
00:54:35.500 --> 00:54:37.940 line:15%
Well, the Traveler is a god

1245
00:54:39.020 --> 00:54:42.800 line:15%
who, obviously, like, normally I wouldn't mention it

1246
00:54:42.800 --> 00:54:45.990 line:15%
around people here because I don't want to get murdered

1247
00:54:45.990 --> 00:54:47.990 line:15%
because of, you know, but that's okay

1248
00:54:47.990 --> 00:54:51.160 line:15%
because sometimes, you know, if you're super into your god,

1249
00:54:51.160 --> 00:54:54.740 line:15%
you're supposed to maybe get killed for them, I don't know.

1250
00:54:54.740 --> 00:54:55.980 line:15%
I don't think the Traveler would want me

1251
00:54:55.980 --> 00:54:58.380 line:15%
to be killed for him, though, right now.

1252
00:54:58.380 --> 00:54:59.580 line:15%
That is not--
Anyway,

1253
00:54:59.580 --> 00:55:02.480 line:15%
the Traveler's really cool, he wears this green cloak,

1254
00:55:02.480 --> 00:55:07.220 line:15%
he's super powerful, he travels around, he's always with us.

1255
00:55:07.220 --> 00:55:10.220 line:15%
He likes, you know, for you to do good things

1256
00:55:10.220 --> 00:55:13.020 line:15%
and bad things, he likes for there to be a good balance.

1257
00:55:14.483 --> 00:55:17.940 line:15%
If you feel like doing something funny, he's into it.

1258
00:55:17.940 --> 00:55:19.590 line:15%
Bad things?
What?

1259
00:55:19.590 --> 00:55:22.720 line:15%
Well, like, little bad things, not like bad things.

1260
00:55:22.720 --> 00:55:24.530 line:15%
No, not like bad things, bad things,

1261
00:55:24.530 --> 00:55:25.363 line:15%
but it's like--
Tricky things.

1262
00:55:25.363 --> 00:55:28.280 line:15%
Like naughty things?
Well yeah, but like,

1263
00:55:28.280 --> 00:55:31.390 line:15%
that's, you know, everybody shows their

1264
00:55:31.390 --> 00:55:33.320 line:15%
devotion to the Traveler differently.

1265
00:55:33.320 --> 00:55:36.040 line:15%
I'm sure maybe there's murderers out there or something

1266
00:55:36.040 --> 00:55:38.700 line:15%
that can be, you know, liking the Traveler

1267
00:55:38.700 --> 00:55:40.860 line:15%
but at the same time, if they murder people,

1268
00:55:40.860 --> 00:55:43.130 line:15%
then maybe they have to go and make a lot of babies.

1269
00:55:43.130 --> 00:55:45.770 line:15%
I don't know, you know, it's all about balance.

1270
00:55:45.770 --> 00:55:46.910 line:15%
That seems--
Maybe

1271
00:55:46.910 --> 00:55:48.210 line:15%
I'm presenting this wrong.

1272
00:55:49.400 --> 00:55:52.320 line:15%
What I'm saying is we're having a big convention

1273
00:55:52.320 --> 00:55:54.150 line:15%
for everybody that's super into him

1274
00:55:54.150 --> 00:55:56.650 line:15%
and we're going to get together and that's happening

1275
00:55:56.650 --> 00:55:58.270 line:15%
in a month.
Interesting.

1276
00:55:58.270 --> 00:55:59.700 line:15%
They're sounding more like a cult.

1277
00:55:59.700 --> 00:56:01.640 line:15%
It's never sounded like a cult.

1278
00:56:01.640 --> 00:56:03.170 line:15%
It's a cult.
It's not a cult,

1279
00:56:03.170 --> 00:56:04.650 line:15%
it's not a cult, it's not a cult.

1280
00:56:04.650 --> 00:56:07.190 line:15%
There's like, because the thing is, here's the thing.

1281
00:56:07.190 --> 00:56:09.630 line:15%
If it's a cult, then it's not,

1282
00:56:09.630 --> 00:56:11.810 line:15%
you're not actually worshiping like a god or something,

1283
00:56:11.810 --> 00:56:13.130 line:15%
you know, you're just worshiping a person

1284
00:56:13.130 --> 00:56:14.730 line:15%
that thinks they're, like, religions

1285
00:56:14.730 --> 00:56:17.430 line:15%
or a god or something, but this guy really is a god.

1286
00:56:19.410 --> 00:56:23.203 line:15%
So it's a religion.
You have a point.

1287
00:56:24.590 --> 00:56:26.295 line:15%
Well, good luck.

1288
00:56:26.295 --> 00:56:27.440 line:15%
(laughter)

1289
00:56:27.440 --> 00:56:29.560 line:15%
Do you want to hear more about him?

1290
00:56:29.560 --> 00:56:30.820 line:15%
I'm fine.
I can,

1291
00:56:32.911 --> 00:56:35.540 line:15%
I have, here, I'm going to get my brochure out.

1292
00:56:35.540 --> 00:56:37.040 line:15%
Here, take it.

1293
00:56:37.040 --> 00:56:39.110 line:15%
If you just want to read up sometime

1294
00:56:39.110 --> 00:56:41.330 line:15%
or if you just, like, want to meditate with me

1295
00:56:41.330 --> 00:56:44.250 line:15%
and talk, you know, then maybe we can discuss.

1296
00:56:44.250 --> 00:56:45.540 line:15%
If you want to come to Traveler Con--

1297
00:56:45.540 --> 00:56:46.560 line:15%
Some good pictures in here.

1298
00:56:46.560 --> 00:56:47.620 line:15%
Do you want to tell him

1299
00:56:47.620 --> 00:56:50.040 line:15%
what happens at Traveler Con, perhaps?

1300
00:56:50.040 --> 00:56:51.290 line:15%
We're going and it's going to be

1301
00:56:51.290 --> 00:56:53.310 line:15%
at the volcano and it's going to be super fun.

1302
00:56:53.310 --> 00:56:54.960 line:15%
We'll probably have some big speakers,

1303
00:56:54.960 --> 00:56:57.980 line:15%
maybe a band play, I'm not sure.

1304
00:56:57.980 --> 00:56:59.860 line:15%
We'll probably have some, like, a party,

1305
00:56:59.860 --> 00:57:03.080 line:15%
a dance party, maybe, like, you know?

1306
00:57:03.080 --> 00:57:05.120 line:15%
Maybe a costume contest, I'm not sure.

1307
00:57:05.120 --> 00:57:07.000 line:15%
Do you want to come to a volcano?

1308
00:57:07.000 --> 00:57:08.540 line:15%
Do you want to go to a volcano?

1309
00:57:08.540 --> 00:57:10.437 line:15%
I'm all right.
We have a ship.

1310
00:57:10.437 --> 00:57:11.270 line:15%
(chuckling)

1311
00:57:11.270 --> 00:57:12.103 line:15%
Jessie?
Hm?

1312
00:57:12.103 --> 00:57:14.740 line:15%
Traveler Con I'm a hundred percent down with

1313
00:57:14.740 --> 00:57:18.730 line:15%
and I think it's great, but going to Traveler Con is not

1314
00:57:20.000 --> 00:57:22.100 line:15%
what you seek, is it?

1315
00:57:22.100 --> 00:57:22.933 line:15%
Well,

1316
00:57:24.140 --> 00:57:25.140 line:15%
no

1317
00:57:25.140 --> 00:57:26.560 line:15%
but

1318
00:57:26.560 --> 00:57:30.120 line:15%
well, I mean, ultimately,

1319
00:57:30.120 --> 00:57:31.750 line:15%
you know,

1320
00:57:31.750 --> 00:57:34.820 line:15%
I'm just trying to find,

1321
00:57:35.960 --> 00:57:39.240 line:15%
you know, like, where I fit in in the world,

1322
00:57:41.690 --> 00:57:44.050 line:15%
ultimately.
That is a very,

1323
00:57:45.450 --> 00:57:47.750 line:15%
a very noble mortal cause.

1324
00:57:50.100 --> 00:57:53.070 line:15%
Also, how many babies makes up for a murder?

1325
00:57:53.950 --> 00:57:54.960 line:15%
You know, maybe one.

1326
00:57:54.960 --> 00:57:56.860 line:15%
You take one, you give one, I'm not sure.

1327
00:57:56.860 --> 00:57:59.100 line:15%
Okay, it's give a penny, take a penny, got it.

1328
00:57:59.100 --> 00:57:59.970 line:15%
I'm not sure, you know?

1329
00:57:59.970 --> 00:58:02.140 line:15%
I haven't actually talked to the Traveler about that

1330
00:58:02.140 --> 00:58:04.990 line:15%
because I don't, you know, murder people on a regular basis,

1331
00:58:04.990 --> 00:58:07.260 line:15%
but he did give me healing powers because,

1332
00:58:07.260 --> 00:58:08.590 line:15%
you know, maybe because we're out

1333
00:58:08.590 --> 00:58:10.020 line:15%
doing these kind of things, you know?

1334
00:58:10.020 --> 00:58:12.540 line:15%
We fight people so maybe that's why I can heal people.

1335
00:58:12.540 --> 00:58:15.200 line:15%
What is the worst thing you've ever done?

1336
00:58:15.200 --> 00:58:16.570 line:15%
As far as bad things go.

1337
00:58:18.276 --> 00:58:21.710 line:15%
Oh, well I stuck an ax in a dude's head one time.

1338
00:58:21.710 --> 00:58:23.450 line:15%
Yeah, I watched you do it.

1339
00:58:23.450 --> 00:58:25.150 line:15%
Yeah, that one was pretty fucked up.

1340
00:58:25.150 --> 00:58:28.450 line:15%
But that was bad ass and totally justified.

1341
00:58:28.450 --> 00:58:31.010 line:15%
I mean, he was going to potentially kill us.

1342
00:58:31.010 --> 00:58:32.590 line:15%
Yeah.
Too, so.

1343
00:58:32.590 --> 00:58:34.952 line:15%
I was just defending.
More talk tarts.

1344
00:58:34.952 --> 00:58:36.610 line:15%
More talk tarts.

1345
00:58:37.903 --> 00:58:38.736 line:15%
What about you, Essek?

1346
00:58:38.736 --> 00:58:40.719 line:15%
What's the worst thing you've ever done?

1347
00:58:40.719 --> 00:58:45.719 line:15%
(chuckles) (sighs) I would say

1348
00:58:46.503 --> 00:58:49.086 line:15%
(gentle music)

1349
00:58:53.510 --> 00:58:55.390 line:15%
angered my father to a point where he

1350
00:58:58.220 --> 00:59:00.580 line:15%
went unprepared into the depths of

1351
00:59:00.580 --> 00:59:01.930 line:15%
Bazzoxan and didn't return.

1352
00:59:04.650 --> 00:59:07.090 line:15%
Oh, I'm sorry.
All right, that's--

1353
00:59:07.090 --> 00:59:08.450 line:15%
What'd you do to make him so mad?

1354
00:59:08.450 --> 00:59:10.040 line:15%
That's a lot to unpack.

1355
00:59:10.040 --> 00:59:12.490 line:15%
And why do you think you're responsible for that?

1356
00:59:13.410 --> 00:59:16.430 line:15%
Like, even before you tell us what you did,

1357
00:59:16.430 --> 00:59:17.700 line:15%
why do you think you're responsible for

1358
00:59:17.700 --> 00:59:20.960 line:15%
your dad not returning?
It's complicated.

1359
00:59:22.360 --> 00:59:23.870 line:15%
When I say bad in the sense of what is

1360
00:59:23.870 --> 00:59:27.540 line:15%
largely assumed to be considered a bad thing.

1361
00:59:28.824 --> 00:59:30.180 line:15%
It doesn't bother me necessarily.

1362
00:59:30.180 --> 00:59:32.110 line:15%
He wasn't a great man.

1363
00:59:34.489 --> 00:59:37.040 line:15%
He had little aspirations.

1364
00:59:39.266 --> 00:59:41.950 line:15%
Do you mind if I ask if it was

1365
00:59:41.950 --> 00:59:44.600 line:15%
Bazzoxan near a Beacon?

1366
00:59:46.820 --> 00:59:50.140 line:15%
Yes, and there is an opportunity that he will return.

1367
00:59:52.990 --> 00:59:54.560 line:15%
Just wanted to check.

1368
00:59:57.060 --> 00:59:59.600 line:15%
That's got to be odd, raising your parents.

1369
01:00:01.145 --> 01:00:02.120 line:15%
(chuckling)

1370
01:00:02.120 --> 01:00:03.120 line:15%
Oh, weird.
Yeah,

1371
01:00:03.120 --> 01:00:04.900 line:15%
the more you think about it.

1372
01:00:04.900 --> 01:00:05.733 line:15%
Doesn't everyone--

1373
01:00:05.733 --> 01:00:06.730 line:15%
Did you say raising your parents?

1374
01:00:06.730 --> 01:00:09.000 line:15%
Well if he comes back as a kid.

1375
01:00:09.000 --> 01:00:12.980 line:15%
And you know he's your dad but he's also five.

1376
01:00:12.980 --> 01:00:14.780 line:15%
Nope, not going there.

1377
01:00:14.780 --> 01:00:16.660 line:15%
It has to have happened.

1378
01:00:16.660 --> 01:00:18.520 line:15%
Oh, numerous times.

1379
01:00:19.570 --> 01:00:21.310 line:15%
Not to me yet and I'm

1380
01:00:24.410 --> 01:00:26.250 line:15%
curious to see what that would

1381
01:00:26.250 --> 01:00:29.420 line:15%
be like when or if he returns.

1382
01:00:32.380 --> 01:00:35.880 line:15%
When somebody dies and they're in love

1383
01:00:35.880 --> 01:00:38.420 line:15%
with somebody else and then that person gets

1384
01:00:38.420 --> 01:00:42.140 line:15%
really old and it's like a 200 year old person, right?

1385
01:00:42.140 --> 01:00:44.170 line:15%
And then the other person realizes when they were, like,

1386
01:00:44.170 --> 01:00:46.970 line:15%
15 that, that like, "Oh my God, I loved this person."

1387
01:00:46.970 --> 01:00:51.660 line:15%
Do they marry the person when they're adolescent

1388
01:00:51.660 --> 01:00:56.200 line:15%
or does it not transfer that sort of emotional feeling?

1389
01:00:59.260 --> 01:01:00.370 line:15%
Like, when you're star-crossed lovers

1390
01:01:00.370 --> 01:01:02.250 line:15%
for all time or do you, like--

1391
01:01:02.250 --> 01:01:03.620 line:15%
Reset.
Yeah.

1392
01:01:03.620 --> 01:01:06.480 line:15%
It, (sputters) these are not matters

1393
01:01:06.480 --> 01:01:09.590 line:15%
I've conjectured too often, but there are individuals

1394
01:01:09.590 --> 01:01:12.480 line:15%
that have relationships that span multiple lifetimes.

1395
01:01:12.480 --> 01:01:14.400 line:15%
Whoa.
There are those that,

1396
01:01:14.400 --> 01:01:16.360 line:15%
over lifetimes, feelings change,

1397
01:01:16.360 --> 01:01:20.560 line:15%
as the heart itself, for some, does evolve and wander.

1398
01:01:20.560 --> 01:01:24.140 line:15%
For others, it is held straight and narrow.

1399
01:01:24.140 --> 01:01:26.433 line:15%
How long--
The 700 year itch.

1400
01:01:26.433 --> 01:01:28.763 line:15%
(laughter)

1401
01:01:28.763 --> 01:01:31.590 line:15%
I'm still figuring a lot of this out.

1402
01:01:31.590 --> 01:01:33.500 line:15%
I understand, it's a lot to take in. (chuckles)

1403
01:01:33.500 --> 01:01:35.710 line:15%
Yeah, it--
Terrible.

1404
01:01:35.710 --> 01:01:40.710 line:15%
So, can a person still be dead for a very long time

1405
01:01:40.780 --> 01:01:45.780 line:15%
for them to come back into another body, or does it happen

1406
01:01:45.802 --> 01:01:47.040 line:15%
(snaps) instantly?
As far as

1407
01:01:47.040 --> 01:01:49.550 line:15%
I understand it, it's fairly quick.

1408
01:01:51.419 --> 01:01:52.420 line:15%
Oh.
I mean, as long as

1409
01:01:52.420 --> 01:01:56.160 line:15%
it happens in a place where people are being born.

1410
01:01:59.048 --> 01:02:00.050 line:15%
I think, theoretically, if a Luxon

1411
01:02:00.050 --> 01:02:04.910 line:15%
were to be in the presence of, let's say, theoretically,

1412
01:02:04.910 --> 01:02:08.890 line:15%
thousands of deaths and yet, no children are born,

1413
01:02:08.890 --> 01:02:10.240 line:15%
they would just be waiting.

1414
01:02:12.080 --> 01:02:13.910 line:15%
But then with each progressive birth

1415
01:02:13.910 --> 01:02:16.060 line:15%
within the radius of the Luxon,

1416
01:02:16.910 --> 01:02:20.760 line:15%
those souls would then be transferred with each new child.

1417
01:02:20.760 --> 01:02:22.490 line:15%
So, if one of the Beacons got

1418
01:02:22.490 --> 01:02:24.800 line:15%
stolen with a bunch of souls,

1419
01:02:26.590 --> 01:02:28.210 line:15%
or does it--
Yeah.

1420
01:02:29.600 --> 01:02:31.950 line:15%
But, it would just let out

1421
01:02:31.950 --> 01:02:34.400 line:15%
the souls as it traveled, right?

1422
01:02:34.400 --> 01:02:37.380 line:15%
But only to those that have been consecuted.

1423
01:02:37.380 --> 01:02:39.440 line:15%
Well, the souls that've been captured are the ones

1424
01:02:39.440 --> 01:02:40.720 line:15%
that are consecuted.
Oh, right.

1425
01:02:40.720 --> 01:02:43.880 line:15%
If you were to travel with the Beacon, in theory,

1426
01:02:43.880 --> 01:02:45.820 line:15%
then they would disperse as children

1427
01:02:45.820 --> 01:02:47.390 line:15%
were born within that radius.

1428
01:02:47.390 --> 01:02:48.590 line:15%
Whoa.

1429
01:02:49.577 --> 01:02:50.720 line:15%
Like a fog bomb.
Yeah.

1430
01:02:50.720 --> 01:02:51.553 line:15%
Overreaching.

1431
01:02:52.450 --> 01:02:54.030 line:15%
Do the other Beacons

1432
01:02:55.280 --> 01:02:59.510 line:15%
share a pocket universe, are they all connected?

1433
01:02:59.510 --> 01:03:01.840 line:15%
Or are you, you jettison into

1434
01:03:01.840 --> 01:03:03.967 line:15%
a specific Beacon and then that--

1435
01:03:03.967 --> 01:03:05.080 line:15%
Or is that part of your research?

1436
01:03:05.080 --> 01:03:07.110 line:15%
That is part of what I'm curious about,

1437
01:03:07.110 --> 01:03:09.860 line:15%
but such Beacons are heavily guarded

1438
01:03:09.860 --> 01:03:13.280 line:15%
and are assigned to certain individuals,

1439
01:03:14.921 --> 01:03:18.840 line:15%
for the interests of the religion, to keep.

1440
01:03:18.840 --> 01:03:20.710 line:15%
Is there any knowledge of the

1441
01:03:20.710 --> 01:03:23.190 line:15%
in between, any recollection?

1442
01:03:24.060 --> 01:03:25.730 line:15%
None that have been recorded.

1443
01:03:26.950 --> 01:03:28.618 line:15%
Whoa.
Just off in the--

1444
01:03:28.618 --> 01:03:29.480 line:15%
(sniffing)

1445
01:03:29.480 --> 01:03:31.870 line:15%
How often are you able to interact with a Beacon?

1446
01:03:31.870 --> 01:03:36.190 line:15%
Like, you, Beacon, study hall.

1447
01:03:36.190 --> 01:03:37.050 line:15%
Not often.

1448
01:03:38.150 --> 01:03:41.990 line:15%
There is a lot of importance in having them

1449
01:03:41.990 --> 01:03:46.990 line:15%
specifically located and kept safe within approved areas

1450
01:03:47.220 --> 01:03:50.240 line:15%
of Xhorhas to ensure that the masses of the population

1451
01:03:50.240 --> 01:03:53.870 line:15%
are usually within the radius of one.

1452
01:03:53.870 --> 01:03:57.070 line:15%
Have you ever stared at one for about a minute?

1453
01:03:57.070 --> 01:03:59.520 line:15%
If you're referring as to whether or not I have

1454
01:04:01.340 --> 01:04:04.430 line:15%
attuned with it for a moment, numerous times, yes.

1455
01:04:04.430 --> 01:04:05.510 line:15%
Of course.

1456
01:04:05.510 --> 01:04:07.930 line:15%
I'll trade you a secret if it

1457
01:04:07.930 --> 01:04:10.352 line:15%
crosses off one of those favors.

1458
01:04:10.352 --> 01:04:13.102 line:15%
(paper rustling)

1459
01:04:14.880 --> 01:04:16.680 line:15%
It better be one heck of a secret.

1460
01:04:18.380 --> 01:04:20.130 line:15%
Done some research on the Luxons.

1461
01:04:21.850 --> 01:04:24.060 line:15%
Beacons, the Luxons, are those things--

1462
01:04:24.060 --> 01:04:25.630 line:15%
The Luxon Beacons.
The Luxon,

1463
01:04:25.630 --> 01:04:26.540 line:15%
I've done some research on the

1464
01:04:26.540 --> 01:04:28.758 line:15%
Luxon Beaxons.
Beacons.

1465
01:04:28.758 --> 01:04:29.893 line:15%
(laughter)

1466
01:04:29.893 --> 01:04:31.476 line:15%
Luxon Beaxons, Luxon Beaxons.

1467
01:04:31.476 --> 01:04:34.134 line:15%
(laughter)

1468
01:04:34.134 --> 01:04:36.400 line:15%
You sound very knowledgeable about them, so this'll be--

1469
01:04:36.400 --> 01:04:38.650 line:15%
We've had, like, two bottles of wine, okay?

1470
01:04:39.525 --> 01:04:40.391 line:15%
(laughter)

1471
01:04:40.391 --> 01:04:42.500 line:15%
With tossing, tossing maple cookies.

1472
01:04:42.500 --> 01:04:45.513 line:15%
They're really good.
They are very good.

1473
01:04:45.513 --> 01:04:46.412 line:15%
Sweet.

1474
01:04:46.412 --> 01:04:47.610 line:15%
(paper rustling)

1475
01:04:47.610 --> 01:04:49.160 line:15%
The Empire found another one.

1476
01:04:52.684 --> 01:04:54.540 line:15%
(paper rustling)

1477
01:04:54.540 --> 01:04:57.040 line:15%
They uncovered it in the archeological

1478
01:04:57.040 --> 01:05:00.960 line:15%
dig site of Pride's Call, where they found

1479
01:05:03.060 --> 01:05:04.860 line:15%
a lot of arcane weapons

1480
01:05:06.060 --> 01:05:06.893 line:15%
from the

1481
01:05:09.540 --> 01:05:11.310 line:15%
pre-calamity stuff.

1482
01:05:12.147 --> 01:05:13.500 line:15%
(snorting)
(laughter)

1483
01:05:13.500 --> 01:05:15.580 line:15%
Secret secrets.
Checks out.

1484
01:05:16.729 --> 01:05:18.104 line:15%
(paper rustling)

1485
01:05:18.104 --> 01:05:20.950 line:15%
No, that's my notes.
Over 1.5.

1486
01:05:20.950 --> 01:05:22.050 line:15%
Mm-hmm.
Yeah, yeah.

1487
01:05:23.740 --> 01:05:26.090 line:15%
From the Age of Arcanum, right?

1488
01:05:26.090 --> 01:05:28.260 line:15%
That's what I was looking for.

1489
01:05:28.260 --> 01:05:30.430 line:15%
I ask you this: what are your

1490
01:05:30.430 --> 01:05:33.510 line:15%
opinions on war, on this conflict?

1491
01:05:33.510 --> 01:05:36.250 line:15%
What is it good for?
Nothing, that's what.

1492
01:05:36.250 --> 01:05:37.685 line:15%
Huh.
Say it again.

1493
01:05:37.685 --> 01:05:40.685 line:15%
(wheezing laughter)

1494
01:05:41.570 --> 01:05:43.420 line:15%
That was so fast.
It was.

1495
01:05:43.420 --> 01:05:46.530 line:15%
It was traveled.
Wow.

1496
01:05:47.535 --> 01:05:49.088 line:15%
(laughter)

1497
01:05:49.088 --> 01:05:50.701 line:15%
I mean, that, basically, that's our stance, right?

1498
01:05:50.701 --> 01:05:51.534 line:15%
(laughs) Yeah.

1499
01:05:51.534 --> 01:05:55.630 line:15%
If you truly intend on maintaining this peace,

1500
01:05:55.630 --> 01:05:57.340 line:15%
of seeing this negotiation through

1501
01:05:58.200 --> 01:06:00.610 line:15%
and find that this conflict gives

1502
01:06:00.610 --> 01:06:02.720 line:15%
no benefit to you and your interests,

1503
01:06:03.580 --> 01:06:05.260 line:15%
it would do well to not let that

1504
01:06:05.260 --> 01:06:07.980 line:15%
information find its way to the Bright Queen.

1505
01:06:09.210 --> 01:06:11.680 line:15%
Don't tell her about that?

1506
01:06:11.680 --> 01:06:12.970 line:15%
You don't want to tell her about that?

1507
01:06:12.970 --> 01:06:13.803 line:15%
Why? Why?
I think

1508
01:06:13.803 --> 01:06:16.060 line:15%
it might tip the scales.
Because then there would be

1509
01:06:16.060 --> 01:06:18.340 line:15%
no reason to stop the conflict if they're not

1510
01:06:18.340 --> 01:06:19.740 line:15%
giving all the Beacons back.

1511
01:06:21.170 --> 01:06:23.850 line:15%
It's largely considered within the Dynasty

1512
01:06:23.850 --> 01:06:27.820 line:15%
that these are the religious right of those

1513
01:06:27.820 --> 01:06:32.210 line:15%
that follow the Luxon to find and maintain the Beacons.

1514
01:06:32.210 --> 01:06:34.000 line:15%
And you care more about stopping

1515
01:06:34.000 --> 01:06:35.780 line:15%
this war than serving your Queen?

1516
01:06:38.670 --> 01:06:41.680 line:15%
The Dynasty is where I live.

1517
01:06:42.770 --> 01:06:46.990 line:15%
The Dynasty has many great things it does and provides.

1518
01:06:46.990 --> 01:06:51.990 line:15%
I don't necessarily believe with this theological focus

1519
01:06:52.640 --> 01:06:54.390 line:15%
to the point where it continues

1520
01:06:54.390 --> 01:06:56.380 line:15%
the cycle of warfare and bloodshed.

1521
01:06:56.380 --> 01:06:58.990 line:15%
War is a cycle and an addiction.

1522
01:06:58.990 --> 01:06:59.823 line:15%
Of course.

1523
01:06:59.823 --> 01:07:00.656 line:15%
I've seen it happen many times

1524
01:07:00.656 --> 01:07:01.890 line:15%
and it will continue to happen.

1525
01:07:01.890 --> 01:07:04.000 line:15%
Little to do with its people.

1526
01:07:04.000 --> 01:07:05.312 line:15%
Well.

1527
01:07:05.312 --> 01:07:06.580 line:15%
We're not being watched, right?

1528
01:07:06.580 --> 01:07:07.420 line:15%
We don't have a little floating ball--

1529
01:07:07.420 --> 01:07:10.225 line:15%
Yeah, have we been watched since we've been here?

1530
01:07:10.225 --> 01:07:11.511 line:15%
Whirr, shum, whirr.

1531
01:07:11.511 --> 01:07:13.761 line:15%
(laughter)

1532
01:07:14.750 --> 01:07:16.650 line:15%
Make a reception check.

1533
01:07:16.650 --> 01:07:18.230 line:15%
Oh.
Son of a bitch.

1534
01:07:18.230 --> 01:07:19.370 line:15%
If we've been watched, this is bad--

1535
01:07:19.370 --> 01:07:20.850 line:15%
Of course we're being watched.

1536
01:07:22.750 --> 01:07:24.750 line:15%
Natural one.
Oh, shoot.

1537
01:07:24.750 --> 01:07:25.810 line:15%
Mmkay.
See, we're fine.

1538
01:07:25.810 --> 01:07:27.760 line:15%
You do glance around and you see

1539
01:07:27.760 --> 01:07:29.560 line:15%
nothing of the sort in the vicinity.

1540
01:07:31.730 --> 01:07:34.740 line:15%
Does the Dynasty have us bugged in this house?

1541
01:07:34.740 --> 01:07:38.260 line:15%
It would not surprise me if they, at times, chimed in.

1542
01:07:38.260 --> 01:07:39.680 line:15%
You have been under watch, here and there,

1543
01:07:39.680 --> 01:07:41.430 line:15%
since you've arrived as you were a,

1544
01:07:43.840 --> 01:07:46.960 line:15%
a challenging addition to the proximity.

1545
01:07:46.960 --> 01:07:47.910 line:15%
Were you one of the ones watching us?

1546
01:07:47.910 --> 01:07:49.480 line:15%
Did you ever watch us?
To be specific,

1547
01:07:49.480 --> 01:07:51.390 line:15%
we've seen ourselves being watched.

1548
01:07:51.390 --> 01:07:55.150 line:15%
We were hoping it was you.
At times it was.

1549
01:07:55.150 --> 01:07:57.450 line:15%
Hey.
(gasps) Oh my gosh.

1550
01:07:57.450 --> 01:08:00.120 line:15%
Did you see us when we were changing clothes?

1551
01:08:00.120 --> 01:08:03.220 line:15%
Were you watching us when we were naked?

1552
01:08:03.220 --> 01:08:05.015 line:15%
Jester's naked a lot.

1553
01:08:05.015 --> 01:08:05.848 line:15%
(laughter)

1554
01:08:05.848 --> 01:08:09.780 line:15%
No, but it was part of my assignment when you

1555
01:08:09.780 --> 01:08:12.380 line:15%
first came under my wing to ensure that there wasn't

1556
01:08:15.408 --> 01:08:18.370 line:15%
any chances of undue Empire business

1557
01:08:18.370 --> 01:08:21.290 line:15%
finding its way within the proximity of the Bastion.

1558
01:08:22.430 --> 01:08:23.870 line:15%
Makes sense.
If you chimed in

1559
01:08:23.870 --> 01:08:25.780 line:15%
when we were changing, would you have kept watching

1560
01:08:25.780 --> 01:08:27.340 line:15%
or would you have checked out?

1561
01:08:27.340 --> 01:08:28.440 line:15%
I am more respectful than that

1562
01:08:28.440 --> 01:08:29.890 line:15%
and have no interest in such things.

1563
01:08:29.890 --> 01:08:30.780 line:15%
Why?
Is there one of us

1564
01:08:30.780 --> 01:08:32.450 line:15%
that you would've watched longer than--

1565
01:08:32.450 --> 01:08:33.283 line:15%
(snorting)

1566
01:08:33.283 --> 01:08:34.116 line:15%
Wow.
Wait, okay.

1567
01:08:34.116 --> 01:08:34.990 line:15%
Real question.

1568
01:08:34.990 --> 01:08:35.823 line:15%
And which one?

1569
01:08:35.823 --> 01:08:37.070 line:15%
You can be open here.

1570
01:08:37.070 --> 01:08:38.241 line:15%
So.

1571
01:08:38.241 --> 01:08:39.916 line:15%
(laughter)

1572
01:08:39.916 --> 01:08:41.066 line:15%
How much has he had to drink?

1573
01:08:41.066 --> 01:08:42.430 line:15%
(clapping)

1574
01:08:42.430 --> 01:08:46.460 line:15%
This additional Beacon, where is it now?

1575
01:08:46.460 --> 01:08:47.370 line:15%
We don't know.
We'll tell

1576
01:08:47.370 --> 01:08:51.170 line:15%
if you tell us which one of us is the hottest.

1577
01:08:51.170 --> 01:08:53.613 line:15%
Zone of truth. (laughs)

1578
01:08:53.613 --> 01:08:55.863 line:15%
(laughter)

1579
01:09:01.184 --> 01:09:02.017 line:15%
Oh my gosh, you guys.

1580
01:09:02.017 --> 01:09:03.529 line:15%
Do you want to play seven minutes in the zone of truth?

1581
01:09:03.529 --> 01:09:06.030 line:15%
(laughter)

1582
01:09:06.030 --> 01:09:07.934 line:15%
(imitated buffeting noise)

1583
01:09:07.934 --> 01:09:09.090 line:15%
Seven minutes in--
Epic fantasy,

1584
01:09:09.090 --> 01:09:11.670 line:15%
heroic personalities, fighting against the dangers

1585
01:09:11.670 --> 01:09:14.670 line:15%
of the world to rise the ranks of power and glory to--

1586
01:09:14.670 --> 01:09:15.960 line:15%
Who do you like?
Find out

1587
01:09:15.960 --> 01:09:17.510 line:15%
who wants to make out with somebody else.

1588
01:09:17.510 --> 01:09:20.060 line:15%
This is Dungeons &amp; Dragons.

1589
01:09:20.060 --> 01:09:22.390 line:15%
(laughter)

1590
01:09:22.390 --> 01:09:23.223 line:15%
Don't kid yourselves, I'd win.

1591
01:09:23.223 --> 01:09:24.344 line:15%
I think that's why we're, though.

1592
01:09:24.344 --> 01:09:25.869 line:15%
(laughter)

1593
01:09:25.869 --> 01:09:27.890 line:15%
Yeah, we don't, we don't know where it is.

1594
01:09:27.890 --> 01:09:28.723 line:15%
We've just--

1595
01:09:30.842 --> 01:09:32.060 line:15%
Well, we know where it came from.

1596
01:09:32.060 --> 01:09:36.700 line:15%
I can tell you it's the one they plan to give back,

1597
01:09:37.850 --> 01:09:41.330 line:15%
which I find deeply problematic and have since they

1598
01:09:42.590 --> 01:09:47.230 line:15%
poised that plan because I'm assuming as soon as

1599
01:09:47.230 --> 01:09:50.500 line:15%
the Bright Queen takes one look at it--

1600
01:09:50.500 --> 01:09:52.030 line:15%
Yeah, it's not like a dead goldfish

1601
01:09:52.030 --> 01:09:53.670 line:15%
where you can just, like, swap out another one

1602
01:09:53.670 --> 01:09:55.440 line:15%
and be like, "Here's your goldfish."

1603
01:09:55.440 --> 01:09:57.600 line:15%
Like, she'll know that it's not the same goldfish.

1604
01:09:57.600 --> 01:09:58.433 line:15%
Will she?

1605
01:10:00.776 --> 01:10:01.609 line:15%
Well, it depends.

1606
01:10:01.609 --> 01:10:03.700 line:15%
If they're handing over this new one they've found

1607
01:10:03.700 --> 01:10:07.400 line:15%
or if they're returning the one that was taken

1608
01:10:07.400 --> 01:10:09.700 line:15%
and then planned to keep this new one for themselves.

1609
01:10:09.700 --> 01:10:12.400 line:15%
I mean, there's no way to really know which one is which.

1610
01:10:12.400 --> 01:10:14.530 line:15%
What you're saying, though, is any one of them,

1611
01:10:14.530 --> 01:10:16.020 line:15%
even this one that has been found,

1612
01:10:16.020 --> 01:10:19.330 line:15%
dug up within the Empire's reaches,

1613
01:10:19.330 --> 01:10:21.840 line:15%
would be considered the property of the Dynasty.

1614
01:10:22.840 --> 01:10:27.140 line:15%
By their divine right to own these artifacts that

1615
01:10:27.140 --> 01:10:31.520 line:15%
extend their ability to maintain the cycle of life, yes.

1616
01:10:31.520 --> 01:10:34.518 line:15%
What if these things are all over the world?

1617
01:10:34.518 --> 01:10:35.351 line:15%
I believe they are.

1618
01:10:35.351 --> 01:10:36.220 line:15%
That is the assumption.

1619
01:10:37.240 --> 01:10:38.290 line:15%
And you're telling us you would

1620
01:10:38.290 --> 01:10:42.040 line:15%
prefer to keep this a secret in this room?

1621
01:10:43.110 --> 01:10:46.820 line:15%
I am advising, based on your proclivity

1622
01:10:46.820 --> 01:10:49.320 line:15%
to not continue this conflict

1623
01:10:49.320 --> 01:10:51.480 line:15%
and the lengths at which you've gone

1624
01:10:51.480 --> 01:10:55.780 line:15%
to prevent this war from spreading further and further,

1625
01:10:55.780 --> 01:10:57.880 line:15%
putting yourselves in harm's way to do so,

1626
01:10:58.820 --> 01:11:01.220 line:15%
that if that is what you continually wish to do,

1627
01:11:02.880 --> 01:11:06.140 line:15%
to not notify the Bright Queen

1628
01:11:06.140 --> 01:11:09.110 line:15%
or any other members of the council around her of this.

1629
01:11:10.610 --> 01:11:13.180 line:15%
Would it be advisable

1630
01:11:14.640 --> 01:11:16.200 line:15%
for us to urge--

1631
01:11:17.910 --> 01:11:20.100 line:15%
The Empire to give back--
The Empire to give back

1632
01:11:20.100 --> 01:11:23.610 line:15%
either the correct one or honestly, both?

1633
01:11:24.850 --> 01:11:28.730 line:15%
Or steal it back.

1634
01:11:28.730 --> 01:11:31.660 line:15%
I don't think that would accomplish what we're,

1635
01:11:31.660 --> 01:11:34.722 line:15%
that would just be us plundering them,

1636
01:11:34.722 --> 01:11:37.196 line:15%
they would have no reason to stop.

1637
01:11:37.196 --> 01:11:38.190 line:15%
It's really shiny, though.
Well,

1638
01:11:38.190 --> 01:11:39.690 line:15%
is it in the hands of

1639
01:11:42.770 --> 01:11:43.900 line:15%
the Empire--
Cerberus Assembly.

1640
01:11:43.900 --> 01:11:45.420 line:15%
Yes.
Of the Assembly?

1641
01:11:45.420 --> 01:11:47.760 line:15%
At the top.
That both makes sense

1642
01:11:47.760 --> 01:11:49.210 line:15%
and confirms that you should not

1643
01:11:49.210 --> 01:11:50.940 line:15%
attempt to take it from them.

1644
01:11:50.940 --> 01:11:52.220 line:15%
That's what I thought.

1645
01:11:53.100 --> 01:11:54.210 line:15%
Plus, if we take it from them,

1646
01:11:54.210 --> 01:11:56.200 line:15%
they're just going to blame it on the Kryn.

1647
01:11:57.061 --> 01:11:58.200 line:15%
Start the war more.

1648
01:11:58.200 --> 01:12:00.120 line:15%
You know about these things.

1649
01:12:00.120 --> 01:12:04.440 line:15%
What could they do with it to abuse its powers?

1650
01:12:08.010 --> 01:12:10.400 line:15%
Well, they have some powerful minds in the Assembly.

1651
01:12:11.308 --> 01:12:12.730 line:15%
(liquid sloshing)

1652
01:12:12.730 --> 01:12:14.430 line:15%
Or if they are somewhat dubious,

1653
01:12:15.450 --> 01:12:18.569 line:15%
so does anyone of true intelligence and capability.

1654
01:12:18.569 --> 01:12:21.525 line:15%
(chuckling)

1655
01:12:21.525 --> 01:12:23.875 line:15%
If your necessary choices are moral choices and

1656
01:12:27.979 --> 01:12:29.329 line:15%
in my experience, I'd trust

1657
01:12:31.410 --> 01:12:33.060 line:15%
they would have similar interests

1658
01:12:33.060 --> 01:12:34.840 line:15%
of seeing what it's capable of.

1659
01:12:34.840 --> 01:12:37.190 line:15%
Perhaps they can be reasoned with and perhaps,

1660
01:12:42.980 --> 01:12:44.030 line:15%
I will think on this.

1661
01:12:46.400 --> 01:12:50.660 line:15%
I don't know if, I'm not sure if the Empire

1662
01:12:50.660 --> 01:12:55.500 line:15%
even knows that they're giving the wrong one.

1663
01:12:55.500 --> 01:12:57.670 line:15%
I don't think they talk to each other enough.

1664
01:12:57.670 --> 01:13:00.030 line:15%
I think there may be secrets within secrets.

1665
01:13:00.030 --> 01:13:01.900 line:15%
Oh, there's definitely secrets within secrets.

1666
01:13:01.900 --> 01:13:03.250 line:15%
It's just a matter of who knows--

1667
01:13:03.250 --> 01:13:05.720 line:15%
Just like here.
Too many people not lying,

1668
01:13:05.720 --> 01:13:07.470 line:15%
too many people telling the truth,

1669
01:13:07.470 --> 01:13:08.990 line:15%
then all the truths conflict.

1670
01:13:08.990 --> 01:13:10.700 line:15%
Do you have--
Someone will know.

1671
01:13:10.700 --> 01:13:12.926 line:15%
A relationship with the Assembly?

1672
01:13:12.926 --> 01:13:13.759 line:15%
(groaning)

1673
01:13:13.759 --> 01:13:15.360 line:15%
Some of them.
Somewhat.

1674
01:13:16.390 --> 01:13:17.610 line:15%
Our sense is,

1675
01:13:19.990 --> 01:13:23.260 line:15%
and I'm sure that you all have guessed this yourselves,

1676
01:13:23.260 --> 01:13:27.130 line:15%
but the Assembly has its plans separate from the King.

1677
01:13:28.910 --> 01:13:29.760 line:15%
I would assume.

1678
01:13:33.300 --> 01:13:34.133 line:15%
Hm.

1679
01:13:36.170 --> 01:13:37.980 line:15%
Well, if they have it,

1680
01:13:39.660 --> 01:13:42.190 line:15%
at this moment, I cannot see a path to its retrieval

1681
01:13:42.190 --> 01:13:45.270 line:15%
nor any true benefit in attempting

1682
01:13:45.270 --> 01:13:47.470 line:15%
to blow things up, if you will.

1683
01:13:47.470 --> 01:13:51.940 line:15%
Man, I am so glad I talked to you about this first.

1684
01:13:51.940 --> 01:13:53.310 line:15%
That woulda been super bad if

1685
01:13:53.310 --> 01:13:55.180 line:15%
you'd have just brought that up, woof.

1686
01:13:55.180 --> 01:13:56.270 line:15%
Yup.
I'm really proud of you,

1687
01:13:56.270 --> 01:13:58.062 line:15%
actually, that was really good.

1688
01:13:58.062 --> 01:13:59.380 line:15%
That was another, that was a good move.

1689
01:13:59.380 --> 01:14:01.930 line:15%
There has to be something about this new Beacon, right?

1690
01:14:01.930 --> 01:14:04.680 line:15%
There has to be a reason why they are even offering it up.

1691
01:14:04.680 --> 01:14:06.610 line:15%
It has to be different from the first one.

1692
01:14:06.610 --> 01:14:08.520 line:15%
As long as we have been so

1693
01:14:08.520 --> 01:14:10.650 line:15%
forthright with you already, we

1694
01:14:12.641 --> 01:14:15.230 line:15%
are very skeptical of the intentions

1695
01:14:15.230 --> 01:14:16.830 line:15%
of the Assembly in this meeting.

1696
01:14:18.100 --> 01:14:21.000 line:15%
We are expecting fuckery.

1697
01:14:21.920 --> 01:14:23.640 line:15%
As you should.
As you should?

1698
01:14:25.380 --> 01:14:30.180 line:15%
We would like to pull the rug out from under them.

1699
01:14:31.080 --> 01:14:33.600 line:15%
Not to topple the Empire but

1700
01:14:36.680 --> 01:14:41.100 line:15%
maybe to clear the rot a bit from our nation.

1701
01:14:43.070 --> 01:14:45.130 line:15%
And you believe that the individuals

1702
01:14:45.130 --> 01:14:49.490 line:15%
that make the laws and employ them across your empire

1703
01:14:50.500 --> 01:14:53.050 line:15%
are more capable than these mages?

1704
01:14:54.848 --> 01:14:57.580 line:15%
Do you not think there is perhaps a necessary balance

1705
01:14:57.580 --> 01:15:00.340 line:15%
between the two that maintains the order?

1706
01:15:04.760 --> 01:15:06.370 line:15%
No.
It's the dance

1707
01:15:06.370 --> 01:15:08.750 line:15%
the Cobalt Soul and the Cerberus Assembly have been in

1708
01:15:08.750 --> 01:15:11.230 line:15%
for hundreds of years now at this point.

1709
01:15:11.230 --> 01:15:13.640 line:15%
Understand, the Assembly,

1710
01:15:13.640 --> 01:15:17.070 line:15%
and individuals of which I have no sum of,

1711
01:15:18.650 --> 01:15:22.100 line:15%
seem to be dangerous and calculating,

1712
01:15:25.740 --> 01:15:28.930 line:15%
but anyone of such extended study and pursuits,

1713
01:15:28.930 --> 01:15:32.290 line:15%
I can understand far better and see eye to eye with

1714
01:15:33.160 --> 01:15:34.770 line:15%
than I can a power hungry monarch

1715
01:15:34.770 --> 01:15:37.930 line:15%
who came into their seat through bloodline.

1716
01:15:42.510 --> 01:15:44.690 line:15%
I get the sense that they feel they have found

1717
01:15:44.690 --> 01:15:47.220 line:15%
the upper hand somehow.
Well.

1718
01:15:48.590 --> 01:15:50.150 line:15%
I want to see the conflict end

1719
01:15:50.150 --> 01:15:53.034 line:15%
and I do not get that sense from them.

1720
01:15:53.034 --> 01:15:55.617 line:15%
(gentle music)

1721
01:16:00.220 --> 01:16:03.800 line:15%
What is the biggest danger to

1722
01:16:05.780 --> 01:16:08.074 line:15%
secret research?

1723
01:16:08.074 --> 01:16:10.657 line:15%
(gentle music)

1724
01:16:13.480 --> 01:16:15.960 line:15%
People finding out what you're researching

1725
01:16:15.960 --> 01:16:17.210 line:15%
or what you're--
Discovery.

1726
01:16:17.210 --> 01:16:18.043 line:15%
Discovery.

1727
01:16:19.520 --> 01:16:22.240 line:15%
What better way to avoid discovery

1728
01:16:24.420 --> 01:16:28.040 line:15%
than to find a way to stop a conflict

1729
01:16:28.040 --> 01:16:29.940 line:15%
that pries into what you're doing?

1730
01:16:33.541 --> 01:16:34.374 line:15%
Mm-hmm.

1731
01:16:36.620 --> 01:16:37.570 line:15%
He's got a point.

1732
01:16:41.640 --> 01:16:43.540 line:15%
You are suggesting that they want to

1733
01:16:45.520 --> 01:16:48.700 line:15%
keep their extra.
It could be.

1734
01:16:49.890 --> 01:16:53.350 line:15%
Or they intend to trap whatever it is they're delivering

1735
01:16:53.350 --> 01:16:54.500 line:15%
and gain an upper hand.

1736
01:16:57.310 --> 01:16:58.380 line:15%
Or something else.

1737
01:17:00.120 --> 01:17:01.960 line:15%
I'm but one mind, they are many.

1738
01:17:04.050 --> 01:17:05.390 line:15%
It's likely something else.

1739
01:17:05.390 --> 01:17:07.940 line:15%
We know they can extract things from the Beacons.

1740
01:17:09.977 --> 01:17:10.810 line:15%
Yeah.

1741
01:17:12.020 --> 01:17:13.940 line:15%
Like energy or liquid or something.

1742
01:17:13.940 --> 01:17:15.740 line:15%
Yeah, they made potions out of it.

1743
01:17:17.580 --> 01:17:18.413 line:15%
Really.

1744
01:17:19.650 --> 01:17:21.720 line:15%
And where did you see this?

1745
01:17:21.720 --> 01:17:25.560 line:15%
When we found the, when we were in the Empire, we saw it.

1746
01:17:28.240 --> 01:17:30.500 line:15%
We found a place that they had been doing

1747
01:17:30.500 --> 01:17:32.650 line:15%
some of their research and there was, like,

1748
01:17:34.200 --> 01:17:36.163 line:15%
potions there.
Hm.

1749
01:17:37.990 --> 01:17:38.823 line:15%
Well.

1750
01:17:39.829 --> 01:17:41.550 line:15%
(gentle music)

1751
01:17:41.550 --> 01:17:43.730 line:15%
If you have any means of discovering

1752
01:17:43.730 --> 01:17:45.570 line:15%
more of such experiments that they're

1753
01:17:45.570 --> 01:17:49.000 line:15%
doing in their private chambers,

1754
01:17:49.000 --> 01:17:52.760 line:15%
that would be of definite interest to me.

1755
01:17:52.760 --> 01:17:57.670 line:15%
What if they're willing to give it back

1756
01:17:57.670 --> 01:18:00.420 line:15%
because it's not the one that they found that was empty?

1757
01:18:02.110 --> 01:18:05.220 line:15%
Because Nott looked at it and she got a signal.

1758
01:18:05.220 --> 01:18:07.770 line:15%
What if they drained the other one that they stole?

1759
01:18:09.360 --> 01:18:12.260 line:15%
That would be an astronomical feat based on

1760
01:18:12.260 --> 01:18:16.520 line:15%
the sheer volume of power within each of these Beacons.

1761
01:18:18.043 --> 01:18:21.270 line:15%
That buried one was just sitting there, not absorbing.

1762
01:18:21.270 --> 01:18:22.720 line:15%
Maybe it was absorbing.

1763
01:18:22.720 --> 01:18:24.690 line:15%
The potential lives in a beacon,

1764
01:18:24.690 --> 01:18:26.680 line:15%
thousands, hundreds,

1765
01:18:28.030 --> 01:18:28.863 line:15%
millions?

1766
01:18:29.940 --> 01:18:31.740 line:15%
It would have to depend on who was

1767
01:18:33.240 --> 01:18:35.360 line:15%
consecuted and passed in its presence.

1768
01:18:35.360 --> 01:18:37.820 line:15%
I have no idea.
What does the ritual entail?

1769
01:18:41.731 --> 01:18:43.737 line:15%
They cut the foreskin off?

1770
01:18:45.643 --> 01:18:46.476 line:15%
Mm.

1771
01:18:48.550 --> 01:18:53.550 line:15%
You are guided by an Umavi through a soul binding process.

1772
01:18:53.950 --> 01:18:58.950 line:15%
It is extensive, it entails a bunch of spoken rites.

1773
01:18:59.040 --> 01:19:03.000 line:15%
It is usually observed by many individuals

1774
01:19:03.000 --> 01:19:06.260 line:15%
of various dens, especially if you belong to one.

1775
01:19:06.260 --> 01:19:07.700 line:15%
And often when you are consecuted,

1776
01:19:07.700 --> 01:19:09.200 line:15%
you are given a path to a den.

1777
01:19:11.260 --> 01:19:13.300 line:15%
Oh.
The families are expensive.

1778
01:19:18.150 --> 01:19:20.380 line:15%
I got a question.
Mm-hmm?

1779
01:19:20.380 --> 01:19:22.530 line:15%
In my research, would I have found anything

1780
01:19:22.530 --> 01:19:26.710 line:15%
about Pride's Call that talks about them

1781
01:19:29.678 --> 01:19:32.370 line:15%
having some form of reincarnation

1782
01:19:32.370 --> 01:19:36.170 line:15%
as part of their culture or city--

1783
01:19:36.170 --> 01:19:38.580 line:15%
Pride's Call?
With the dwarven society.

1784
01:19:38.580 --> 01:19:40.830 line:15%
Yeah.
Nothing like that, actually.

1785
01:19:40.830 --> 01:19:43.890 line:15%
Nothing that sounds like--
Mm-mm.

1786
01:19:43.890 --> 01:19:45.320 line:15%
Okay.
Repackaging--

1787
01:19:45.320 --> 01:19:47.860 line:15%
Hypothetically, if we had one of these potions

1788
01:19:47.860 --> 01:19:49.280 line:15%
that they had derived from the Beacon,

1789
01:19:49.280 --> 01:19:50.750 line:15%
what would you do with it?

1790
01:19:50.750 --> 01:19:52.450 line:15%
I would study it, top to bottom.

1791
01:19:53.320 --> 01:19:55.620 line:15%
What could it tell you?
I have no idea.

1792
01:19:55.620 --> 01:19:58.420 line:15%
That would be the purpose of researching it.

1793
01:20:00.540 --> 01:20:01.920 line:15%
Why, do you have one such thing?

1794
01:20:01.920 --> 01:20:04.420 line:15%
I mean--
Let's call this one favor--

1795
01:20:04.420 --> 01:20:07.940 line:15%
Whoa.
Taken care of.

1796
01:20:07.940 --> 01:20:09.380 line:15%
You fucking drop a thing on the

1797
01:20:09.380 --> 01:20:11.560 line:15%
Dynasty every time.
That

1798
01:20:11.560 --> 01:20:15.020 line:15%
would be a favor accepted.
Oh,

1799
01:20:15.020 --> 01:20:18.140 line:15%
he didn't accept your secret.
Do you release it?

1800
01:20:18.140 --> 01:20:18.973 line:15%
Mm.
Mm.

1801
01:20:20.200 --> 01:20:22.350 line:15%
Wow.
Secrets are very valuable.

1802
01:20:22.350 --> 01:20:25.090 line:15%
We're giving them up like candy here.

1803
01:20:25.090 --> 01:20:26.350 line:15%
All you got to do is be nice to us.

1804
01:20:26.350 --> 01:20:28.030 line:15%
We don't have enough people being nice to us.

1805
01:20:28.030 --> 01:20:29.250 line:15%
I have plenty of people being

1806
01:20:29.250 --> 01:20:30.240 line:15%
nice to me.
She's got a point

1807
01:20:30.240 --> 01:20:33.054 line:15%
And the SWAT team bursts in through the windows

1808
01:20:33.054 --> 01:20:34.030 line:15%
(chuckling)

1809
01:20:34.030 --> 01:20:34.863 line:15%
Fuck!

1810
01:20:34.863 --> 01:20:36.085 line:15%
He just sets it aside on the table.

1811
01:20:36.085 --> 01:20:37.190 line:15%
(laughter)

1812
01:20:37.190 --> 01:20:38.690 line:15%
I can commiserate with that.

1813
01:20:40.190 --> 01:20:44.370 line:15%
Honestly, part of the reason I accepted your invitation

1814
01:20:44.370 --> 01:20:46.220 line:15%
was after thinking and realizing that

1815
01:20:48.290 --> 01:20:49.910 line:15%
perhaps it's been awhile since

1816
01:20:49.910 --> 01:20:52.110 line:15%
somebody's extended such niceties to myself.

1817
01:20:54.720 --> 01:20:58.690 line:15%
There are (sighs) elements to a solitary life

1818
01:20:58.690 --> 01:21:01.470 line:15%
that sometimes can be more challenging

1819
01:21:01.470 --> 01:21:03.270 line:15%
once you have a basis of comparison.

1820
01:21:04.951 --> 01:21:05.810 line:15%
The whole returning a favor thing

1821
01:21:05.810 --> 01:21:08.040 line:15%
is kind of a bit in jest.

1822
01:21:08.040 --> 01:21:11.360 line:15%
In all honesty, we do deeply appreciate

1823
01:21:11.360 --> 01:21:12.650 line:15%
all the things that you've done for us

1824
01:21:12.650 --> 01:21:14.000 line:15%
over these past several months.

1825
01:21:14.000 --> 01:21:15.460 line:15%
Yeah, if you ever feel like ditching out here

1826
01:21:15.460 --> 01:21:17.913 line:15%
and traveling with us, just let us know, you know?

1827
01:21:17.913 --> 01:21:18.746 line:15%
(chuckling)

1828
01:21:18.746 --> 01:21:20.740 line:15%
Yeah, well no, she's not joking.

1829
01:21:20.740 --> 01:21:24.370 line:15%
I mean, you know, you said, you said an important part

1830
01:21:24.370 --> 01:21:28.290 line:15%
of what you do is staying alone and I think

1831
01:21:28.290 --> 01:21:30.290 line:15%
we all felt that too before we met each other.

1832
01:21:30.290 --> 01:21:32.410 line:15%
It's true.
Literally.

1833
01:21:32.410 --> 01:21:33.680 line:15%
Very lonely, all of us.

1834
01:21:35.020 --> 01:21:35.853 line:15%
Well,

1835
01:21:36.800 --> 01:21:39.660 line:15%
if I can be of help in some way,

1836
01:21:41.580 --> 01:21:44.300 line:15%
perhaps with your predicament as you were requesting--

1837
01:21:44.300 --> 01:21:45.490 line:15%
Well, I--
Let me know.

1838
01:21:46.910 --> 01:21:49.920 line:15%
There was a woman, a mage,

1839
01:21:49.920 --> 01:21:52.300 line:15%
who helped them turn me into this.

1840
01:21:53.360 --> 01:21:56.005 line:15%
I don't really know anything about her, though.

1841
01:21:56.005 --> 01:21:57.000 line:15%
What was her name?
I don't know.

1842
01:21:57.000 --> 01:21:59.790 line:15%
What'd she look like?
A lady.

1843
01:22:00.630 --> 01:22:02.905 line:15%
Like, what color was her hair?

1844
01:22:02.905 --> 01:22:06.260 line:15%
I don't know, I was, like, mostly dead when I saw her.

1845
01:22:06.260 --> 01:22:07.320 line:15%
You, Caleb--
Was she ugly?

1846
01:22:07.320 --> 01:22:08.860 line:15%
Was she pretty?
I mean,

1847
01:22:08.860 --> 01:22:10.920 line:15%
not as pretty as you, but she was pretty.

1848
01:22:10.920 --> 01:22:12.770 line:15%
Your specialty in the arcane

1849
01:22:12.770 --> 01:22:14.770 line:15%
lies in the realm of transmutation, yes?

1850
01:22:16.250 --> 01:22:17.083 line:15%
Primarily.

1851
01:22:19.180 --> 01:22:23.100 line:15%
Although, I, similar to you, I'm an avid reader.

1852
01:22:24.190 --> 01:22:27.340 line:15%
I'm very curious about everything, everything.

1853
01:22:27.340 --> 01:22:29.790 line:15%
He's been studying something to help me lately.

1854
01:22:30.680 --> 01:22:33.657 line:15%
Working on equations.
Yeah.

1855
01:22:33.657 --> 01:22:35.280 line:15%
I've been noodling about with something.

1856
01:22:36.250 --> 01:22:37.800 line:15%
Perhaps I can offer some aid.

1857
01:22:39.770 --> 01:22:41.810 line:15%
Then we would be willing to accept that.

1858
01:22:43.840 --> 01:22:46.250 line:15%
I think we have a full plate for the next couple of days,

1859
01:22:46.250 --> 01:22:49.740 line:15%
but hopefully it will be wrapped up safely.

1860
01:22:49.740 --> 01:22:51.370 line:15%
You just show him now, you just show him now.

1861
01:22:51.370 --> 01:22:52.580 line:15%
Well, he's a little drunk.

1862
01:22:52.580 --> 01:22:54.970 line:15%
He might not be able to--
Oh, right.

1863
01:22:54.970 --> 01:22:56.320 line:15%
Maybe we could get into the hot tub

1864
01:22:56.320 --> 01:22:58.130 line:15%
and sorta look through the pages.

1865
01:22:58.130 --> 01:22:59.730 line:15%
That makes the drunk worse.
Does it?

1866
01:22:59.730 --> 01:23:00.700 line:15%
Yes.
Getting in the hot tub?

1867
01:23:00.700 --> 01:23:01.780 line:15%
Then let's do it!

1868
01:23:03.540 --> 01:23:04.457 line:15%
I'm game.

1869
01:23:05.451 --> 01:23:06.284 line:15%
Come get in the hot tub.
You seriously

1870
01:23:06.284 --> 01:23:07.450 line:15%
have a hot tub?
We really, really do.

1871
01:23:07.450 --> 01:23:08.580 line:15%
I mean, do you want to see it?

1872
01:23:08.580 --> 01:23:10.110 line:15%
Yeah.
It's very nice.

1873
01:23:10.110 --> 01:23:13.410 line:15%
It is really great, you will like it.

1874
01:23:13.410 --> 01:23:14.930 line:15%
Like a bricked-in hole in the ground

1875
01:23:14.930 --> 01:23:16.970 line:15%
that we heated with our magic

1876
01:23:16.970 --> 01:23:18.830 line:15%
It's--
Or with fire.

1877
01:23:18.830 --> 01:23:20.743 line:15%
I'm certainly curious.

1878
01:23:20.743 --> 01:23:21.670 line:15%
(claps) He's doing it.

1879
01:23:23.221 --> 01:23:24.054 line:15%
He's doing it.
Let's do it.

1880
01:23:24.054 --> 01:23:25.340 line:15%
We've worked very hard on that hot tub.

1881
01:23:25.340 --> 01:23:26.540 line:15%
You're right, I'm sorry--
It's very nice.

1882
01:23:26.540 --> 01:23:28.440 line:15%
I'm not trying to minimize it.
Don't minimize it.

1883
01:23:28.440 --> 01:23:29.273 line:15%
It's spectacular.
I'm not.

1884
01:23:29.273 --> 01:23:30.140 line:15%
It's a great hot tub.
Yeah.

1885
01:23:30.140 --> 01:23:31.830 line:15%
And it's got a good view, you see up into the trees.

1886
01:23:31.830 --> 01:23:33.470 line:15%
The tree roots, like, the way that they've

1887
01:23:33.470 --> 01:23:35.250 line:15%
been expertly carved--
It's true, beautiful.

1888
01:23:35.250 --> 01:23:38.310 line:15%
Do you want to borrow some knickers or something?

1889
01:23:38.310 --> 01:23:41.610 line:15%
You want to go naked?
I just wanted to see it.

1890
01:23:41.610 --> 01:23:44.474 line:15%
Oh.
You want to get in.

1891
01:23:44.474 --> 01:23:45.340 line:15%
(laughter)

1892
01:23:45.340 --> 01:23:46.886 line:15%
Make a persuasion check.

1893
01:23:46.886 --> 01:23:49.136 line:15%
(laughter)

1894
01:23:50.360 --> 01:23:51.410 line:15%
Do it.
Peer pressure.

1895
01:23:51.410 --> 01:23:52.243 line:15%
15.

1896
01:23:56.120 --> 01:23:58.440 line:15%
A small dip, maybe.
Ooh.

1897
01:23:58.440 --> 01:24:00.320 line:15%
Like, put your feet in.
He's a feet dangler, yeah.

1898
01:24:00.320 --> 01:24:02.034 line:15%
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Sold him.

1899
01:24:02.034 --> 01:24:04.550 line:15%
Pulls the pants up, tucks them right above the knees.

1900
01:24:04.550 --> 01:24:07.900 line:15%
So, he takes his boots off and rolls up the legs

1901
01:24:07.900 --> 01:24:09.190 line:15%
just beyond the knee and does

1902
01:24:09.190 --> 01:24:10.150 line:15%
place his feet into the water.

1903
01:24:10.150 --> 01:24:10.983 line:15%
How's his feet look?

1904
01:24:10.983 --> 01:24:12.860 line:15%
Are they, like, super delicate

1905
01:24:12.860 --> 01:24:15.230 line:15%
from where he just, like, floats all the time?

1906
01:24:15.230 --> 01:24:16.973 line:15%
Like, are they atrophied from not--

1907
01:24:16.973 --> 01:24:18.681 line:15%
(talking over each other)

1908
01:24:18.681 --> 01:24:20.516 line:15%
(laughter)

1909
01:24:20.516 --> 01:24:23.710 line:15%
It's like easily--
How detailed are your notes?

1910
01:24:23.710 --> 01:24:26.820 line:15%
They are very, very well kept, soft feet

1911
01:24:26.820 --> 01:24:29.310 line:15%
from a man who takes care of himself

1912
01:24:29.310 --> 01:24:31.390 line:15%
in the nobility, sure, there you go.

1913
01:24:31.390 --> 01:24:33.027 line:15%
Well manicured.

1914
01:24:33.027 --> 01:24:34.310 line:15%
(laughter)

1915
01:24:34.310 --> 01:24:36.909 line:15%
You can see a glass slipper just fitting right on.

1916
01:24:36.909 --> 01:24:38.975 line:15%
(talking over each other)

1917
01:24:38.975 --> 01:24:40.861 line:15%
(laughter)

1918
01:24:40.861 --> 01:24:42.650 line:15%
(laughs) Writing it in your notes.

1919
01:24:42.650 --> 01:24:43.760 line:15%
Jesus, you guys.

1920
01:24:43.760 --> 01:24:46.741 line:15%
Underneath his floating robes, he just has glass slippers.

1921
01:24:46.741 --> 01:24:47.670 line:15%
(laughter)

1922
01:24:47.670 --> 01:24:48.503 line:15%
Just floating.

1923
01:24:48.503 --> 01:24:50.097 line:15%
(laughter)

1924
01:24:50.097 --> 01:24:51.310 line:15%
That's why he does, that's why he floats,

1925
01:24:51.310 --> 01:24:52.798 line:15%
doesn't want to break them.

1926
01:24:52.798 --> 01:24:53.977 line:15%
I need some alcohol in this.

1927
01:24:53.977 --> 01:24:54.810 line:15%
(laughter)

1928
01:24:54.810 --> 01:24:55.790 line:15%
Hyperbaric fun chamber.

1929
01:24:55.790 --> 01:24:56.830 line:15%
Something occurred to me when you were

1930
01:24:56.830 --> 01:24:59.860 line:15%
talking about lives and reborn and stuff like that.

1931
01:24:59.860 --> 01:25:02.150 line:15%
In your den or when you were growing up,

1932
01:25:02.150 --> 01:25:05.270 line:15%
wait, how many people live here in Xhorhas?

1933
01:25:05.270 --> 01:25:07.460 line:15%
Like, thousands, right?
In Xhorhas,

1934
01:25:07.460 --> 01:25:10.310 line:15%
between the Dynasty's influence in particular,

1935
01:25:12.200 --> 01:25:17.200 line:15%
hm, somewhere between, in the neighborhood of 300,000.

1936
01:25:17.350 --> 01:25:19.760 line:15%
Whoa.
Within the Dynasty.

1937
01:25:19.760 --> 01:25:22.820 line:15%
That involves multiple cities, probably more than that.

1938
01:25:22.820 --> 01:25:24.530 line:15%
There are many of those who exist

1939
01:25:24.530 --> 01:25:26.180 line:15%
outside of the Dynasty's purview.

1940
01:25:27.165 --> 01:25:27.998 line:15%
I just thought maybe you might

1941
01:25:27.998 --> 01:25:30.590 line:15%
have heard of a friend of ours, maybe.

1942
01:25:30.590 --> 01:25:35.560 line:15%
Have you ever heard of someone named Lucien or Nonagon?

1943
01:25:38.026 --> 01:25:39.320 line:15%
I cannot say I have.

1944
01:25:39.320 --> 01:25:41.470 line:15%
Hm.
My apologies.

1945
01:25:42.330 --> 01:25:43.163 line:15%
All right.

1946
01:25:44.340 --> 01:25:45.780 line:15%
Worth a shot.

1947
01:25:45.780 --> 01:25:47.780 line:15%
Yeah, there was this story he told me.

1948
01:25:49.198 --> 01:25:50.031 line:15%
What?

1949
01:25:51.167 --> 01:25:52.000 line:15%
It was right before he died.

1950
01:25:52.000 --> 01:25:53.420 line:15%
There was this story he told me

1951
01:25:53.420 --> 01:25:55.910 line:15%
about how he convinced some town he was a god.

1952
01:25:57.130 --> 01:25:58.490 line:15%
Mollytown.
Somewhere.

1953
01:25:58.490 --> 01:26:00.637 line:15%
Yeah, somewhere out there.
Molly has a cult.

1954
01:26:00.637 --> 01:26:02.350 line:15%
Huh?
Molly has a cult.

1955
01:26:02.350 --> 01:26:03.300 line:15%
Molly has a cult.

1956
01:26:04.170 --> 01:26:05.540 line:15%
Somewhere out there, there is a town

1957
01:26:05.540 --> 01:26:08.440 line:15%
that thinks Molly is the shit.

1958
01:26:08.440 --> 01:26:09.740 line:15%
Why did they think that about him?

1959
01:26:09.740 --> 01:26:11.490 line:15%
Do you know more about this story?

1960
01:26:12.340 --> 01:26:15.160 line:15%
I vaguely remember it and I feel like

1961
01:26:15.160 --> 01:26:16.450 line:15%
it always made me laugh.

1962
01:26:16.450 --> 01:26:18.770 line:15%
Yeah, it was actually a good story.

1963
01:26:18.770 --> 01:26:20.460 line:15%
We're all in the hot tub by now, right?

1964
01:26:20.460 --> 01:26:21.293 line:15%
Yeah.
Yeah.

1965
01:26:21.293 --> 01:26:22.770 line:15%
You've all lined in front of the hot tub

1966
01:26:22.770 --> 01:26:24.940 line:15%
and he just has his feet over the edge.

1967
01:26:24.940 --> 01:26:27.050 line:15%
Yeah, I think that, uh--

1968
01:26:27.050 --> 01:26:27.883 line:15%
(chuckling)

1969
01:26:27.883 --> 01:26:29.020 line:15%
Nott's in a hoodie on the bench.

1970
01:26:30.765 --> 01:26:32.470 line:15%
I'm just making notes on improvement for the hot tub.

1971
01:26:32.470 --> 01:26:34.537 line:15%
I've got plans for this thing.

1972
01:26:34.537 --> 01:26:35.370 line:15%
It's going to be great.
Wonder if

1973
01:26:35.370 --> 01:26:37.115 line:15%
we strung up lights from the roots--

1974
01:26:37.115 --> 01:26:38.073 line:15%
That's what I was thinking.

1975
01:26:38.073 --> 01:26:39.090 line:15%
(talking over each other)

1976
01:26:39.090 --> 01:26:40.777 line:15%
Plus I'm going to try and get some

1977
01:26:40.777 --> 01:26:42.020 line:15%
(talking over each other)

1978
01:26:42.020 --> 01:26:44.970 line:15%
that smells really good, so you'll have always have--

1979
01:26:44.970 --> 01:26:47.330 line:15%
Caleb sends the globules of light

1980
01:26:47.330 --> 01:26:49.540 line:15%
to sort of hover around in the roots

1981
01:26:49.540 --> 01:26:51.190 line:15%
Can you make them change colors?

1982
01:26:52.340 --> 01:26:55.550 line:15%
Can you make them rotate through the color spectrum?

1983
01:26:55.550 --> 01:26:57.119 line:15%
Oh Jesus Christ.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1984
01:26:57.119 --> 01:26:57.992 line:15%
Do it.

1985
01:26:57.992 --> 01:26:59.726 line:15%
(clunking)

1986
01:26:59.726 --> 01:27:01.460 line:15%
(laughter)

1987
01:27:01.460 --> 01:27:02.776 line:15%
Did you just go (stomps)?
Yeah.

1988
01:27:02.776 --> 01:27:04.191 line:15%
Yeah. (laughs)

1989
01:27:04.191 --> 01:27:05.290 line:15%
(laughter)

1990
01:27:05.290 --> 01:27:06.820 line:15%
Send forth the disco.

1991
01:27:07.797 --> 01:27:08.630 line:15%
Does it work?
They're amber.

1992
01:27:08.630 --> 01:27:09.859 line:15%
Do they work?
Yeah, they do.

1993
01:27:09.859 --> 01:27:11.060 line:15%
(cheering)

1994
01:27:11.060 --> 01:27:12.280 line:15%
Moody.
It's

1995
01:27:12.280 --> 01:27:14.030 line:15%
simple enough to do with a cantrip.

1996
01:27:15.610 --> 01:27:17.530 line:15%
Hey, Caduceus?
Yeah?

1997
01:27:17.530 --> 01:27:19.550 line:15%
While we're getting real and shit,

1998
01:27:21.430 --> 01:27:24.480 line:15%
why have you never wanted to scry on any of your siblings?

1999
01:27:26.441 --> 01:27:27.274 line:15%
(tankard clanking)

2000
01:27:27.274 --> 01:27:28.270 line:15%
You've been separated from them.

2001
01:27:28.270 --> 01:27:31.110 line:15%
They went off looking for these things.

2002
01:27:33.300 --> 01:27:34.160 line:15%
Why not check in?

2003
01:27:35.810 --> 01:27:38.250 line:15%
As the token sober person in this group.

2004
01:27:38.250 --> 01:27:40.120 line:15%
I'm also sober.
Are you also sober?

2005
01:27:40.120 --> 01:27:41.304 line:15%
Yeah.
Have I

2006
01:27:41.304 --> 01:27:42.137 line:15%
not noticed that you haven't been drinking?

2007
01:27:42.137 --> 01:27:44.630 line:15%
I don't drink.
She just drinks milk.

2008
01:27:44.630 --> 01:27:46.720 line:15%
It's that low perception, yeah.

2009
01:27:46.720 --> 01:27:48.800 line:15%
Token sober person who's just really not been

2010
01:27:48.800 --> 01:27:50.430 line:15%
paying attention to what you've been drinking.

2011
01:27:50.430 --> 01:27:53.140 line:15%
It's okay, I always seem slightly drunk anyway, I think.

2012
01:27:53.140 --> 01:27:54.440 line:15%
It's part of your charm.

2013
01:27:57.990 --> 01:28:00.610 line:15%
I don't know, it's either,

2014
01:28:03.348 --> 01:28:05.530 line:15%
if you had asked me that a month ago,

2015
01:28:05.530 --> 01:28:07.680 line:15%
I would've said, "Because I don't need to."

2016
01:28:09.290 --> 01:28:10.710 line:15%
Why?

2017
01:28:10.710 --> 01:28:14.180 line:15%
Because I'm on this path, it's the right path, and--

2018
01:28:16.960 --> 01:28:18.310 line:15%
But we're asking you now.

2019
01:28:21.240 --> 01:28:23.040 line:15%
I think I'm on this path

2020
01:28:23.040 --> 01:28:24.790 line:15%
and I do think it's the right path.

2021
01:28:27.230 --> 01:28:28.240 line:15%
Maybe I'm afraid.

2022
01:28:30.230 --> 01:28:32.660 line:15%
Afraid something happened to them?

2023
01:28:32.660 --> 01:28:34.070 line:15%
Afraid that if something did

2024
01:28:34.070 --> 01:28:37.160 line:15%
happen to them, what would it mean?

2025
01:28:39.310 --> 01:28:40.143 line:15%
I,

2026
01:28:41.950 --> 01:28:46.460 line:15%
I don't want to open the envelope, so to say,

2027
01:28:48.588 --> 01:28:52.250 line:15%
before it's time and be hurt before I'm there.

2028
01:28:54.230 --> 01:28:55.750 line:15%
I'd rather trust

2029
01:28:57.860 --> 01:28:59.090 line:15%
and try to

2030
01:29:01.450 --> 01:29:02.370 line:15%
process the fear.

2031
01:29:03.610 --> 01:29:04.610 line:15%
Fear is kind of new.

2032
01:29:08.620 --> 01:29:10.090 line:15%
For the record, I'm,

2033
01:29:11.390 --> 01:29:12.440 line:15%
my home is dying,

2034
01:29:14.020 --> 01:29:17.230 line:15%
slowly, up north.
Sorry to hear that.

2035
01:29:19.140 --> 01:29:20.040 line:15%
I have been on a

2036
01:29:21.900 --> 01:29:25.040 line:15%
quest, sent by my goddess to

2037
01:29:26.330 --> 01:29:31.330 line:15%
fix my home, to bring it back to life, to replenish it.

2038
01:29:34.410 --> 01:29:35.990 line:15%
My family, all my family,

2039
01:29:37.890 --> 01:29:41.180 line:15%
already begun this quest without me and

2040
01:29:42.770 --> 01:29:44.770 line:15%
I do not know if they are alive or dead,

2041
01:29:45.950 --> 01:29:49.710 line:15%
but this is the quest and I was given these people

2042
01:29:51.250 --> 01:29:52.100 line:15%
and I have

2043
01:29:53.990 --> 01:29:55.020 line:15%
done my best to

2044
01:29:56.360 --> 01:30:00.560 line:15%
support them as they have blossomed into heroes.

2045
01:30:00.560 --> 01:30:04.450 line:15%
And I thought I was going to save my home

2046
01:30:04.450 --> 01:30:07.740 line:15%
and regain my family and that would be my reward

2047
01:30:07.740 --> 01:30:09.940 line:15%
and now I'm, (sighs)

2048
01:30:12.410 --> 01:30:15.800 line:15%
this world has changed me, I don't know anymore.

2049
01:30:17.483 --> 01:30:19.460 line:15%
I don't know what is going to happen,

2050
01:30:21.790 --> 01:30:23.010 line:15%
not because I think that

2051
01:30:25.370 --> 01:30:27.800 line:15%
I've been lied to or been given the,

2052
01:30:30.190 --> 01:30:34.550 line:15%
I don't necessarily believe that I understand

2053
01:30:34.550 --> 01:30:36.350 line:15%
what it is I've been asked to do yet

2054
01:30:37.410 --> 01:30:39.860 line:15%
and I don't understand what it is I want anymore.

2055
01:30:41.660 --> 01:30:43.990 line:15%
And that has shaken me,

2056
01:30:45.860 --> 01:30:47.750 line:15%
but this is a very big world.

2057
01:30:48.953 --> 01:30:51.220 line:15%
(chuckles) Ah, it's been a lot.

2058
01:30:53.460 --> 01:30:54.860 line:15%
It's been nice to be useful.

2059
01:30:56.288 --> 01:30:57.520 line:15%
(throat clearing)

2060
01:30:57.520 --> 01:30:59.490 line:15%
It's good to be useful.

2061
01:30:59.490 --> 01:31:02.120 line:15%
These are good people, despite themselves.

2062
01:31:03.263 --> 01:31:05.596 line:15%
(chuckling)

2063
01:31:06.740 --> 01:31:09.580 line:15%
Faith is a strange thing.
It is.

2064
01:31:09.580 --> 01:31:11.580 line:15%
That's why I find no use for it.

2065
01:31:11.580 --> 01:31:13.290 line:15%
I understand.
But

2066
01:31:15.080 --> 01:31:17.240 line:15%
I hope you find what it is you're looking for.

2067
01:31:18.770 --> 01:31:21.790 line:15%
Thank you, I'll find something, at the very least,

2068
01:31:21.790 --> 01:31:23.490 line:15%
and whatever it is will be,

2069
01:31:24.923 --> 01:31:26.360 line:15%
in the end, what I was looking for.

2070
01:31:29.810 --> 01:31:31.750 line:15%
If there is any way I can be helpful,

2071
01:31:33.330 --> 01:31:35.170 line:15%
you know how to contact me.

2072
01:31:35.170 --> 01:31:38.263 line:15%
He looks knowingly at Jester.

2073
01:31:38.263 --> 01:31:40.596 line:15%
(chuckling)

2074
01:31:41.521 --> 01:31:44.120 line:15%
(laughs) Have you ever been doing something

2075
01:31:44.120 --> 01:31:46.090 line:15%
that you were really embarrassed about

2076
01:31:46.090 --> 01:31:49.435 line:15%
when I was talking to you?

2077
01:31:49.435 --> 01:31:51.700 line:15%
(giggling)

2078
01:31:51.700 --> 01:31:52.650 line:15%
Not particularly.

2079
01:31:53.534 --> 01:31:55.867 line:15%
(chuckling)

2080
01:31:57.597 --> 01:31:58.922 line:15%
(laughs) Insight check.

2081
01:31:58.922 --> 01:32:01.130 line:15%
(laughter)

2082
01:32:01.130 --> 01:32:02.804 line:15%
(clapping)

2083
01:32:02.804 --> 01:32:03.685 line:15%
Make an insight check.

2084
01:32:03.685 --> 01:32:04.518 line:15%
(laughter)

2085
01:32:04.518 --> 01:32:06.483 line:15%
Ya pooping?
Ya pooping?

2086
01:32:06.483 --> 01:32:07.993 line:15%
(talking over each other)

2087
01:32:07.993 --> 01:32:09.143 line:15%
Ah.
Okay, okay,

2088
01:32:09.143 --> 01:32:10.172 line:15%
okay, okay.
Uh huh, uh huh.

2089
01:32:10.172 --> 01:32:11.410 line:15%
Insight?
Yes.

2090
01:32:11.410 --> 01:32:12.630 line:15%
18.
18.

2091
01:32:15.423 --> 01:32:16.256 line:15%
(laughter)

2092
01:32:16.256 --> 01:32:17.747 line:15%
(clapping)

2093
01:32:17.747 --> 01:32:19.890 line:15%
This whisper is going to be, "He was pooping."

2094
01:32:22.190 --> 01:32:23.834 line:15%
Oh, guys.

2095
01:32:23.834 --> 01:32:26.885 line:15%
(talking over each other)
(laughter)

2096
01:32:26.885 --> 01:32:28.770 line:15%
You guys, D&amp;D Beyond will feature

2097
01:32:28.770 --> 01:32:30.490 line:15%
a lot of the stuff that's coming up

2098
01:32:30.490 --> 01:32:33.660 line:15%
in the Wildemount Explorer's Guide.

2099
01:32:35.645 --> 01:32:37.580 line:15%
Did you, okay.
Anyway.

2100
01:32:37.580 --> 01:32:39.160 line:15%
The evening draws late.

2101
01:32:39.160 --> 01:32:42.750 line:15%
I should probably return to my home.

2102
01:32:44.370 --> 01:32:45.585 line:15%
Thank you--
You could

2103
01:32:45.585 --> 01:32:46.418 line:15%
spend the night here.

2104
01:32:46.418 --> 01:32:49.080 line:15%
I live not far from here.

2105
01:32:49.080 --> 01:32:51.460 line:15%
How come we never seen your house?

2106
01:32:51.460 --> 01:32:52.750 line:15%
Well, perhaps--
Next time?

2107
01:32:52.750 --> 01:32:55.810 line:15%
Perhaps if you wanted to discuss

2108
01:32:55.810 --> 01:32:58.250 line:15%
this equation you're working on--

2109
01:32:58.250 --> 01:32:59.650 line:15%
Yes, what's your address?

2110
01:33:00.550 --> 01:33:01.650 line:15%
I'll show it to you.

2111
01:33:02.670 --> 01:33:04.840 line:15%
Easier to show than to describe, really.

2112
01:33:04.840 --> 01:33:06.760 line:15%
Sure.
Let me know when

2113
01:33:06.760 --> 01:33:08.780 line:15%
and I'll come show you to my place.

2114
01:33:08.780 --> 01:33:10.940 line:15%
Okay.
But.

2115
01:33:10.940 --> 01:33:13.034 line:15%
He pulls his legs outta the water.

2116
01:33:13.034 --> 01:33:14.492 line:15%
(clears throat)

2117
01:33:14.492 --> 01:33:16.830 line:15%
Are they shriveled?
Hee hee hee hee.

2118
01:33:16.830 --> 01:33:20.400 line:15%
In the natural way a foot would be after spending,

2119
01:33:20.400 --> 01:33:22.480 line:15%
you know, 30 minutes in a hot tub, sure.

2120
01:33:22.480 --> 01:33:23.749 line:15%
A natural feet.

2121
01:33:23.749 --> 01:33:25.310 line:15%
(laughter)

2122
01:33:25.310 --> 01:33:27.750 line:15%
I accidentally, like, brush up against one

2123
01:33:27.750 --> 01:33:29.493 line:15%
to see if it's an illusion.

2124
01:33:29.493 --> 01:33:30.326 line:15%
(chuckling)

2125
01:33:30.326 --> 01:33:31.507 line:15%
No, it's a foot.

2126
01:33:31.507 --> 01:33:33.323 line:15%
(laughter)

2127
01:33:33.323 --> 01:33:34.821 line:15%
Oh, sorry, sorry.

2128
01:33:34.821 --> 01:33:36.230 line:15%
(laughter)

2129
01:33:36.230 --> 01:33:37.670 line:15%
Brush up against it.

2130
01:33:38.996 --> 01:33:39.829 line:15%
(laughter)

2131
01:33:39.829 --> 01:33:41.600 line:15%
You guys are so weird.
Sorry.

2132
01:33:42.463 --> 01:33:43.725 line:15%
(laughter)

2133
01:33:43.725 --> 01:33:44.860 line:15%
I thought that was a piece of soap,

2134
01:33:44.860 --> 01:33:48.390 line:15%
I was picking it up and didn't want ya to slip on it.

2135
01:33:48.390 --> 01:33:50.569 line:15%
I feel like you're over apologizing.

2136
01:33:50.569 --> 01:33:52.260 line:15%
(laughter)

2137
01:33:52.260 --> 01:33:53.093 line:15%
It's fine.

2138
01:33:54.630 --> 01:33:58.580 line:15%
Anyway, he goes and goes ahead and replaces his mantle

2139
01:33:58.580 --> 01:34:00.880 line:15%
and returns to the front door and says,

2140
01:34:02.090 --> 01:34:02.923 line:15%
"This was nice.

2141
01:34:04.240 --> 01:34:05.540 line:15%
"Thank you."
Thank you!

2142
01:34:06.750 --> 01:34:09.190 line:15%
That was really fun.
Could you,

2143
01:34:11.170 --> 01:34:12.100 line:15%
could we walk, could you show me

2144
01:34:12.100 --> 01:34:14.810 line:15%
where you live so we know where to go?

2145
01:34:14.810 --> 01:34:16.140 line:15%
Sure, come with.
Yeah.

2146
01:34:16.140 --> 01:34:20.000 line:15%
I'm coming, too.
All right.

2147
01:34:20.000 --> 01:34:21.890 line:15%
I'm going to stay here.
Yeah, let them go.

2148
01:34:21.890 --> 01:34:23.970 line:15%
Watch from the window.
It's too weird.

2149
01:34:23.970 --> 01:34:25.770 line:15%
He leads you outside and as he steps off

2150
01:34:25.770 --> 01:34:29.320 line:15%
of the threshold of the front door,

2151
01:34:29.320 --> 01:34:31.600 line:15%
you watch him lift back up into his

2152
01:34:31.600 --> 01:34:34.890 line:15%
general hovering persona, shoulders held aloft.

2153
01:34:37.600 --> 01:34:40.790 line:15%
He guides you through the neighborhood,,

2154
01:34:40.790 --> 01:34:41.830 line:15%
the path you would take to the Bastion

2155
01:34:41.830 --> 01:34:43.520 line:15%
that curves into the neighborhood to where your house is,

2156
01:34:43.520 --> 01:34:45.500 line:15%
it's past that circle and then it leads

2157
01:34:45.500 --> 01:34:47.800 line:15%
deeper into an area that would be

2158
01:34:47.800 --> 01:34:50.450 line:15%
the equivalent of a Rosohna gated community, I guess.

2159
01:34:51.340 --> 01:34:53.550 line:15%
There are guards there, there are folks that are,

2160
01:34:53.550 --> 01:34:55.650 line:15%
you know, guarding an estate and there is,

2161
01:34:57.100 --> 01:34:58.550 line:15%
it's, as opposed to a singular,

2162
01:34:58.550 --> 01:34:59.510 line:15%
you're used to like the candles,

2163
01:34:59.510 --> 01:35:02.050 line:15%
this large, elaborate, you know, wizard towers.

2164
01:35:03.110 --> 01:35:05.680 line:15%
His estate is three towers that are shorter,

2165
01:35:05.680 --> 01:35:06.930 line:15%
but they're all connected by walkways

2166
01:35:06.930 --> 01:35:08.830 line:15%
and they're different heights.
Ooh.

2167
01:35:10.040 --> 01:35:13.040 line:15%
And atop the--
He's got a fun house.

2168
01:35:13.040 --> 01:35:15.010 line:15%
Atop of the tallest one, you can see there

2169
01:35:15.010 --> 01:35:17.410 line:15%
what looks at first like a weather vane.

2170
01:35:17.410 --> 01:35:18.860 line:15%
Instead, you can see is a contraption

2171
01:35:18.860 --> 01:35:23.630 line:15%
that seems to have a series of metallic rings inside

2172
01:35:23.630 --> 01:35:26.440 line:15%
that all are smaller and smaller and smaller within

2173
01:35:26.440 --> 01:35:29.520 line:15%
that slowly, like, rotate on its own

2174
01:35:29.520 --> 01:35:30.980 line:15%
in a way that you're not understand its purpose

2175
01:35:30.980 --> 01:35:32.510 line:15%
or really what it does but it's unique

2176
01:35:32.510 --> 01:35:35.340 line:15%
and it's engineered to be

2177
01:35:37.610 --> 01:35:38.460 line:15%
strangely pretty.

2178
01:35:40.720 --> 01:35:44.180 line:15%
You can see the brick exterior of it falls,

2179
01:35:44.180 --> 01:35:47.040 line:15%
it looks gray, but what little bit of light there is

2180
01:35:47.040 --> 01:35:50.650 line:15%
as you walk past, you can see now the,

2181
01:35:50.650 --> 01:35:53.500 line:15%
there's a slight iridescent almost quality

2182
01:35:53.500 --> 01:35:55.160 line:15%
to the exterior of the bricks

2183
01:35:55.160 --> 01:35:57.160 line:15%
that are laid at the base of the towers.

2184
01:35:58.840 --> 01:35:59.940 line:15%
He just points to it and goes,

2185
01:35:59.940 --> 01:36:03.740 line:15%
"This is where you can find me most of the time--

2186
01:36:04.660 --> 01:36:06.100 line:15%
This is--
Ever.

2187
01:36:06.100 --> 01:36:08.130 line:15%
Fascinating, is this to do with

2188
01:36:08.130 --> 01:36:11.550 line:15%
the turning of the heavens or--

2189
01:36:11.550 --> 01:36:15.820 line:15%
This has to do more with the adjusting of the,

2190
01:36:17.800 --> 01:36:18.633 line:15%
how do I put it,

2191
01:36:19.500 --> 01:36:23.800 line:15%
there are almost ley lines of energy

2192
01:36:23.800 --> 01:36:27.260 line:15%
that themselves span like a net across all of Exandria

2193
01:36:28.340 --> 01:36:32.290 line:15%
and these ley lines sometimes shift and swell

2194
01:36:32.290 --> 01:36:35.540 line:15%
and expand and reduce based on the seasons,

2195
01:36:35.540 --> 01:36:37.859 line:15%
based on the time of year, based on

2196
01:36:37.859 --> 01:36:42.080 line:15%
celestial gatherings and alignments.

2197
01:36:42.080 --> 01:36:44.210 line:15%
This is part of a device that just

2198
01:36:44.210 --> 01:36:46.070 line:15%
keeps track of it.
Mirrors it.

2199
01:36:47.469 --> 01:36:50.290 line:15%
(inhales) Well, now we know where you live.

2200
01:36:51.710 --> 01:36:53.210 line:15%
I would like to take you up on your offer

2201
01:36:53.210 --> 01:36:56.960 line:15%
to examine that thing that Nott and I are working on.

2202
01:36:56.960 --> 01:37:01.630 line:15%
I have a number of things, including some souvenirs

2203
01:37:01.630 --> 01:37:06.080 line:15%
from inside the Happy Fun Ball we told you about.

2204
01:37:07.257 --> 01:37:08.650 line:15%
I'm very curious about that.

2205
01:37:08.650 --> 01:37:10.850 line:15%
So am I and I think

2206
01:37:11.798 --> 01:37:13.960 line:15%
you and I share interests.

2207
01:37:18.070 --> 01:37:19.320 line:15%
I understand the pressure

2208
01:37:21.670 --> 01:37:23.300 line:15%
being young and the expectation.

2209
01:37:26.250 --> 01:37:29.560 line:15%
I am not 120 years old but I feel like

2210
01:37:29.560 --> 01:37:30.860 line:15%
I understand a little bit.

2211
01:37:32.600 --> 01:37:34.980 line:15%
I have seen those far older than you that have

2212
01:37:34.980 --> 01:37:38.140 line:15%
experienced maybe half the pain I see in your eyes.

2213
01:37:38.140 --> 01:37:39.190 line:15%
Age isn't everything.

2214
01:37:40.050 --> 01:37:44.160 line:15%
Experience is what hardens you, prepares you for the worst.

2215
01:37:45.210 --> 01:37:46.260 line:15%
I think you're prepared for more than

2216
01:37:46.260 --> 01:37:48.060 line:15%
you give yourself credit for, Caleb.

2217
01:37:49.290 --> 01:37:52.280 line:15%
Well, we'll come back later and compare notes.

2218
01:37:53.490 --> 01:37:55.050 line:15%
I'll be here.

2219
01:37:55.050 --> 01:37:58.941 line:15%
Perhaps I can provide breakfast as a thank you.

2220
01:37:58.941 --> 01:37:59.774 line:15%
(clanking)

2221
01:37:59.774 --> 01:38:00.607 line:15%
Dope.

2222
01:38:02.068 --> 01:38:02.901 line:15%
(clanking)

2223
01:38:02.901 --> 01:38:04.966 line:15%
I'm just thinking about mimosas from your house, right?

2224
01:38:04.966 --> 01:38:05.799 line:15%
(laughter)

2225
01:38:05.799 --> 01:38:07.620 line:15%
Oh.
Have that green jam.

2226
01:38:07.620 --> 01:38:09.860 line:15%
Uh huh, it's really good.

2227
01:38:09.860 --> 01:38:13.040 line:15%
Well, good night.
Glad you got home safe.

2228
01:38:13.040 --> 01:38:14.790 line:15%
Thank you for the escort.
Yep.

2229
01:38:15.918 --> 01:38:17.160 line:15%
(whooshing)

2230
01:38:17.160 --> 01:38:19.669 line:15%
(laughter)

2231
01:38:19.669 --> 01:38:23.012 line:15%
And he just drifts off to, the gate opens on its own

2232
01:38:23.012 --> 01:38:24.460 line:15%
(creaking)

2233
01:38:24.460 --> 01:38:26.500 line:15%
and he heads up to the interior.

2234
01:38:26.500 --> 01:38:28.980 line:15%
How weird that that's the thing

2235
01:38:28.980 --> 01:38:31.580 line:15%
you just get stuck with, like, floating.

2236
01:38:31.580 --> 01:38:34.790 line:15%
Like people who put on an accent for

2237
01:38:34.790 --> 01:38:37.790 line:15%
half of a year and then, and then

2238
01:38:37.790 --> 01:38:39.960 line:15%
how are you going to get yourself out of it?

2239
01:38:39.960 --> 01:38:42.230 line:15%
Or a name or--
Yeah.

2240
01:38:42.230 --> 01:38:43.590 line:15%
Burning things.
Mm-hmm.

2241
01:38:44.500 --> 01:38:46.490 line:15%
Basically, like, half of our crew probably has

2242
01:38:46.490 --> 01:38:48.690 line:15%
something like that, but his is floating

2243
01:38:50.380 --> 01:38:52.683 line:15%
and he's just committed to floating.

2244
01:38:52.683 --> 01:38:54.760 line:15%
(laughter)

2245
01:38:54.760 --> 01:38:57.900 line:15%
Commit to the bit, Beauregard.

2246
01:38:57.900 --> 01:38:59.090 line:15%
But like, why?

2247
01:38:59.090 --> 01:39:01.540 line:15%
Does he feel, like, is he, he's going to have shame?

2248
01:39:02.990 --> 01:39:05.450 line:15%
Does he feel ashamed if he doesn't float?

2249
01:39:07.990 --> 01:39:09.760 line:15%
It's just so fascinating.

2250
01:39:09.760 --> 01:39:11.900 line:15%
It's one of many things that are fascinating

2251
01:39:11.900 --> 01:39:13.450 line:15%
about him, yeah.
Yeah.

2252
01:39:14.620 --> 01:39:16.600 line:15%
But at least we know there are feet under there

2253
01:39:16.600 --> 01:39:20.898 line:15%
and a full, full adult-sized body, not a tiny baby.

2254
01:39:20.898 --> 01:39:23.148 line:15%
(laughter)

2255
01:39:27.069 --> 01:39:28.151 line:15%
So stupid.

2256
01:39:28.151 --> 01:39:29.130 line:15%
(laughter)

2257
01:39:29.130 --> 01:39:31.060 line:15%
Let's go back.
All right.

2258
01:39:31.060 --> 01:39:34.670 line:15%
You guys return to the Xhorhaus, it is late in the evening.

2259
01:39:34.670 --> 01:39:38.272 line:15%
Many of you are enjoying the tale end

2260
01:39:38.272 --> 01:39:41.250 line:15%
of a wine buzz after dinner and spending time

2261
01:39:41.250 --> 01:39:42.930 line:15%
in the hot tub.
Yeah.

2262
01:39:42.930 --> 01:39:44.596 line:15%
Unless you have any other business

2263
01:39:44.596 --> 01:39:45.429 line:15%
to attend to this night--

2264
01:39:45.429 --> 01:39:47.390 line:15%
No, but seriously, what am I doing wrong, you guys?

2265
01:39:47.390 --> 01:39:48.674 line:15%
What do you mean?

2266
01:39:48.674 --> 01:39:49.507 line:15%
About what?

2267
01:39:49.507 --> 01:39:51.620 line:15%
Well, like, I feel like I do a really bad job of,

2268
01:39:51.620 --> 01:39:53.680 line:15%
you know, recruiting other people to--

2269
01:39:53.680 --> 01:39:56.410 line:15%
It's a tough sell!
Why, though?

2270
01:39:56.410 --> 01:39:58.430 line:15%
Why is it a tough sell?

2271
01:39:58.430 --> 01:40:01.130 line:15%
Well, I mean, (sighs) what does he,

2272
01:40:01.130 --> 01:40:03.640 line:15%
so, what does he do for you?

2273
01:40:04.759 --> 01:40:06.830 line:15%
He gives me really cool powers and he's a good companion

2274
01:40:06.830 --> 01:40:08.080 line:15%
and he loves me.
So, you didn't mention that.

2275
01:40:08.080 --> 01:40:10.390 line:15%
You didn't mention that to Essek.

2276
01:40:10.390 --> 01:40:12.410 line:15%
You didn't say that he gives you cool powers.

2277
01:40:12.410 --> 01:40:15.100 line:15%
You just said that he appears and he's always around

2278
01:40:15.100 --> 01:40:17.970 line:15%
and he makes you do good stuff and bad stuff.

2279
01:40:17.970 --> 01:40:19.790 line:15%
Oh.
Basically like a mom.

2280
01:40:19.790 --> 01:40:22.620 line:15%
You listed some pros and cons and in the con column,

2281
01:40:22.620 --> 01:40:26.210 line:15%
you mentioned people might get murdered and that was okay.

2282
01:40:26.210 --> 01:40:30.490 line:15%
And the pro column was maybe they have to make babies.

2283
01:40:30.490 --> 01:40:32.430 line:15%
But some people like making babies

2284
01:40:32.430 --> 01:40:34.300 line:15%
Sure, sure, who doesn't like making babies?

2285
01:40:34.300 --> 01:40:39.140 line:15%
But still, I mean, maybe next time lead with,

2286
01:40:39.140 --> 01:40:42.310 line:15%
"I have sight beyond sight now because of him."

2287
01:40:42.310 --> 01:40:43.540 line:15%
Do you?
Oh, that's good.

2288
01:40:43.540 --> 01:40:45.860 line:15%
Well, I mean, yeah, I can see, scry on people.

2289
01:40:45.860 --> 01:40:47.550 line:15%
Yeah, maybe pick, like, three bullet points--

2290
01:40:47.550 --> 01:40:49.310 line:15%
I should've, like, done the thaumaturgy thing

2291
01:40:49.310 --> 01:40:51.390 line:15%
and made something look really cool.

2292
01:40:51.390 --> 01:40:52.570 line:15%
Wait, what's in your, I don't think

2293
01:40:52.570 --> 01:40:53.830 line:15%
I've ever read your pamphlet.

2294
01:40:53.830 --> 01:40:55.290 line:15%
What do you have in your pam, what,

2295
01:40:55.290 --> 01:40:57.244 line:15%
read us the bullet points.
Oh no.

2296
01:40:57.244 --> 01:40:58.100 line:15%
(talking over each other)

2297
01:40:58.100 --> 01:40:59.919 line:15%
It's not great.
You don't want it.

2298
01:40:59.919 --> 01:41:02.420 line:15%
Yeah, we know that--
Does it talk about murdering

2299
01:41:02.420 --> 01:41:05.420 line:15%
things in the pamphlet?
No, she ad-libbed that.

2300
01:41:05.420 --> 01:41:07.900 line:15%
Most of it says stuff about how cool he is.

2301
01:41:07.900 --> 01:41:09.270 line:15%
He's really cool.
He is cool!

2302
01:41:09.270 --> 01:41:12.064 line:15%
No, I know, but that's not a very--

2303
01:41:12.064 --> 01:41:13.340 line:15%
Is there pictures of him or anything?

2304
01:41:13.340 --> 01:41:15.020 line:15%
Yeah, drawings, I made drawings.

2305
01:41:15.020 --> 01:41:17.760 line:15%
She did the drawings--
Oh wait, you made this,

2306
01:41:17.760 --> 01:41:20.220 line:15%
you made this brochure?
There's three drawings

2307
01:41:20.220 --> 01:41:21.470 line:15%
of his cloak.
I understand, okay.

2308
01:41:21.470 --> 01:41:22.740 line:15%
I mean, she's really proud of the cloak.

2309
01:41:22.740 --> 01:41:24.150 line:15%
It's a really cool cloak!
I know.

2310
01:41:24.150 --> 01:41:25.630 line:15%
I mean, I haven't seen what he

2311
01:41:25.630 --> 01:41:26.770 line:15%
looks like outside the cloak--

2312
01:41:26.770 --> 01:41:28.080 line:15%
It's like all I see is a cloak.

2313
01:41:28.080 --> 01:41:30.870 line:15%
New candidate for the Traveler, it's me.

2314
01:41:30.870 --> 01:41:32.980 line:15%
Sell me three things about the Trav--

2315
01:41:32.980 --> 01:41:35.220 line:15%
I tried to sell you on the Traveler and you went wild--

2316
01:41:35.220 --> 01:41:38.870 line:15%
I'm not Fjord, I'm not Fjord, I'm Jeff.

2317
01:41:38.870 --> 01:41:42.610 line:15%
Tell Jeff what it is about the Traveler in three points.

2318
01:41:42.610 --> 01:41:44.660 line:15%
And Jeff just had a traumatic experience.

2319
01:41:44.660 --> 01:41:48.140 line:15%
He's open, he's available.
Okay, okay, okay,

2320
01:41:48.140 --> 01:41:49.640 line:15%
okay, okay, okay.
I'm seeking

2321
01:41:49.640 --> 01:41:50.680 line:15%
change and direction.

2322
01:41:50.680 --> 01:41:52.840 line:15%
Is your real name Jeff?
Yes, it's Jeff.

2323
01:41:52.840 --> 01:41:54.530 line:15%
Okay.
J, J.

2324
01:41:54.530 --> 01:41:56.640 line:15%
Yeah, Jeff with a J.
Yes, I understand,

2325
01:41:56.640 --> 01:41:58.140 line:15%
you're feeling lost right now.

2326
01:41:59.080 --> 01:42:00.880 line:15%
You know what could really help you?

2327
01:42:02.050 --> 01:42:05.510 line:15%
The Traveler.
Who's the Traveler

2328
01:42:05.510 --> 01:42:07.400 line:15%
and what does he do?
Guidance.

2329
01:42:09.232 --> 01:42:10.065 line:15%
Well,

2330
01:42:11.170 --> 01:42:14.320 line:15%
he's a really cool guy.

2331
01:42:14.320 --> 01:42:16.600 line:15%
Okay, I like cool guys.

2332
01:42:16.600 --> 01:42:18.960 line:15%
What else, what else should I know about the Traveler?

2333
01:42:18.960 --> 01:42:20.390 line:15%
He saved my life.
He saved my life.

2334
01:42:20.390 --> 01:42:22.170 line:15%
A pearl lowers in front of Jester's forehead

2335
01:42:22.170 --> 01:42:24.980 line:15%
and little geometric shapes come out.

2336
01:42:24.980 --> 01:42:25.813 line:15%
(wheezing)

2337
01:42:25.813 --> 01:42:27.040 line:15%
More guidance.
He,

2338
01:42:28.720 --> 01:42:33.720 line:15%
he gave, he, at one time I was alone and lost in the world

2339
01:42:33.730 --> 01:42:38.730 line:15%
and the Traveler came to me and he made me feel better

2340
01:42:39.340 --> 01:42:43.010 line:15%
and he gave me some really cool powers and he made me

2341
01:42:43.010 --> 01:42:45.720 line:15%
feel special like he can make you feel special.

2342
01:42:45.720 --> 01:42:49.810 line:15%
He gave you cool powers?
Yeah, like,

2343
01:42:52.780 --> 01:42:57.780 line:15%
like I, well, spirit guardians. (snaps)

2344
01:42:58.120 --> 01:43:02.430 line:15%
And there's good fat little unicorns flying around now.

2345
01:43:02.430 --> 01:43:04.800 line:15%
Are they friendly?
Yeah, they love everyone

2346
01:43:04.800 --> 01:43:06.450 line:15%
except, unless you're, you know,

2347
01:43:06.450 --> 01:43:08.450 line:15%
going to harm me and then they'll kill you.

2348
01:43:09.741 --> 01:43:11.080 line:15%
I don't want to harm you.
I know.

2349
01:43:11.080 --> 01:43:13.590 line:15%
That's, and the Traveler doesn't want

2350
01:43:13.590 --> 01:43:15.030 line:15%
you harming you, he keeps you safe.

2351
01:43:15.030 --> 01:43:16.370 line:15%
I've heard two--
Keeps you safe.

2352
01:43:16.370 --> 01:43:18.640 line:15%
Two great things about the Traveler.

2353
01:43:18.640 --> 01:43:20.543 line:15%
If only I had one more.

2354
01:43:20.543 --> 01:43:24.620 line:15%
(wheezing)
(laughter)

2355
01:43:24.620 --> 01:43:25.453 line:15%
Um.

2356
01:43:26.453 --> 01:43:27.470 line:15%
Speak from your heart, Jester.

2357
01:43:29.280 --> 01:43:31.600 line:15%
He--

2358
01:43:32.970 --> 01:43:36.070 line:15%
What were you lacking before that he filled?

2359
01:43:36.070 --> 01:43:39.820 line:15%
Well, I was really lonely and,

2360
01:43:39.820 --> 01:43:43.170 line:15%
you know, he's a really good friend and

2361
01:43:47.927 --> 01:43:50.123 line:15%
he just accepts you for who you are

2362
01:43:51.050 --> 01:43:53.720 line:15%
and he likes all the things that are good about you

2363
01:43:53.720 --> 01:43:55.070 line:15%
and he makes them stronger.

2364
01:43:57.840 --> 01:44:00.570 line:15%
Jeff is sold.
Really?

2365
01:44:00.570 --> 01:44:01.510 line:15%
That's great.

2366
01:44:01.510 --> 01:44:04.220 line:15%
Jeff needs a friend, Jeff needs someone

2367
01:44:04.220 --> 01:44:06.830 line:15%
who takes him as he is, Jeff is down.

2368
01:44:06.830 --> 01:44:08.904 line:15%
Jeff, do you want to go to Traveler Con?

2369
01:44:08.904 --> 01:44:11.774 line:15%
We're have a con in a volcano coming up soon.

2370
01:44:11.774 --> 01:44:12.828 line:15%
What? No.

2371
01:44:12.828 --> 01:44:15.686 line:15%
(laughter)

2372
01:44:15.686 --> 01:44:18.770 line:15%
(clapping)
(laughter)

2373
01:44:18.770 --> 01:44:20.370 line:15%
Jester, that was great.

2374
01:44:20.370 --> 01:44:22.070 line:15%
Maybe leave out the volcano.

2375
01:44:22.070 --> 01:44:23.510 line:15%
But it's an important part.

2376
01:44:23.510 --> 01:44:25.987 line:15%
Tropical location.
Yeah.

2377
01:44:25.987 --> 01:44:26.920 line:15%
(laughter)

2378
01:44:26.920 --> 01:44:28.860 line:15%
Some people might be--
But that's lying--

2379
01:44:28.860 --> 01:44:29.693 line:15%
No it's not.

2380
01:44:29.693 --> 01:44:32.220 line:15%
It's a tropical location.
It is?

2381
01:44:32.220 --> 01:44:34.490 line:15%
Yeah, we don't know if it's an active or dormant volcano

2382
01:44:34.490 --> 01:44:37.730 line:15%
but when you say volcano, people go, "Active volcano."

2383
01:44:37.730 --> 01:44:39.540 line:15%
Well, some people might think that's cool

2384
01:44:39.540 --> 01:44:41.410 line:15%
because they've never seen a volcano.

2385
01:44:41.410 --> 01:44:42.243 line:15%
Right?

2386
01:44:42.243 --> 01:44:44.362 line:15%
I've never, well I have seen a volcano because we went

2387
01:44:44.362 --> 01:44:45.810 line:15%
to a volcano.
We did.

2388
01:44:45.810 --> 01:44:47.970 line:15%
Also, traveling is expensive.

2389
01:44:47.970 --> 01:44:51.830 line:15%
Maybe they're just price gated out of the experience.

2390
01:44:51.830 --> 01:44:53.810 line:15%
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Jeff has never left home

2391
01:44:53.810 --> 01:44:56.430 line:15%
and has trouble traveling over open water, so, you know.

2392
01:44:56.430 --> 01:44:59.500 line:15%
Jeff has a very imaginative back story.

2393
01:45:00.970 --> 01:45:02.779 line:15%
Jeff, where are you from?

2394
01:45:02.779 --> 01:45:04.626 line:15%
(chuckling)

2395
01:45:04.626 --> 01:45:06.359 line:15%
We don't need to know.

2396
01:45:06.359 --> 01:45:07.192 line:15%
(laughter)

2397
01:45:07.192 --> 01:45:09.008 line:15%
Pride's Call, I'm an archeology student.

2398
01:45:09.008 --> 01:45:09.992 line:15%
(laughter)

2399
01:45:09.992 --> 01:45:12.280 line:15%
Oh shit, he's responsible for the Beacon.

2400
01:45:12.280 --> 01:45:14.804 line:15%
Kill him, kill him, flay his flesh!

2401
01:45:14.804 --> 01:45:17.054 line:15%
(laughter)

2402
01:45:18.770 --> 01:45:19.830 line:15%
Jester, I think that's great.

2403
01:45:19.830 --> 01:45:20.670 line:15%
Yeah.
Okay.

2404
01:45:20.670 --> 01:45:23.660 line:15%
If Jeff were really, you'd be getting somewhere.

2405
01:45:23.660 --> 01:45:25.810 line:15%
Focus on the positive, you can't lose.

2406
01:45:25.810 --> 01:45:27.230 line:15%
Okay, okay, okay.
Maybe leave out

2407
01:45:27.230 --> 01:45:29.080 line:15%
the murdering people.
Okay.

2408
01:45:29.080 --> 01:45:30.610 line:15%
Is this what he looks like, though,

2409
01:45:30.610 --> 01:45:32.410 line:15%
and that you have in the picture?

2410
01:45:32.410 --> 01:45:33.840 line:15%
Well, yeah.

2411
01:45:33.840 --> 01:45:35.830 line:15%
Yeah, he is, like, sometimes he's big,

2412
01:45:35.830 --> 01:45:38.730 line:15%
sometimes he's little, sometimes he's,

2413
01:45:39.625 --> 01:45:43.430 line:15%
you know, just, like, the perfect size.

2414
01:45:43.430 --> 01:45:46.680 line:15%
Very, so he looks very handsome.

2415
01:45:47.580 --> 01:45:50.920 line:15%
Well, you can't really, that's how I imagine he looks

2416
01:45:50.920 --> 01:45:53.918 line:15%
because I haven't actually seen like his face's face.

2417
01:45:53.918 --> 01:45:55.420 line:15%
You just see, like--
But sometimes when he turns

2418
01:45:55.420 --> 01:45:57.300 line:15%
and, like, his cloak moves,

2419
01:45:57.300 --> 01:45:59.390 line:15%
I see, like, this, like silhouette

2420
01:45:59.390 --> 01:46:00.890 line:15%
and I can see that it's, like,

2421
01:46:02.400 --> 01:46:04.670 line:15%
really good looking.
Ooh.

2422
01:46:04.670 --> 01:46:06.800 line:15%
He's very handsome.
He's handsome.

2423
01:46:08.194 --> 01:46:10.740 line:15%
(gentle music)

2424
01:46:10.740 --> 01:46:14.420 line:15%
Caduceus, I was moved by what you said earlier

2425
01:46:14.420 --> 01:46:16.390 line:15%
about your family and your quest.

2426
01:46:18.750 --> 01:46:21.440 line:15%
I want to help you with that.
Yeah, same.

2427
01:46:21.440 --> 01:46:23.820 line:15%
I don't know if I quite understood the urgency before

2428
01:46:23.820 --> 01:46:26.800 line:15%
about your home and it dying and you need to reinstate,

2429
01:46:26.800 --> 01:46:28.060 line:15%
the needing to reinstate that--

2430
01:46:28.060 --> 01:46:29.870 line:15%
How do you grow your home again?

2431
01:46:30.880 --> 01:46:33.020 line:15%
Well--
What does that mean?

2432
01:46:33.020 --> 01:46:35.890 line:15%
I don't know entirely but I think this has something

2433
01:46:35.890 --> 01:46:36.910 line:15%
to do with it.
Whoa.

2434
01:46:36.910 --> 01:46:40.050 line:15%
And I pull out the--
The purple crystal.

2435
01:46:40.050 --> 01:46:41.280 line:15%
Crystal.
You see the,

2436
01:46:41.280 --> 01:46:44.080 line:15%
and you guys, mostly they were present

2437
01:46:44.080 --> 01:46:47.540 line:15%
for when you placed the residuum shards

2438
01:46:47.540 --> 01:46:50.190 line:15%
into the forge in the volcano.

2439
01:46:50.190 --> 01:46:53.400 line:15%
The purple crystals that grew from them

2440
01:46:53.400 --> 01:46:56.130 line:15%
and they're not solid, smooth, chiseled crystals,

2441
01:46:56.130 --> 01:46:58.200 line:15%
they're naturally grown,

2442
01:46:58.200 --> 01:47:00.140 line:15%
almost rock candy-looking purple crystals

2443
01:47:00.140 --> 01:47:02.390 line:15%
that have expanded off of the residuum glass

2444
01:47:02.390 --> 01:47:05.950 line:15%
into these larger shards that are about that long each.

2445
01:47:07.770 --> 01:47:10.380 line:15%
And he has a handful of them in his hand.

2446
01:47:10.380 --> 01:47:11.810 line:15%
Have you tried licking them?

2447
01:47:13.380 --> 01:47:16.560 line:15%
Surprisingly not, no.
Maybe you should lick it.

2448
01:47:16.560 --> 01:47:17.540 line:15%
Are you supposed to plant it?

2449
01:47:17.540 --> 01:47:21.182 line:15%
Do you want to lick it?
We could ask, okay.

2450
01:47:21.182 --> 01:47:22.112 line:15%
What do you think?

2451
01:47:22.112 --> 01:47:23.030 line:15%
It's salty.
What does it taste like?

2452
01:47:24.460 --> 01:47:25.910 line:15%
Like a rock?
Like a mineral.

2453
01:47:25.910 --> 01:47:27.750 line:15%
Like, is it salty?
Like a salty mineral.

2454
01:47:27.750 --> 01:47:30.230 line:15%
It's salty.
And what is that

2455
01:47:30.230 --> 01:47:32.800 line:15%
and what is its purpose exactly?

2456
01:47:32.800 --> 01:47:33.850 line:15%
I'm sure you've told us again,

2457
01:47:33.850 --> 01:47:35.839 line:15%
I just never listen to anything.

2458
01:47:35.839 --> 01:47:38.370 line:15%
(laughter)

2459
01:47:38.370 --> 01:47:39.480 line:15%
I don't entirely know.

2460
01:47:39.480 --> 01:47:42.510 line:15%
It came out of the forge.

2461
01:47:44.700 --> 01:47:46.220 line:15%
I think that I have to go

2462
01:47:48.010 --> 01:47:48.843 line:15%
to this,

2463
01:47:51.954 --> 01:47:53.960 line:15%
this garden, the Menagerie, and

2464
01:47:57.360 --> 01:48:01.710 line:15%
find some way of taking something

2465
01:48:01.710 --> 01:48:05.480 line:15%
from it to bring back to my garden.

2466
01:48:05.480 --> 01:48:06.630 line:15%
So is it like a seed?

2467
01:48:08.220 --> 01:48:09.820 line:15%
Hopefully.

2468
01:48:09.820 --> 01:48:12.160 line:15%
Interesting.
Do that.

2469
01:48:12.160 --> 01:48:13.760 line:15%
Yeah, let's do that on the way.

2470
01:48:13.760 --> 01:48:15.560 line:15%
Why didn't you tell us sooner?

2471
01:48:15.560 --> 01:48:17.260 line:15%
I mean--
You kind of did.

2472
01:48:17.260 --> 01:48:19.080 line:15%
I did.
You did, but you didn't,

2473
01:48:19.080 --> 01:48:20.470 line:15%
every time we brought it up, you were like,

2474
01:48:20.470 --> 01:48:21.470 line:15%
"Yeah, it can wait."

2475
01:48:23.220 --> 01:48:24.330 line:15%
Can I see?

2476
01:48:24.330 --> 01:48:26.090 line:15%
Selfless to a fault, maybe?

2477
01:48:26.090 --> 01:48:28.000 line:15%
Maybe.
Perhaps fear.

2478
01:48:28.000 --> 01:48:28.833 line:15%
Perhaps I

2479
01:48:33.280 --> 01:48:35.050 line:15%
am afraid of what I'll find.

2480
01:48:35.050 --> 01:48:39.350 line:15%
I don't know but I knew I was heading that way

2481
01:48:39.350 --> 01:48:41.050 line:15%
and I knew that I would get there,

2482
01:48:42.488 --> 01:48:46.957 line:15%
so I was letting the urgency of what had to be done

2483
01:48:49.020 --> 01:48:50.550 line:15%
be important that take precedent,

2484
01:48:50.550 --> 01:48:52.450 line:15%
I guess, and I'm glad I did.

2485
01:48:54.138 --> 01:48:55.860 line:15%
We needed to do what was done

2486
01:48:57.360 --> 01:49:00.310 line:15%
and I would've hated to have gotten in the way of that, but

2487
01:49:04.230 --> 01:49:08.360 line:15%
the next step is to go and to the next sacred site

2488
01:49:08.360 --> 01:49:11.710 line:15%
and hopefully find my family,

2489
01:49:11.710 --> 01:49:13.990 line:15%
hopefully find some or at least some sign

2490
01:49:13.990 --> 01:49:15.440 line:15%
that they have been there and

2491
01:49:17.000 --> 01:49:19.800 line:15%
find the next thing I'm supposed to do.

2492
01:49:19.800 --> 01:49:21.370 line:15%
Fuck yes.

2493
01:49:21.370 --> 01:49:22.840 line:15%
I've been in this hot tub too long

2494
01:49:22.840 --> 01:49:24.960 line:15%
and my core body temperature is rising.

2495
01:49:24.960 --> 01:49:28.170 line:15%
I'm in, let's do this.

2496
01:49:28.170 --> 01:49:30.880 line:15%
I feel real fucking dizzy.
Oh.

2497
01:49:30.880 --> 01:49:32.900 line:15%
Sit, oh no.
No, give me another drink.

2498
01:49:32.900 --> 01:49:34.340 line:15%
No, no, no.
Listen.

2499
01:49:34.340 --> 01:49:35.620 line:15%
Listen, listen, listen.

2500
01:49:35.620 --> 01:49:39.360 line:15%
Tomorrow we go, we get your armor, and then we go f--

2501
01:49:39.360 --> 01:49:41.480 line:15%
There he goes.
Oh no.

2502
01:49:41.480 --> 01:49:42.313 line:15%
Oh no.

2503
01:49:42.313 --> 01:49:45.084 line:15%
(talking over each other)

2504
01:49:45.084 --> 01:49:45.917 line:15%
(laughter)
(talking over each other)

2505
01:49:45.917 --> 01:49:48.150 line:15%
Yasha, help me get him out of the water now.

2506
01:49:48.150 --> 01:49:50.111 line:15%
So heavy even though he's so little.

2507
01:49:50.111 --> 01:49:51.450 line:15%
(laughter)

2508
01:49:51.450 --> 01:49:53.000 line:15%
He's not, he's gotten bigger.

2509
01:49:54.190 --> 01:49:55.920 line:15%
He's heavier than he used to be.

2510
01:49:55.920 --> 01:49:58.680 line:15%
Family, the Family of Stone.

2511
01:50:00.331 --> 01:50:01.540 line:15%
You shall take the limbs of this hero

2512
01:50:01.540 --> 01:50:04.980 line:15%
and walk the plains until you find an oasis,

2513
01:50:04.980 --> 01:50:07.100 line:15%
the mouth of a red and gold veined cave.

2514
01:50:07.980 --> 01:50:10.770 line:15%
There upon my altar, you shall feed these limbs

2515
01:50:10.770 --> 01:50:13.980 line:15%
to the beasts that walk there so that they may hold my mark

2516
01:50:14.960 --> 01:50:16.970 line:15%
and to this site, you shall build a menagerie

2517
01:50:16.970 --> 01:50:19.770 line:15%
whose beasts shall be my gift to the change bringer

2518
01:50:19.770 --> 01:50:21.670 line:15%
to remind her that nature is infinite.

2519
01:50:23.370 --> 01:50:25.890 line:15%
Do you get all that?
No, I,

2520
01:50:27.990 --> 01:50:28.823 line:15%
I got that.

2521
01:50:30.600 --> 01:50:33.320 line:15%
The Family of Stone?
Family of Stone.

2522
01:50:34.280 --> 01:50:37.140 line:15%
Dust, Clay, and Stone, three families.

2523
01:50:37.140 --> 01:50:38.940 line:15%
What, do you know something, what?

2524
01:50:40.800 --> 01:50:41.633 line:15%
Ah,

2525
01:50:42.600 --> 01:50:47.150 line:15%
yeah, I mean, yes, no, (scoffs) I find it ironic.

2526
01:50:47.150 --> 01:50:47.983 line:15%
What?

2527
01:50:50.480 --> 01:50:54.720 line:15%
When you're at an orphanage, they give you a,

2528
01:50:54.720 --> 01:50:56.270 line:15%
they give you a shit last name.

2529
01:50:57.970 --> 01:50:58.880 line:15%
Mine was Stone.

2530
01:51:00.315 --> 01:51:02.610 line:15%
(laughter)

2531
01:51:02.610 --> 01:51:04.863 line:15%
I never used it because it's not,

2532
01:51:04.863 --> 01:51:06.700 line:15%
it's not my name, it was just given to me--

2533
01:51:06.700 --> 01:51:08.980 line:15%
Insight check.
Make an insight check.

2534
01:51:10.716 --> 01:51:14.550 line:15%
That was terrible, 15.
It's the truth.

2535
01:51:14.550 --> 01:51:16.640 line:15%
Wow.
They gave you

2536
01:51:16.640 --> 01:51:20.660 line:15%
the name Stone?
Yes, but orphans can have

2537
01:51:21.610 --> 01:51:25.420 line:15%
any kind of bland, ordinary last name.

2538
01:51:25.420 --> 01:51:27.190 line:15%
But you got Stone.
Yes.

2539
01:51:27.190 --> 01:51:29.660 line:15%
It's very strange, I think it's totally--

2540
01:51:29.660 --> 01:51:33.190 line:15%
Family of the Wildmother.
That you now follow.

2541
01:51:34.330 --> 01:51:37.100 line:15%
What a tough name.
Wow.

2542
01:51:37.100 --> 01:51:39.086 line:15%
Fjord Stone, wow.

2543
01:51:39.086 --> 01:51:41.415 line:15%
(incoherent muttering)

2544
01:51:41.415 --> 01:51:44.064 line:15%
(groaning)

2545
01:51:44.064 --> 01:51:45.728 line:15%
I'm not a believer in coincidences.

2546
01:51:45.728 --> 01:51:46.950 line:15%
(groaning)

2547
01:51:46.950 --> 01:51:48.668 line:15%
Even when they happen--

2548
01:51:48.668 --> 01:51:49.990 line:15%
(laughter)

2549
01:51:49.990 --> 01:51:53.022 line:15%
Wee-oo wee-oo wee-oo.

2550
01:51:53.022 --> 01:51:56.807 line:15%
(grunting)
(laughter)

2551
01:51:56.807 --> 01:51:58.170 line:15%
It wouldn't be the first one in this group.

2552
01:51:58.170 --> 01:51:59.700 line:15%
No.

2553
01:51:59.700 --> 01:52:01.520 line:15%
Family of Stone, though.

2554
01:52:01.520 --> 01:52:03.180 line:15%
That's one of the three families.

2555
01:52:04.018 --> 01:52:06.100 line:15%
Wow.

2556
01:52:06.100 --> 01:52:07.550 line:15%
I've never met any of them.

2557
01:52:07.550 --> 01:52:10.064 line:15%
Now you have, you have.
Either way, either way,

2558
01:52:10.064 --> 01:52:11.600 line:15%
I'm very interested to go.

2559
01:52:11.600 --> 01:52:15.730 line:15%
I'm somehow even more interested than I was a minute ago.

2560
01:52:15.730 --> 01:52:17.540 line:15%
Maybe there'll be something else for you here

2561
01:52:17.540 --> 01:52:20.560 line:15%
and you certainly found something at the last--

2562
01:52:20.560 --> 01:52:22.530 line:15%
Oh wow.
This is exciting.

2563
01:52:23.920 --> 01:52:26.420 line:15%
I always wondered what my, who my parents were

2564
01:52:26.420 --> 01:52:27.920 line:15%
and what my real name might be.

2565
01:52:27.920 --> 01:52:30.090 line:15%
I never cared for that name, so--

2566
01:52:31.390 --> 01:52:32.780 line:15%
Well.
I just find it--

2567
01:52:35.459 --> 01:52:37.280 line:15%
I will say as part of what I do

2568
01:52:37.280 --> 01:52:39.910 line:15%
and part of what we do at the garden,

2569
01:52:42.650 --> 01:52:44.300 line:15%
names have a funny way of

2570
01:52:46.730 --> 01:52:49.730 line:15%
sneaking up on you and we definitely,

2571
01:52:49.730 --> 01:52:51.820 line:15%
the people that we put into our garden,

2572
01:52:51.820 --> 01:52:55.783 line:15%
their names are, their names have quite the effect, so.

2573
01:52:58.270 --> 01:53:01.390 line:15%
Yeah, look at that, all the way back around.

2574
01:53:03.171 --> 01:53:04.611 line:15%
(chuckling)

2575
01:53:04.611 --> 01:53:05.940 line:15%
I need ice water, I'm going to burn.

2576
01:53:05.940 --> 01:53:07.920 line:15%
Yeah, you look a little green.

2577
01:53:07.920 --> 01:53:10.460 line:15%
Like a really pale green.
That's like a minty green.

2578
01:53:10.460 --> 01:53:12.230 line:15%
It's just my pigment, thank you.

2579
01:53:12.230 --> 01:53:13.290 line:15%
No, no, no.
No, this is--

2580
01:53:13.290 --> 01:53:14.986 line:15%
Definitely lighter than--
It is a different color.

2581
01:53:14.986 --> 01:53:16.010 line:15%
(chuckling)

2582
01:53:16.010 --> 01:53:17.930 line:15%
Uh, work out in the morning, so.

2583
01:53:17.930 --> 01:53:19.040 line:15%
What?
Yep.

2584
01:53:19.040 --> 01:53:20.050 line:15%
That should've been disclosed--

2585
01:53:20.050 --> 01:53:21.531 line:15%
I'll knock on your door.
Pre-hot--

2586
01:53:21.531 --> 01:53:23.781 line:15%
(laughter)

2587
01:53:24.822 --> 01:53:25.770 line:15%
We'll go to sleep.
All right, you guys all

2588
01:53:25.770 --> 01:53:29.350 line:15%
scatter to your respective rooms in the Xhorhaus

2589
01:53:29.350 --> 01:53:31.900 line:15%
and post-dinner, post-hot tub--

2590
01:53:33.073 --> 01:53:34.402 line:15%
Oh yeah, pass out so hard.

2591
01:53:34.402 --> 01:53:37.830 line:15%
Enjoy an evening of rest in a home

2592
01:53:37.830 --> 01:53:39.780 line:15%
that you can call, ah, except for?

2593
01:53:41.653 --> 01:53:43.730 line:15%
Just a quick thing, she's wandering the halls.

2594
01:53:46.049 --> 01:53:47.790 line:15%
Hey, Jester.
Me?

2595
01:53:49.384 --> 01:53:50.369 line:15%
I thought you were looking for Nott.

2596
01:53:50.369 --> 01:53:51.202 line:15%
Sorry, I didn't mean to startle you.

2597
01:53:51.202 --> 01:53:52.324 line:15%
No--
No, it's okay,

2598
01:53:52.324 --> 01:53:53.157 line:15%
I was just thinking.
I'll leave.

2599
01:53:54.990 --> 01:53:56.330 line:15%
Good night, but,

2600
01:53:59.130 --> 01:54:01.100 line:15%
you look like you're knocking yourself a little bit

2601
01:54:01.100 --> 01:54:04.160 line:15%
and I don't think you should.

2602
01:54:05.820 --> 01:54:06.810 line:15%
Do you know what I think about

2603
01:54:06.810 --> 01:54:07.880 line:15%
the Traveler?
What?

2604
01:54:10.260 --> 01:54:12.210 line:15%
I think that he is lucky to have you.

2605
01:54:15.720 --> 01:54:17.370 line:15%
I'm the transmutation wizard, but

2606
01:54:20.950 --> 01:54:22.620 line:15%
you're the one who changes people.

2607
01:54:23.930 --> 01:54:24.780 line:15%
See it every day.

2608
01:54:26.720 --> 01:54:27.553 line:15%
Really?

2609
01:54:29.920 --> 01:54:30.753 line:15%
Yeah.

2610
01:54:33.855 --> 01:54:37.310 line:15%
You're a good friend and you move people.

2611
01:54:38.630 --> 01:54:42.050 line:15%
I don't know if you see that, but you do, every day.

2612
01:54:47.028 --> 01:54:49.445 line:15%
Thank you.
No, thank you.

2613
01:54:52.980 --> 01:54:55.910 line:15%
Can I tell you something?
Yeah.

2614
01:54:57.469 --> 01:55:00.930 line:15%
(clears throat) Earlier, we were in the park

2615
01:55:02.370 --> 01:55:04.610 line:15%
and I was trying to talk to the Traveler,

2616
01:55:04.610 --> 01:55:09.610 line:15%
I even bought him some ice cream, and he didn't come.

2617
01:55:13.390 --> 01:55:16.420 line:15%
And, to be honest, it's one of the

2618
01:55:16.420 --> 01:55:19.030 line:15%
first times that I didn't feel him

2619
01:55:21.231 --> 01:55:22.064 line:15%
near me

2620
01:55:23.815 --> 01:55:28.690 line:15%
and I wonder maybe I'm not doing a very good job of,

2621
01:55:29.755 --> 01:55:33.280 line:15%
you know, being a cleric to him or whatever.

2622
01:55:39.820 --> 01:55:43.680 line:15%
You're trying to bring more people into the fold.

2623
01:55:43.680 --> 01:55:48.350 line:15%
Well, see, that's the thing.

2624
01:55:48.350 --> 01:55:52.230 line:15%
When I set out, when I left Mama, I didn't,

2625
01:55:54.280 --> 01:55:56.880 line:15%
I didn't leave with the goal of recruiting

2626
01:55:56.880 --> 01:55:58.100 line:15%
a bunch of people to,

2627
01:55:59.720 --> 01:56:02.500 line:15%
to this religion, you know?

2628
01:56:03.822 --> 01:56:06.000 line:15%
I just, I had this good friend

2629
01:56:07.160 --> 01:56:10.920 line:15%
that saw me through my life and (sighs)

2630
01:56:14.560 --> 01:56:16.410 line:15%
I don't know what I'm supposed to do.

2631
01:56:17.900 --> 01:56:20.810 line:15%
(gentle music)

2632
01:56:20.810 --> 01:56:22.460 line:15%
Well, maybe Traveler Con will--

2633
01:56:26.100 --> 01:56:27.300 line:15%
Yeah.
Help with that.

2634
01:56:27.300 --> 01:56:28.400 line:15%
Yeah, maybe it will.

2635
01:56:32.660 --> 01:56:34.070 line:15%
I don't know anything about faith.

2636
01:56:34.070 --> 01:56:38.400 line:15%
I am learning from you and the others in the group.

2637
01:56:41.230 --> 01:56:42.260 line:15%
But it seems

2638
01:56:43.660 --> 01:56:44.493 line:15%
inexplicable.

2639
01:56:46.292 --> 01:56:47.330 line:15%
Yeah.

2640
01:56:47.330 --> 01:56:49.592 line:15%
Otherwise it wouldn't be faith.

2641
01:56:49.592 --> 01:56:50.810 line:15%
Well if you ever want to worship the Traveler,

2642
01:56:50.810 --> 01:56:54.528 line:15%
you know, you can just, he's really cool.

2643
01:56:54.528 --> 01:56:55.361 line:15%
(giggling)

2644
01:56:55.361 --> 01:56:57.730 line:15%
Well, everybody kind of made sport in there,

2645
01:56:57.730 --> 01:57:00.720 line:15%
but we are all low key acolytes of the Traveler,

2646
01:57:00.720 --> 01:57:02.120 line:15%
you realize that, don't you?

2647
01:57:03.540 --> 01:57:05.590 line:15%
Yeah?
I mean, we're with you.

2648
01:57:07.400 --> 01:57:09.550 line:15%
You see his power every day.
Every day.

2649
01:57:09.550 --> 01:57:11.030 line:15%
I believe, I have no choice.

2650
01:57:13.510 --> 01:57:16.090 line:15%
Sometimes I wonder if maybe he doesn't come around as much

2651
01:57:16.090 --> 01:57:21.090 line:15%
because he sees, you know, that I have some friends now

2652
01:57:22.590 --> 01:57:24.920 line:15%
and he doesn't need to be here as much.

2653
01:57:26.410 --> 01:57:28.010 line:15%
That seems like a good theory.

2654
01:57:28.960 --> 01:57:31.670 line:15%
Also, Traveler Con is coming, so maybe preparations

2655
01:57:31.670 --> 01:57:33.890 line:15%
are underway on a cosmic level of some sort.

2656
01:57:33.890 --> 01:57:35.190 line:15%
Yeah, yeah, that's true.

2657
01:57:36.560 --> 01:57:37.910 line:15%
You know, I think we should go to bed,

2658
01:57:37.910 --> 01:57:42.390 line:15%
but I want to show you something that I've been working on.

2659
01:57:42.390 --> 01:57:46.170 line:15%
I don't know what you have planned for Traveler Con,

2660
01:57:46.170 --> 01:57:48.870 line:15%
but if I can help in any way with something like this.

2661
01:57:51.012 --> 01:57:53.520 line:15%
And little lollipops

2662
01:57:53.520 --> 01:57:56.420 line:15%
and hamster unicorns that are amber-colored

2663
01:57:56.420 --> 01:57:59.180 line:15%
start floating around us as I cast

2664
01:58:00.930 --> 01:58:02.520 line:15%
Major Image?
Mm-hmm.

2665
01:58:02.520 --> 01:58:03.960 line:15%
In an approximation but it's

2666
01:58:03.960 --> 01:58:07.110 line:15%
a more Widogast amber flavor.

2667
01:58:09.602 --> 01:58:11.750 line:15%
I just figured this out a couple of weeks ago,

2668
01:58:11.750 --> 01:58:14.930 line:15%
so I don't know if you need effects or--

2669
01:58:14.930 --> 01:58:17.030 line:15%
Oh my gosh.
Decorations.

2670
01:58:17.881 --> 01:58:20.290 line:15%
That's a step and repeat.
I mean, it's beautiful.

2671
01:58:20.290 --> 01:58:22.030 line:15%
Lollipops are just rotating.
If I, if I did,

2672
01:58:22.030 --> 01:58:24.070 line:15%
like a performance or something, you know,

2673
01:58:24.070 --> 01:58:27.230 line:15%
like maybe if we play our musical instruments

2674
01:58:27.230 --> 01:58:29.580 line:15%
and, like, you can have this, you know, like,

2675
01:58:29.580 --> 01:58:33.550 line:15%
around us, it'll be, like, this amazing thing.

2676
01:58:35.480 --> 01:58:36.313 line:15%
Yes.

2677
01:58:38.190 --> 01:58:40.380 line:15%
I don't know, I'm not a performer.

2678
01:58:40.380 --> 01:58:42.740 line:15%
This is wonderful, Caleb.
But

2679
01:58:44.200 --> 01:58:46.920 line:15%
you have done so much for all of us

2680
01:58:48.540 --> 01:58:50.480 line:15%
that of course we should do this for you.

2681
01:58:51.900 --> 01:58:54.580 line:15%
You deserve it.
Thank you.

2682
01:58:56.010 --> 01:58:57.060 line:15%
I give him a big hug.

2683
01:59:01.150 --> 01:59:03.410 line:15%
Yeah, okay, good night.
Okay.

2684
01:59:03.410 --> 01:59:05.810 line:15%
Thank you.
I got a,

2685
01:59:05.810 --> 01:59:07.450 line:15%
I got a quick one, too.

2686
01:59:07.450 --> 01:59:09.190 line:15%
We get to that in just a second please?

2687
01:59:09.190 --> 01:59:11.630 line:15%
Yeah, go.
You guys scatter

2688
01:59:11.630 --> 01:59:14.540 line:15%
to your rooms and you go back to feeling better.

2689
01:59:15.410 --> 01:59:18.450 line:15%
You close the door and you sigh

2690
01:59:18.450 --> 01:59:20.910 line:15%
and start preparing yourself for the evenings rest

2691
01:59:20.910 --> 01:59:22.380 line:15%
and then you hear a familiar voice

2692
01:59:22.380 --> 01:59:26.330 line:15%
creep in over you shoulders: "He's not wrong, Jester."

2693
01:59:30.498 --> 01:59:32.000 line:15%
Wait, he's not wrong about, he's not wrong

2694
01:59:32.000 --> 01:59:34.050 line:15%
about you are doing big preparations?

2695
01:59:35.270 --> 01:59:38.490 line:15%
Well, there's a big event coming up, of course.

2696
01:59:38.490 --> 01:59:42.000 line:15%
But not wrong coming about you changing those around you.

2697
01:59:46.280 --> 01:59:49.731 line:15%
Even if I'm not there in person, I'm always there.

2698
01:59:49.731 --> 01:59:51.350 line:15%
And you see the face come over your shoulder

2699
01:59:51.350 --> 01:59:52.800 line:15%
and a familiar hood lean forward,

2700
01:59:52.800 --> 01:59:56.280 line:15%
the smile across the lips and the arm touch your shoulder.

2701
02:00:00.210 --> 02:00:04.538 line:15%
"I know faith can be challenging, but

2702
02:00:05.700 --> 02:00:10.360 line:15%
"you were my first and you'll always be my favorite.

2703
02:00:10.360 --> 02:00:12.610 line:15%
LAURA: (laughs)

2704
02:00:13.820 --> 02:00:15.590 line:15%
Do you want me to do a big performance?

2705
02:00:15.590 --> 02:00:18.009 line:15%
Do you want me to do something special at Traveler Con?

2706
02:00:18.009 --> 02:00:19.670 line:15%
I realize I haven't asked you any questions, I mean,

2707
02:00:19.670 --> 02:00:23.210 line:15%
you ask questions about what you want me to do.

2708
02:00:23.210 --> 02:00:24.660 line:15%
Should I get cloaks together?

2709
02:00:27.180 --> 02:00:30.900 line:15%
MATT: "Sure."
LAURA: Oh, okay, okay.

2710
02:00:30.900 --> 02:00:31.990 line:15%
MATT: "I trust your ideas.

2711
02:00:32.880 --> 02:00:34.980 line:15%
"I trust your inspirations.

2712
02:00:38.460 --> 02:00:42.140 line:15%
LAURA: We're going to make it so special.

2713
02:00:42.140 --> 02:00:47.140 line:15%
MATT: "That we shall."
LAURA: (giggles) I can't wait.

2714
02:00:47.530 --> 02:00:48.920 line:15%
MATT: Caduceus.

2715
02:00:48.920 --> 02:00:51.614 line:15%
(laughter)

2716
02:00:51.614 --> 02:00:54.248 line:15%
TALIESIN: Taking a second, thank you.

2717
02:00:54.248 --> 02:00:58.648 line:15%
I'm going to quickly just crawl over
to Yasha's room as she's--

2718
02:00:58.648 --> 02:01:00.678 line:15%
MATT: Okay.
TALIEISN: -- passing out.

2719
02:01:01.590 --> 02:01:03.430 line:15%
So--
Hello.

2720
02:01:03.430 --> 02:01:05.360 line:15%
Hi, I just wanted to put this

2721
02:01:05.360 --> 02:01:07.790 line:15%
in your head before we go any further.

2722
02:01:11.790 --> 02:01:16.170 line:15%
Nobody's really talked about what happened

2723
02:01:16.170 --> 02:01:18.110 line:15%
during the fight and I'm,

2724
02:01:21.910 --> 02:01:24.600 line:15%
some of the others, and I think you'll agree, are,

2725
02:01:27.850 --> 02:01:29.400 line:15%
well, this is a group of loners

2726
02:01:30.459 --> 02:01:33.890 line:15%
and I'm very used to other people's grief and sadness.

2727
02:01:33.890 --> 02:01:35.010 line:15%
I've been around it my whole life

2728
02:01:35.010 --> 02:01:38.040 line:15%
and I've seen every way someone can react

2729
02:01:38.040 --> 02:01:39.740 line:15%
to the worst things in their life.

2730
02:01:40.880 --> 02:01:41.713 line:15%
Yeah.
And--

2731
02:01:46.700 --> 02:01:50.460 line:15%
I understand that that was maybe not the best way to

2732
02:01:55.440 --> 02:01:56.670 line:15%
deal with it, but--

2733
02:01:56.670 --> 02:02:01.350 line:15%
Oh, I'm not here to, to speak down to your process.

2734
02:02:02.520 --> 02:02:05.520 line:15%
I'm not here to tell you how to feel what you're going to feel.

2735
02:02:10.580 --> 02:02:12.380 line:15%
Just make sure

2736
02:02:13.280 --> 02:02:16.970 line:15%
that for whatever grief and rage

2737
02:02:16.970 --> 02:02:19.770 line:15%
and anger that you're going to process,

2738
02:02:19.770 --> 02:02:24.210 line:15%
that you just put 10, 20% of it

2739
02:02:24.210 --> 02:02:26.110 line:15%
on someone else and not just yourself.

2740
02:02:27.526 --> 02:02:29.610 line:15%
You don't have to do too much but you have to

2741
02:02:29.610 --> 02:02:31.520 line:15%
do a little bit with other people.

2742
02:02:32.810 --> 02:02:33.910 line:15%
You can't do it alone.

2743
02:02:36.910 --> 02:02:37.743 line:15%
Thank you.

2744
02:02:39.620 --> 02:02:41.210 line:15%
I don't quite know how to do that yet,

2745
02:02:41.210 --> 02:02:45.220 line:15%
but maybe I will learn.
Storm Lord's good for that

2746
02:02:45.220 --> 02:02:49.040 line:15%
and you have a good group of friends and

2747
02:02:52.810 --> 02:02:57.810 line:15%
they made a promise to save you from the thing that took you

2748
02:02:58.470 --> 02:02:59.890 line:15%
and I'm sure that they're still looking forward

2749
02:02:59.890 --> 02:03:01.240 line:15%
to fulfilling that promise.

2750
02:03:03.800 --> 02:03:04.633 line:15%
Yeah.

2751
02:03:05.950 --> 02:03:06.783 line:15%
I,

2752
02:03:09.110 --> 02:03:12.620 line:15%
(inhales) this is going to sound very strange, but

2753
02:03:15.360 --> 02:03:16.193 line:15%
ugh, I'm,

2754
02:03:18.567 --> 02:03:21.440 line:15%
(exhaling)

2755
02:03:21.440 --> 02:03:24.520 line:15%
can I sleep in your room?

2756
02:03:26.460 --> 02:03:28.770 line:15%
I, not in a weird way, I just seem to--

2757
02:03:30.380 --> 02:03:34.690 line:15%
I shared a single room with a lot of family, yes.

2758
02:03:34.690 --> 02:03:37.970 line:15%
I may snore, they claim I snore, I don't think it's true.

2759
02:03:37.970 --> 02:03:40.850 line:15%
I don't care, I've heard crazy things--

2760
02:03:40.850 --> 02:03:42.550 line:15%
Come on.
When I sleep, but I,

2761
02:03:45.300 --> 02:03:46.133 line:15%
I think I'm just

2762
02:03:48.650 --> 02:03:50.320 line:15%
scared to sleep alone.

2763
02:03:52.993 --> 02:03:54.920 line:15%
Sure, any time.
Okay.

2764
02:03:56.411 --> 02:03:58.994 line:15%
(gentle music)

2765
02:04:00.040 --> 02:04:02.650 line:15%
I'm very excited to help you.

2766
02:04:05.250 --> 02:04:06.800 line:15%
I'm excited to help you, too.

2767
02:04:10.774 --> 02:04:11.650 line:15%
Okay.
I really don't snore.

2768
02:04:11.650 --> 02:04:13.148 line:15%
I don't know why they say it.

2769
02:04:13.148 --> 02:04:15.398 line:15%
(laughter)

2770
02:04:16.435 --> 02:04:17.268 line:15%
Well, I do.

2771
02:04:17.268 --> 02:04:19.518 line:15%
(laughter)

2772
02:04:21.841 --> 02:04:25.700 line:15%
All right, as you all--
Can I read a little before?

2773
02:04:25.700 --> 02:04:29.070 line:15%
I have four hours left.
It's about,

2774
02:04:30.520 --> 02:04:33.000 line:15%
I'd say at this point, because you guys didn't,

2775
02:04:33.000 --> 02:04:34.040 line:15%
I'd say about 11.

2776
02:04:34.040 --> 02:04:34.920 line:15%
It's not too terribly late.

2777
02:04:34.920 --> 02:04:36.850 line:15%
You could read until three and finish it if you want.

2778
02:04:36.850 --> 02:04:38.340 line:15%
Yeah, let's do it.
Okay.

2779
02:04:40.258 --> 02:04:41.091 line:15%
Yes.
Staying up late.

2780
02:04:41.091 --> 02:04:44.110 line:15%
Do-do-do-doo.
Yes, Snore-phan Maker.

2781
02:04:44.110 --> 02:04:45.340 line:15%
(laughter)

2782
02:04:45.340 --> 02:04:47.530 line:15%
Snore-phan Maker. (laughs)

2783
02:04:47.530 --> 02:04:49.130 line:15%
(snoring)

2784
02:04:49.130 --> 02:04:53.950 line:15%
Caduceus does snore.
100%.

2785
02:04:53.950 --> 02:04:57.420 line:15%
But you were engrossed, whether by

2786
02:04:57.420 --> 02:04:59.420 line:15%
the dynamic of the writing of this book,

2787
02:05:00.594 --> 02:05:05.360 line:15%
the unrecognized enchantment that draws you in

2788
02:05:05.360 --> 02:05:08.240 line:15%
and takes hold and has progressively

2789
02:05:08.240 --> 02:05:11.770 line:15%
been imprinting upon you, the magic it holds,

2790
02:05:11.770 --> 02:05:16.050 line:15%
and the occasionally delightful extremely graphic

2791
02:05:16.050 --> 02:05:17.620 line:15%
short stories that are interspersed

2792
02:05:17.620 --> 02:05:19.320 line:15%
throughout some of the back pages,

2793
02:05:21.240 --> 02:05:22.350 line:15%
you complete your reading of the book

2794
02:05:22.350 --> 02:05:24.888 line:15%
and as you close the final--
The butter churner.

2795
02:05:24.888 --> 02:05:27.138 line:15%
(laughter)

2796
02:05:29.920 --> 02:05:31.806 line:15%
As you close the final bit--

2797
02:05:31.806 --> 02:05:32.639 line:15%
Well, that was a first choice.

2798
02:05:32.639 --> 02:05:34.097 line:15%
(laughter)

2799
02:05:34.097 --> 02:05:34.930 line:15%
Yep.
So good.

2800
02:05:34.930 --> 02:05:36.700 line:15%
As you close the back of the book,

2801
02:05:36.700 --> 02:05:39.230 line:15%
an overwhelming exhaustion hits you and immediately,

2802
02:05:39.230 --> 02:05:43.190 line:15%
your eyes dip, dip, and you fall asleep

2803
02:05:43.190 --> 02:05:45.060 line:15%
holding the book to your chest,

2804
02:05:45.060 --> 02:05:46.860 line:15%
back still against the wall.

2805
02:05:47.996 --> 02:05:49.120 line:15%
And that's where we're going to take our break.

2806
02:05:49.120 --> 02:05:50.730 line:15%
(cheering)

2807
02:05:50.730 --> 02:05:53.280 line:15%
All righty, we'll be back here in a few minutes

2808
02:05:53.280 --> 02:05:55.800 line:15%
after a very role play heavy first half.

2809
02:05:55.800 --> 02:05:58.030 line:15%
Yeah.
Good pool, though, there.

2810
02:05:58.030 --> 02:05:59.964 line:15%
It was awesome.
Stone?

2811
02:05:59.964 --> 02:06:01.200 line:15%
We have our world giveaway tonight is

2812

and then the rest of tonight's session. (clicks tongue)

2822
02:06:21.840 --> 02:06:24.310
There's got to be, right?
Yes.

2823
02:06:24.310 --> 02:06:27.240
In the world of Critical Role's Exandria,

2824
02:06:27.240 --> 02:06:29.110
a fresh conflict threatens to tear

2825
02:06:29.110 --> 02:06:31.560
the continent of Wildemount apart

2826
02:06:31.560 --> 02:06:36.020
as the Dwendalian Empire and Kryn Dynasty prepare for war.

2827
02:06:36.020 --> 02:06:38.600
Hidden in this vast landscape are secrets that could

2828
02:06:38.600 --> 02:06:42.030
end the conflict and usher in a new age of peace

2829
02:06:42.030 --> 02:06:44.660
or burn the world to a cinder.

2830
02:06:44.660 --> 02:06:47.060
In the Explorer's Guide to Wildemount,

2831

spells, and magic items, including the

2839
02:07:06.580 --> 02:07:08.780
reality-bending magic of dunamancy

2847
02:07:24.580 --> 02:07:27.010
Last time, on Talks Machina.

2848
02:07:27.010 --> 02:07:28.360
Have you been on since you've been back?

2849
02:07:28.360 --> 02:07:30.560
Yeah, once, right?
I have.

2850
02:07:30.560 --> 02:07:32.650
Once, with Matt, so.
Oh, really?

2851
02:07:32.650 --> 02:07:33.483
No way.
Yeah.

2852
02:07:33.483 --> 02:07:35.330
It was with Matt.
Is this just our routine?

2853
02:07:35.330 --> 02:07:37.050
I think so.
All right.

2854
02:07:37.050 --> 02:07:39.500
Not a baseball card variant, but--

2855
02:07:39.500 --> 02:07:40.620
That's awesome.
So good.

2856
02:07:40.620 --> 02:07:42.540
That works out.
It works, it works.

2857
02:07:42.540 --> 02:07:45.600
Don't touch him again.
I can't make any promises.

2858
02:07:45.600 --> 02:07:47.660
No, literally it's like an insurance thing.

2859
02:07:47.660 --> 02:07:48.837
Trav is still--

2860
02:07:48.837 --> 02:07:49.670
(laughter)

2861
02:07:49.670 --> 02:07:50.690
Matt anymore.
It's going to happen.

2862
02:07:50.690 --> 02:07:52.061
Oh.

2863
02:07:52.061 --> 02:07:52.894
(dramatic music)

2864
02:07:52.894 --> 02:07:56.200
It's very close.
Ooh. (makes alarm noise)

2865
02:07:56.200 --> 02:07:58.030
Going to put just a little boop.

2866
02:07:58.030 --> 02:07:58.950
I got a knee boop.

2867
02:07:58.950 --> 02:08:02.080 line:15%
In the fight with Kal, was it Yasha's intention

2868
02:08:02.080 --> 02:08:04.500 line:15%
to prove to herself that she could be

2869
02:08:04.500 --> 02:08:06.970 line:15%
in control of the situation and herself,

2870
02:08:06.970 --> 02:08:09.610 line:15%
to do penance, or something else?

2871
02:08:09.610 --> 02:08:14.610 line:15%
Did you/Yasha know she was going to throw the fight

2872
02:08:15.320 --> 02:08:17.910 line:15%
when she agreed to come to the fight club?

2873
02:08:17.910 --> 02:08:19.780
It wasn't until we met with

2874
02:08:23.498 --> 02:08:27.900
the person in the, behind the, the, the butcher's--

2875
02:08:27.900 --> 02:08:29.630
Right, right, the person who's running the actual event.

2876
02:08:29.630 --> 02:08:31.610 line:15%
Yeah, what was their name?
Jacquel, I think.

2877
02:08:31.610 --> 02:08:32.550 line:15%
Jacquel.
Yeah.

2878
02:08:32.550 --> 02:08:34.210 line:15%
Okay, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Jacquel.

2879
02:08:35.240 --> 02:08:37.930
When she was sort of talking about

2880
02:08:39.390 --> 02:08:43.840
fighting one of the champions and I think that just

2881
02:08:45.400 --> 02:08:49.310
that word specifically triggered something for Yasha

2882
02:08:49.310 --> 02:08:52.910
because of, you know, being a champion for--

2883
02:08:52.910 --> 02:08:54.210
Yup.
So I,

2884
02:08:56.540 --> 02:08:59.840
at that point, was like, "Oh, you know what?

2885
02:09:02.160 --> 02:09:04.389
"I think I'm going to throw the fight.

2886
02:09:04.389 --> 02:09:07.430
"I think I'm going to go in, and I think for Yasha, this is a,

2887
02:09:08.860 --> 02:09:12.280
"this felt like something that she would need

2888
02:09:12.280 --> 02:09:16.500
"and I feel like she's still beating herself up and is,

2889
02:09:17.340 --> 02:09:20.970
"thinks she deserves that punishment for what she did."

2890
02:09:21.870 --> 02:09:24.350
I, and I think I've even talked about this before

2891
02:09:24.350 --> 02:09:26.020
where I think it's so important

2892
02:09:26.020 --> 02:09:28.320
to give your characters obstacles

2893
02:09:28.320 --> 02:09:30.750
because it's more interesting to give them something

2894
02:09:30.750 --> 02:09:32.400
that they can overcome.
Right.

2895
02:09:32.400 --> 02:09:36.130
And so, I'm, I'm very excited to see where she,

2896
02:09:36.130 --> 02:09:38.099
how she can pull herself out of this.

2897
02:09:38.099 --> 02:09:39.900 line:15%
Yasha has been powering through

2898
02:09:39.900 --> 02:09:41.970 line:15%
that tome for several days in a row.

2899
02:09:41.970 --> 02:09:43.800 line:15%
Does she enjoy reading?

2900
02:09:43.800 --> 02:09:45.780 line:15%
If so, what kinds of books does she like?

2901
02:09:45.780 --> 02:09:50.118 line:15%
Fitness-related ones like the tome or smut like the tome?

2902
02:09:50.118 --> 02:09:52.434 line:15%
(laughter)

2903
02:09:52.434 --> 02:09:54.930 line:15%
Yeah, I think she, she really likes

2904
02:09:54.930 --> 02:09:56.930
activities where she

2905
02:09:59.870 --> 02:10:00.703
gets to be alone.

2906
02:10:00.703 --> 02:10:03.530
I think sort of reading a fitness book isn't necessarily

2907
02:10:03.530 --> 02:10:05.340
the first thing that she would go to.

2908
02:10:05.340 --> 02:10:07.740
Mm-hmm.
But

2909
02:10:07.740 --> 02:10:08.573
I think

2910
02:10:10.150 --> 02:10:12.430
because Fjord gave it to her,

2911
02:10:15.060 --> 02:10:16.960
it's another, it was another gift

2912
02:10:16.960 --> 02:10:19.900
and she takes that very seriously.

2913
02:10:19.900 --> 02:10:22.730 line:15%
We knew with this being the first game back from break,

2914
02:10:22.730 --> 02:10:25.440 line:15%
there would be a little finding the groove for the players.

2915
02:10:25.440 --> 02:10:27.610 line:15%
How do you balance letting them get their wiggles out

2916
02:10:27.610 --> 02:10:29.773 line:15%
with pushing the story forward?

2917
02:10:29.773 --> 02:10:32.351 line:15%
(laughs) Apparently by hiding behind my palms.

2918
02:10:32.351 --> 02:10:33.184 line:15%
(laughter)

2919
02:10:33.184 --> 02:10:35.190 line:15%
Plenty of times, right?

2920
02:10:35.190 --> 02:10:36.890
If you can sense the players are having fun,

2921
02:10:36.890 --> 02:10:39.530
you let them have fun and it's funny in the right moments

2922
02:10:39.530 --> 02:10:42.460
to throw some, some wrenches in that

2923
02:10:42.460 --> 02:10:45.770
or throw a nod to a direction that somethings happening.

2924
02:10:46.960 --> 02:10:49.190
So, it's just something you feel with your group.

2925
02:10:49.190 --> 02:10:50.310
You learn it over time and, like,

2926
02:10:50.310 --> 02:10:52.040
since I've known these guys for so long,

2927
02:10:52.040 --> 02:10:53.590
I know when they're having fun and they're on a roll

2928
02:10:53.590 --> 02:10:55.190
and they're really enjoying the moment

2929
02:10:55.190 --> 02:10:56.660
and then I don't want to be like,

2930
02:10:56.660 --> 02:10:58.140
"All right guys, back to the narrative,"

2931
02:10:58.140 --> 02:10:59.850
if everyone's on the same page

2932
02:10:59.850 --> 02:11:00.860
and it's not going too long.

2933
02:11:00.860 --> 02:11:03.540
It would be really funny, though, if Matt out of nowhere

2934
02:11:03.540 --> 02:11:06.406
was like, "Hey, stop."
Stop it.

2935
02:11:06.406 --> 02:11:07.350
(claps) Eyes forward!

2936
02:11:07.350 --> 02:11:09.340
I did not, I was not up til 2 a.m.

2937
02:11:09.340 --> 02:11:11.830
typing these four pages--
Yeah.

2938
02:11:11.830 --> 02:11:14.560
For this farmer to tell you, you know.

2939
02:11:14.560 --> 02:11:17.130
I demand respect at this table!

2940
02:11:18.428 --> 02:11:20.023
God!
I would die, I would die.

2941
02:11:20.023 --> 02:11:20.856
Oh, I'm scared.

2942
02:11:20.856 --> 02:11:21.689
We would all start laughing.

2943
02:11:21.689 --> 02:11:22.522
Yeah, you would.
I would die.

2944
02:11:22.522 --> 02:11:24.273
We'd be like--
I'd be like.

2945
02:11:24.273 --> 02:11:26.080
Ha ha ha ha. (laughs)

2946
02:11:26.080 --> 02:11:27.710
Then I just got up and left for, like, 20 minutes.

2947
02:11:27.710 --> 02:11:28.750
Yeah, and we'd be like, "Oh shit,

2948
02:11:28.750 --> 02:11:30.130
"we really did--"
Oh yeah, the pouty, like--

2949
02:11:30.130 --> 02:11:30.963
Yeah.
The pouty

2950
02:11:30.963 --> 02:11:31.940
leave of the table.
And then it

2951
02:11:31.940 --> 02:11:34.438
gets really awkward, then I come back and just, I,

2952
02:11:34.438 --> 02:11:35.700
(dramatic music)

2953
02:11:35.700 --> 02:11:37.502
I'm really sorry about that, guys.

2954
02:11:37.502 --> 02:11:39.691
(laughter)

2955
02:11:39.691 --> 02:11:41.020
Just Joaquin Phoenix it.

2956
02:11:41.020 --> 02:11:41.853
Yeah.
Yeah,

2957
02:11:41.853 --> 02:11:42.720
straight up, straight up.

2958
02:11:42.720 --> 02:11:46.550 line:15%
Did Yasha know Molly's cards were incomplete?

2959
02:11:46.550 --> 02:11:49.560 line:15%
What would she think of Jester continuing the cards?

2960
02:11:49.560 --> 02:11:51.850
I don't think Yasha would be upset

2961
02:11:51.850 --> 02:11:54.250
that Jester would sort of complete--

2962
02:11:54.250 --> 02:11:56.650
Continue the cards, yeah.
The deck because

2963
02:11:58.370 --> 02:12:01.291
I think Jester is one of those characters that

2964
02:12:01.291 --> 02:12:04.440
you, she wears her heart on her sleeve

2965
02:12:04.440 --> 02:12:06.880
and you, you, you know her heart.

2966
02:12:06.880 --> 02:12:09.980
She's sentimental.
Yeah, so I think,

2967
02:12:09.980 --> 02:12:11.410
I think if--
It's that way.

2968
02:12:11.410 --> 02:12:15.960
If that deck went to anybody who would use them,

2969
02:12:17.060 --> 02:12:19.579
it couldn't have, it just couldn't have

2970
02:12:19.579 --> 02:12:21.990
gone to, in better hands.
Yeah,

2971
02:12:21.990 --> 02:12:23.840
there couldn't have been a more chaotic person--

2972
02:12:23.840 --> 02:12:24.990
Yeah.
For Molly to have been

2973
02:12:24.990 --> 02:12:28.070
happy to see them go to.
Yes, yeah.

2974
02:12:28.070 --> 02:12:30.740
I think, I think Yasha knows that Molly

2975
02:12:30.740 --> 02:12:33.220
would be so happy.
Yeah.

2976
02:12:33.220 --> 02:12:35.120
I also am convinced that Jester is

2977
02:12:35.120 --> 02:12:37.030
the evil big bad so she's going to use--

2978
02:12:37.030 --> 02:12:38.120
I hope so.
Use the cards

2979
02:12:38.120 --> 02:12:40.700
in some sort of magical way to kill all of you.

2980
02:12:40.700 --> 02:12:42.520
No comment.
I just can't,

2981
02:12:42.520 --> 02:12:45.060
I can't wait to see how Laura uses them

2982
02:12:45.060 --> 02:12:46.940
because I know it's going to be amazing.

2983
02:12:46.940 --> 02:12:48.710
Yeah, she doesn't, she doesn't forget about stuff.

2984
02:12:48.710 --> 02:12:51.690
No.
Jester has been such a,

2985
02:12:51.690 --> 02:12:56.140
an unknown, like, pressure valve for Laura's id

2986
02:12:57.220 --> 02:12:58.900
that I don't think any of us could've expected.

2987
02:12:58.900 --> 02:13:00.390
What a great way to put it.
Like, it's a whole,

2988
02:13:00.390 --> 02:13:02.270
it's a whole aspect of her that,

2989
02:13:02.270 --> 02:13:03.800
she didn't create Jester outta thin air.

2990
02:13:03.800 --> 02:13:05.000
Jester was a part of her that's been,

2991
02:13:05.000 --> 02:13:07.320
like, dying to be released--
Yeah.

2992
02:13:07.320 --> 02:13:08.670
For so long and we're all just, like,

2993
02:13:08.670 --> 02:13:11.000
learning so much about Laura through this campaign.

2994
02:13:11.000 --> 02:13:14.930
I'm like, "Oh man, we got to hang out more."

2995
02:13:14.930 --> 02:13:16.570
Yeah, definitely, yeah.

2996
02:13:16.570 --> 02:13:18.420
And that's the first question he's answered

2997
02:13:18.420 --> 02:13:21.340
without touching the, uh, is that

2998
02:13:21.340 --> 02:13:23.450
the eyes on the octopus there?

2999
02:13:23.450 --> 02:13:25.255
Oh, I'm touching it.
Yeah.

3000
02:13:25.255 --> 02:13:26.621
(laughs) Oh.

3001
02:13:26.621 --> 02:13:28.871
(laughter)

3002
02:13:30.158 --> 02:13:32.820
And that question just got a lot deeper.

3003
02:13:32.820 --> 02:13:35.820
Make no mistake, my friend, I am touching it.

3004
02:13:37.030 --> 02:13:38.070
Subscribe

3005
02:13:39.830 --> 02:13:41.280
or don't subscribe.

3006
02:13:44.200 --> 02:13:45.330
That's not a question.

3007
02:13:47.930 --> 02:13:51.220
Whether 'tis nobler in the mind to ponder the pros

3008
02:13:51.220 --> 02:13:54.330
and more pros of Twitch or Twitch Prime

3009
02:13:55.900 --> 02:13:58.500
or to take hands and gift new subs

3010
02:13:58.500 --> 02:14:00.780
to Critters who find they can't afford them.

3011
02:14:02.870 --> 02:14:03.703
To play,

3012
02:14:06.730 --> 02:14:07.563
to sleep

3013
02:14:09.560 --> 02:14:10.393
no more.

3014
02:14:12.280 --> 02:14:15.710
And by, a sleep to say the cast and crew of Crit'cal Role

3015
02:14:15.710 --> 02:14:17.130
might find their naps around

3016
02:14:17.130 --> 02:14:20.140
the hectic schedule of a live broadcast

3017
02:14:20.140 --> 02:14:22.620
that we have brought for your consumption,

3018
02:14:22.620 --> 02:14:24.770
both Critter and fan alike.

3019
02:14:27.880 --> 02:14:28.713
To play

3020
02:14:30.100 --> 02:14:30.933
or sleep.

3021
02:14:34.330 --> 02:14:35.163
No sleep,

3022
02:14:36.350 --> 02:14:37.810
but just to stream.

3023
02:14:39.930 --> 02:14:41.160
Aye, there's the rub.

3024
02:14:42.700 --> 02:14:47.090
For with your subscription, what streams may come.

3025
02:14:51.678 --> 02:14:54.040
Oh man, oh man, oh man, that is a fucking tag line.

3026
02:14:54.040 --> 02:14:54.873
Do we got that?

3027
02:14:55.893 --> 02:14:56.810
Oh.

3028
02:14:56.810 --> 02:14:57.950
That is Twitch poetry.

3029
02:14:59.871 --> 02:15:04.871
(groans) Oh, anyway, subscribe to Critical Role.

3030
02:15:04.940 --> 02:15:07.020
Use Twitch Prime to subscribe,

3031
02:15:07.020 --> 02:15:10.050
gift some subscriptions, you, you got it.

3032
02:15:11.687 --> 02:15:14.021
(inhaling)

3033
02:15:14.021 --> 02:15:16.303
Well, wrong slogan for the skull but, uh,

3034
02:15:17.876 --> 02:15:19.413
that's fucking good.

3035
02:15:19.413 --> 02:15:22.246
(classical music)

3036
02:15:25.323 --> 02:15:28.073
(dramatic music)

3037
02:27:15.450 --> 02:27:16.283
Hello everyone, welcome back.

3038
02:27:16.283 --> 02:27:18.170
So--
Got an ends.

3039
02:27:18.170 --> 02:27:19.003
You did.

3040
02:27:19.003 --> 02:27:20.350
Before we get back, we have the

3041
02:27:20.350 --> 02:27:21.510

Yasha, as you wake up in the morning,

3062
02:28:08.740 --> 02:28:12.280 line:15%
your whole body is sore like you'd come out of

3063
02:28:12.280 --> 02:28:14.380 line:15%
an extended battle for a period of time.

3064
02:28:14.380 --> 02:28:17.010 line:15%
And it's strange and you're like, "Ah.

3065
02:28:17.010 --> 02:28:18.580 line:15%
Spider Man.
Yeah, in a very, very

3066
02:28:18.580 --> 02:28:21.290 line:15%
minor Spider Man-like transformation, like,

3067
02:28:21.290 --> 02:28:24.810 line:15%
you're slightly more swole than you previously were.

3068
02:28:25.722 --> 02:28:28.290 line:15%
So your strength goes up by two.

3069
02:28:28.290 --> 02:28:30.650 line:15%
Two!
Oh ho ho ho

3070
02:28:30.650 --> 02:28:31.483 line:15%
shit.
Two?

3071
02:28:32.871 --> 02:28:34.489 line:15%
What does that take you to?

3072
02:28:34.489 --> 02:28:35.669 line:15%
(imitated crashing noises)

3073
02:28:35.669 --> 02:28:37.148 line:15%
Uh huh.
Does that take you to 20?

3074
02:28:37.148 --> 02:28:37.981 line:15%
Delts.
No.

3075
02:28:37.981 --> 02:28:38.814 line:15%
Traps.

02:28:38.814 --> 02:28:41.170 line:15%
Triceps, biceps.
Go to--

3077
02:28:41.170 --> 02:28:43.380 line:15%
Lats, quads--
Where you at in strength?

3078
02:28:43.380 --> 02:28:45.795 line:15%
Where's that strength at?
Let's see, let's see,

3079
02:28:45.795 --> 02:28:46.839 line:15%
let's see.
Glutes.

3080
02:28:46.839 --> 02:28:47.700 line:15%
In the 19.
Hamstrings.

3081
02:28:48.578 --> 02:28:49.740 line:15%
It's 19, yeah.

3082
02:28:49.740 --> 02:28:52.820 line:15%
Rhomboids.
Coccyx.

3083
02:28:53.774 --> 02:28:56.024 line:15%
(laughter)

3084
02:28:57.550 --> 02:28:59.684 line:15%
Sphincter. (laughs)

3085
02:28:59.684 --> 02:29:00.517 line:15%
Go to your ability scores is

3086
02:29:00.517 --> 02:29:01.776 line:15%
where you would find all of that.

3087
02:29:01.776 --> 02:29:03.306 line:15%
Yeah, it's not letting us in, though.

3088
02:29:03.306 --> 02:29:04.139 line:15%
You know what?

3089
02:29:04.139 --> 02:29:05.911 line:15%
Maybe if I go to, hid my DM.
Okay.

3090
02:29:05.911 --> 02:29:10.350 line:15%
Yo, my sphincter's swole. (laughs)

3091
02:29:10.350 --> 02:29:12.175 line:15%
(chair creaking)

3092
02:29:12.175 --> 02:29:13.008 line:15%
Sorry.

3093
02:29:13.008 --> 02:29:14.099 line:15%
So.

3094
02:29:14.099 --> 02:29:15.270 line:15%
(laughter)

3095
02:29:15.270 --> 02:29:16.570 line:15%
Shit, over the break, we should've

3096
02:29:16.570 --> 02:29:17.710 line:15%
talked about what we were going to do.

3097
02:29:17.710 --> 02:29:18.670 line:15%
Yeah, what are you guys going to do?

3098
02:29:18.670 --> 02:29:20.480 line:15%
Shit.
Hey Sam, whatcha going to do?

3099
02:29:20.480 --> 02:29:21.800 line:15%
Uh, we made a to do list.

3100
02:29:21.800 --> 02:29:23.360 line:15%
Yasha's going to get that armor.

3101
02:29:23.360 --> 02:29:24.490 line:15%
Yeah, let's go there first.

3102
02:29:24.490 --> 02:29:26.900 line:15%
Well, is it going to fit her anymore?

3103
02:29:26.900 --> 02:29:28.770 line:15%
Yeah, of course, it was bracers.

3104
02:29:28.770 --> 02:29:30.290 line:15%
Oh.
They can expand.

3105
02:29:31.130 --> 02:29:33.650 line:15%
But have you seen her wrists now?

3106
02:29:33.650 --> 02:29:35.054 line:15%
I don't know, have you?
Do you arrive back

3107
02:29:35.054 --> 02:29:36.114 line:15%
at the house, like--
Popeye.

3108
02:29:36.114 --> 02:29:37.338 line:15%
Do you arrive back at the house,

3109
02:29:37.338 --> 02:29:38.230 line:15%
like, 20 minutes before I do?

3110
02:29:39.950 --> 02:29:41.774 line:15%
Five miles is no fucking joke.

3111
02:29:41.774 --> 02:29:42.655 line:15%
No, it's not.
Can you not

3112
02:29:42.655 --> 02:29:45.671 line:15%
hear the music, Sam?
But I'm also pretty dope.

3113
02:29:45.671 --> 02:29:46.504 line:15%
Okay, there you go.

3114
02:29:46.504 --> 02:29:50.480 line:15%
So, 30 minutes before I do?

3115
02:29:50.480 --> 02:29:53.200 line:15%
Yasha, if you're awake, let's go get your bracies.

3116
02:29:54.230 --> 02:29:56.126 line:15%
Wow.
Okay.

3117
02:29:56.126 --> 02:29:58.540 line:15%
(laughter)

3118
02:29:58.540 --> 02:29:59.373 line:15%
What the?

3119
02:30:01.152 --> 02:30:02.627 line:15%
ASHLEY: (drawn out) What?

3120
02:30:02.627 --> 02:30:03.558 line:15%
(laughter)

3121
02:30:03.558 --> 02:30:04.743 line:15%
SAM: You talk that way now?!

3122
02:30:04.743 --> 02:30:05.913 line:15%
Oh my god!

3123
02:30:05.913 --> 02:30:07.049 line:15%
(laughter)

3124
02:30:07.049 --> 02:30:09.816 line:15%
TALIESIN: Wow, yeah--
ASHLEY: Cool.

3125
02:30:09.816 --> 02:30:11.269 line:15%
TALIESIN: Okay.
SAM: Good night's sleep.

3126
02:30:11.269 --> 02:30:13.970 line:15%
TALIESIN: Okay.
ASHLEY: Wow, wow, wow, wow, wow.

3127
02:30:13.970 --> 02:30:16.670 line:15%
Okay, whoa, whoa, whoa, wow.

3128
02:30:16.670 --> 02:30:19.370 line:15%
That changes so many things.

3129
02:30:19.370 --> 02:30:21.250 line:15%
This is so cool.

3130
02:30:21.250 --> 02:30:23.632 line:15%
LAURA: Whoa, your attacks are going
to be better and everything.

3131
02:30:23.632 --> 02:30:25.730 line:15%
ASHLEY: (exhaling)

3132
02:30:25.730 --> 02:30:29.603 line:15%
Yeah, so I need to go get those bracers, but

3133
02:30:31.560 --> 02:30:34.980 line:15%
I wonder if maybe they'll give us a deal. (laughs)

3134
02:30:36.028 --> 02:30:38.002 line:15%
SAM: Do you not have enough money? Didn't we already pay?

3135
02:30:38.002 --> 02:30:40.590
ASHLEY: Well, I paid half.

3136
02:30:40.590 --> 02:30:42.620 line:15%
SAM: How much do you owe?

3137
02:30:42.620 --> 02:30:46.520 line:15%
ASHLEY: About 2,000 bones.

3138
02:30:46.520 --> 02:30:49.103 line:15%
SAM: How much do you have?

3139
02:30:52.750 --> 02:30:56.944 line:15%
ASHLEY: I currently have about just under that.

3140
02:30:56.944 --> 02:30:58.101 line:15%
LAURA: Okay--

3141
02:30:58.101 --> 02:30:59.333 line:15%
SAM: Jester can maybe chip in.

3142
02:30:59.333 --> 02:31:00.410 line:15%
LAURA: Yeah, I can--
ASHLEY: No, no, no,

3143
02:31:00.410 --> 02:31:03.207 line:15%
no, it's, no, I don't want you guys chipping in anymore.

3144
02:31:03.207 --> 02:31:04.100 line:15%
I can figure this out.
LIAM: So are we

3145
02:31:04.100 --> 02:31:05.970 line:15%
going to-- *heilige**.

3146
02:31:06.820 --> 02:31:10.210 line:15%
I don't know, I read that book, I finished it.

3147
02:31:10.210 --> 02:31:12.040 line:15%
But I feel, like, very different.

3148
02:31:12.040 --> 02:31:13.370 line:15%
I got that book from Caleb, you know.

3149
02:31:13.370 --> 02:31:16.083 line:15%
I think we may have a spider problem in the house.

3150
02:31:16.083 --> 02:31:17.743 line:15%
(laughter)

3151
02:31:17.743 --> 02:31:19.900 line:15%
We should pass that book around.

3152
02:31:19.900 --> 02:31:22.900 line:15%
That extra layer that I had, it's now just like (sucks).

3153
02:31:22.900 --> 02:31:24.740 line:15%
Yeah, where is that book now, anyway?

3154
02:31:26.970 --> 02:31:30.950 line:15%
You have the book.
It is, it's here.

3155
02:31:30.950 --> 02:31:32.930 line:15%
Oh.
Do you want to read it,

3156
02:31:32.930 --> 02:31:34.480 line:15%
Fjord, since you gave it to me?

3157
02:31:35.360 --> 02:31:37.120 line:15%
I mean, it's clearly got some sort of

3158
02:31:37.120 --> 02:31:40.098 line:15%
a regiment you're benefiting from.

3159
02:31:40.098 --> 02:31:41.889 line:15%
Well it, you know what's weird about it is, like--

3160
02:31:41.889 --> 02:31:43.180 line:15%
Can I borrow your P90X discs?

3161
02:31:43.180 --> 02:31:44.700 line:15%
It's got, like, words in it but

3162
02:31:44.700 --> 02:31:47.010 line:15%
it seems just, like, lame now.

3163
02:31:47.010 --> 02:31:49.380 line:15%
Yeah, like not magical anymore.

3164
02:31:49.380 --> 02:31:51.620 line:15%
It seems like when I was looking through it

3165
02:31:51.620 --> 02:31:53.810 line:15%
again this morning that the only thing

3166
02:31:53.810 --> 02:31:58.810 line:15%
that stuck is the sexy bits.
It still has smut in it.

3167
02:32:00.120 --> 02:32:02.290 line:15%
You can read it, Fjord, there's some good stuff in there.

3168
02:32:02.290 --> 02:32:05.570 line:15%
I thought I found a recipe for something in there, too.

3169
02:32:05.570 --> 02:32:06.830 line:15%
Yeah.
Yeah,

3170
02:32:06.830 --> 02:32:09.590 line:15%
some stuff in there I've never tried.

3171
02:32:09.590 --> 02:32:11.870 line:15%
Yeah, yeah.
I love a hot shower

3172
02:32:11.870 --> 02:32:15.130 line:15%
after a really long work out, you know,

3173
02:32:15.130 --> 02:32:17.590 line:15%
where you just, like, sit in the shower for--

3174
02:32:17.590 --> 02:32:19.050 line:15%
Shower.
Hey, Yasha.

3175
02:32:19.050 --> 02:32:21.620 line:15%
Shower.
Yeah,

3176
02:32:21.620 --> 02:32:24.180 line:15%
I think I must must've had a good--

3177
02:32:24.180 --> 02:32:25.400 line:15%
Are we commenting on this?

3178
02:32:25.400 --> 02:32:26.490 line:15%
Are we talking about this?
She's shredded.

3179
02:32:26.490 --> 02:32:27.770 line:15%
We're talking about it, yeah.

3180
02:32:27.770 --> 02:32:29.870 line:15%
I'm blaming spiders.
I just wasn't sure

3181
02:32:29.870 --> 02:32:31.450 line:15%
if I should, like, be coy or not.

3182
02:32:31.450 --> 02:32:33.050 line:15%
How did this happen overnight?

3183
02:32:34.830 --> 02:32:35.720 line:15%
I don't know.

3184
02:32:37.030 --> 02:32:40.860 line:15%
I didn't work out in my sleep or anything, I just,

3185
02:32:40.860 --> 02:32:44.620 line:15%
I think, I think maybe it was something that I ate.

3186
02:32:44.620 --> 02:32:47.330 line:15%
Like, you know when you're prepping for something

3187
02:32:47.330 --> 02:32:50.600 line:15%
and then, like, I've heard

3188
02:32:52.100 --> 02:32:52.933 line:15%
sometimes--

3189
02:32:52.933 --> 02:32:54.784 line:15%
Carbo loading?
Yeah.

3190
02:32:54.784 --> 02:32:55.617 line:15%
There was a lotta carbs in that meal.

3191
02:32:55.617 --> 02:32:58.039 line:15%
It was a very, I did use, I used a lotta yams,

3192
02:32:58.039 --> 02:33:00.250 line:15%
there's a lotta--
Maybe you

3193
02:33:00.250 --> 02:33:03.510 line:15%
ate poorly with Obann and now, with Caduceus, you know,

3194
02:33:03.510 --> 02:33:04.850 line:15%
after a couple--
Yeah.

3195
02:33:04.850 --> 02:33:06.290 line:15%
We should switch to gluten free wines.

3196
02:33:06.290 --> 02:33:08.180 line:15%
It was like a beet yam--
Yeah.

3197
02:33:08.180 --> 02:33:11.380 line:15%
Disgusting.
I have been working out

3198
02:33:11.380 --> 02:33:15.240 line:15%
since 6 a.m. and fucking she wakes up like that?

3199
02:33:15.240 --> 02:33:16.790 line:15%
You look great, Beau.
I'll make some more

3200
02:33:16.790 --> 02:33:18.310 line:15%
brussel sprouts, whatever is necessary.

3201
02:33:18.310 --> 02:33:19.990 line:15%
You're so cut.
Thank you.

3202
02:33:19.990 --> 02:33:21.540 line:15%
I mean, I learned a lot of--

3203
02:33:21.540 --> 02:33:23.300 line:15%
It suits your body, you know?

3204
02:33:23.300 --> 02:33:25.240 line:15%
Like, you're perfect, just the way you are.

3205
02:33:25.240 --> 02:33:26.950 line:15%
You're like diamonds, you're just--

3206
02:33:26.950 --> 02:33:27.783 line:15%
You know what?

3207
02:33:27.783 --> 02:33:31.480 line:15%
Maybe aasimars have, like, a second puberty, you know?

3208
02:33:31.480 --> 02:33:33.810 line:15%
Like, you just hit it, you just hit it last night.

3209
02:33:33.810 --> 02:33:34.710 line:15%
How old are you?

3210
02:33:37.316 --> 02:33:39.650 line:15%
I actually don't really know.

3211
02:33:39.650 --> 02:33:41.640 line:15%
There you go, you just hit it.

3212
02:33:41.640 --> 02:33:44.070 line:15%
Yeah, it's possible.

3213
02:33:44.070 --> 02:33:46.900 line:15%
I don't know much about--
Do you smell worse?

3214
02:33:46.900 --> 02:33:49.518 line:15%
Like, did your BO just (whistles) through the roof?

3215
02:33:49.518 --> 02:33:52.490 line:15%
(sniffing)

3216
02:33:52.490 --> 02:33:55.224 line:15%
How do you smell?
I smell like a crayon.

3217
02:33:55.224 --> 02:33:57.474 line:15%
(laughter)

3218
02:34:01.320 --> 02:34:02.870 line:15%
That's a good smell.

3219
02:34:02.870 --> 02:34:04.240 line:15%
(laughter)

3220
02:34:04.240 --> 02:34:05.647 line:15%
You know.

3221
02:34:05.647 --> 02:34:07.897 line:15%
(laughter)

3222
02:34:11.400 --> 02:34:13.654 line:15%
That's a good smell.
And we all went there.

3223
02:34:13.654 --> 02:34:15.904 line:15%
(laughter)

3224
02:34:19.424 --> 02:34:20.620 line:15%
(chair scraping)

3225
02:34:20.620 --> 02:34:21.910 line:15%
There's a reason for that and

3226
02:34:21.910 --> 02:34:24.340 line:15%
a story I will tell you all later.

3227
02:34:24.340 --> 02:34:25.840 line:15%
All right.
Why?

3228
02:34:25.840 --> 02:34:27.810 line:15%
What?
Deep backstory cut.

3229
02:34:27.810 --> 02:34:28.643 line:15%
You did.

3230
02:34:29.875 --> 02:34:31.100 line:15%
(laughter)

3231
02:34:31.100 --> 02:34:32.970 line:15%
It's a deep story--
Also would've called it.

3232
02:34:32.970 --> 02:34:35.550 line:15%
I kind of want to know, can you just tell us right now?

3233
02:34:35.550 --> 02:34:36.383 line:15%
On our way.

3234
02:34:36.383 --> 02:34:37.216 line:15%
We'll go get the bracers.

3235
02:34:37.216 --> 02:34:39.224 line:15%
We're walking and talking, walking and talking.

3236
02:34:39.224 --> 02:34:42.380 line:15%
Okay.
Um, yeah.

3237
02:34:42.380 --> 02:34:44.100 line:15%
So, as a group, you leave the house

3238
02:34:44.100 --> 02:34:46.110 line:15%
and make the way towards the Marble Tomes Conservatory.

3239
02:34:46.110 --> 02:34:47.850 line:15%
Caleb, go, don't talk to me, but Caleb's going to

3240
02:34:47.850 --> 02:34:49.960 line:15%
do research at home with the spell stuff.

3241
02:34:49.960 --> 02:34:51.340 line:15%
Okay, gotcha.
'Kay.

3242
02:34:52.270 --> 02:34:53.103 line:15%
Okay.

3243
02:34:54.640 --> 02:34:55.870 line:15%
So, you go ahead and make your way

3244
02:34:55.870 --> 02:34:58.590 line:15%
towards the Marble Tomes Conservatory,

3245
02:34:58.590 --> 02:35:00.280 line:15%
referring to a different clerk,

3246
02:35:00.280 --> 02:35:03.990 line:15%
but within a short period of time, you are brought to

3247
02:35:03.990 --> 02:35:06.500 line:15%
the door of the familiar face of Enchanter Yun,

3248
02:35:07.380 --> 02:35:09.860 line:15%
who steps out after being summoned.

3249
02:35:10.940 --> 02:35:11.920 line:15%
"Oh, hello.

3250
02:35:11.920 --> 02:35:14.990 line:15%
"There is quite a few people here, it appears.

3251
02:35:16.931 --> 02:35:19.131 line:15%
"But you returned."
Yes, I have returned.

3252
02:35:20.290 --> 02:35:24.360 line:15%
I have returned and I came to pick up the bracers

3253
02:35:24.360 --> 02:35:26.510 line:15%
if they are ready, but--
They are ready.

3254
02:35:27.840 --> 02:35:29.900 line:15%
How much did I owe again?

3255
02:35:29.900 --> 02:35:31.420 line:15%
Was it?
Let me check.

3256
02:35:31.420 --> 02:35:32.253 line:15%
Okay.

3257
02:35:32.253 --> 02:35:33.810 line:15%
And he goes and slips back and you

3258
02:35:33.810 --> 02:35:35.910 line:15%
look through the crack in the door.

3259
02:35:35.910 --> 02:35:38.840 line:15%
There's a bunch of shelves containing all sorts of

3260
02:35:38.840 --> 02:35:43.360 line:15%
jars and various, you know, collected materials

3261
02:35:43.360 --> 02:35:45.820 line:15%
that are probably used in the enchantment process

3262
02:35:45.820 --> 02:35:49.730 line:15%
or the creation of various enchanted items.

3263
02:35:49.730 --> 02:35:51.456 line:15%
Eventually he comes back, about a minute later,

3264
02:35:51.456 --> 02:35:53.520 line:15%
and goes, "Here on the register,

3265
02:35:53.520 --> 02:35:56.420 line:15%
"we have you still owing 2,000 gold pieces."

3266
02:35:56.420 --> 02:35:58.300 line:15%
Okay, that is what I thought.

3267
02:35:58.300 --> 02:35:59.170 line:15%
Okay so,

3268
02:36:01.740 --> 02:36:03.260 line:15%
I might not be ready to

3269
02:36:03.260 --> 02:36:04.640 line:15%
pick them up just yet--
She's ready, she's ready.

3270
02:36:04.640 --> 02:36:06.723 line:15%
She's absolutely ready.
No, no, no, no.

3271
02:36:06.723 --> 02:36:08.160 line:15%
I'm not, I'm going to give you what I have,

3272
02:36:08.160 --> 02:36:09.190 line:15%
which is, um,

3273
02:36:10.530 --> 02:36:12.250 line:15%
I have, um,

3274
02:36:14.128 --> 02:36:16.110 line:15%
here's 1,710 gold pieces.

3275
02:36:16.110 --> 02:36:19.030 line:15%
Here's 300, well, here's 200 more gold.

3276
02:36:19.030 --> 02:36:21.830 line:15%
And here's the other 110?

3277
02:36:22.674 --> 02:36:23.570 line:15%
Nope, nope.
No we don't--

3278
02:36:23.570 --> 02:36:25.500 line:15%
130.
Yeah, this is all--

3279
02:36:25.500 --> 02:36:29.620 line:15%
290 is left.
Yup.

3280
02:36:29.620 --> 02:36:30.933 line:15%
I promise I'll--
No, we paid it all.

3281
02:36:30.933 --> 02:36:33.080 line:15%
That's everything, that's everything.

3282
02:36:33.080 --> 02:36:36.300 line:15%
He just accepts all the gold and goes, "Very well.

3283
02:36:36.300 --> 02:36:38.050 line:15%
"I will retrieve them for you now."

3284
02:36:39.630 --> 02:36:41.110 line:15%
Leaves them, comes back.

3285
02:36:41.110 --> 02:36:43.410 line:15%
The bracers that you had originally

3286
02:36:43.410 --> 02:36:45.260 line:15%
commissioned provided as part of it--

3287
02:36:47.815 --> 02:36:50.330 line:15%
Oh wait, so I can use that.

3288
02:36:50.330 --> 02:36:52.630 line:15%
Oh, it was counted in there, it was, it just, yeah.

3289
02:36:52.630 --> 02:36:53.800 line:15%
I understand.
Yeah.

3290
02:36:53.800 --> 02:36:55.140 line:15%
Okay.
So,

3291
02:36:55.140 --> 02:36:57.590 line:15%
it returns with the bracers--
I don't understand money.

3292
02:36:57.590 --> 02:36:58.423 line:15%
It's okay.

3293
02:36:58.423 --> 02:36:59.660 line:15%
As they were originally commissioned,

3294
02:36:59.660 --> 02:37:03.740 line:15%
now you see they've been intricately designed upon.

3295
02:37:03.740 --> 02:37:05.320 line:15%
There is all sorts of incredible

3296
02:37:05.320 --> 02:37:07.210 line:15%
scrolling and shapes, it looks almost like

3297
02:37:07.210 --> 02:37:09.510 line:15%
swirling flames across the sides of the metal.

3298
02:37:11.020 --> 02:37:12.830 line:15%
Sick.
They look beautiful.

3299
02:37:12.830 --> 02:37:16.030
Polished, fresh, new, unworn.

3300
02:37:16.030 --> 02:37:19.400 line:15%
And presents them to you and goes,

3301
02:37:19.400 --> 02:37:21.050 line:15%
"Just to make sure you are aware,

3302
02:37:22.957 --> 02:37:26.990 line:15%
"that equipment you are wearing with the horns,

3303
02:37:28.190 --> 02:37:29.800 line:15%
"they're not compatible together.

3304
02:37:29.800 --> 02:37:31.670 line:15%
"You will have to, if you are intending

3305
02:37:31.670 --> 02:37:33.480 line:15%
"to use these yourself or you can give them to

3306
02:37:33.480 --> 02:37:38.130 line:15%
"somebody else as a gift maybe, but just so you are aware."

3307
02:37:38.130 --> 02:37:39.700 line:15%
Okay.
Of course.

3308
02:37:39.700 --> 02:37:40.533 line:15%
Yes.
I'll,

3309
02:37:41.710 --> 02:37:42.543 line:15%
good day.

3310
02:37:44.232 --> 02:37:45.740 line:15%
What's it going to, what does, what does your armor do?

3311
02:37:45.740 --> 02:37:47.960 line:15%
It is, I know it's like that armor

3312
02:37:47.960 --> 02:37:49.570 line:15%
that you were made to wear before,

3313
02:37:49.570 --> 02:37:51.610 line:15%
but is it like special armor or something?

3314
02:37:51.610 --> 02:37:53.370 line:15%
Mm-hmm.
Yeah.

3315
02:37:53.370 --> 02:37:55.430 line:15%
That was, they sold what now?

3316
02:37:56.600 --> 02:37:59.230 line:15%
Enchanter Yun, it doesn't sell things

3317
02:37:59.230 --> 02:38:04.230 line:15%
necessarily as it is a, partially, from what you would know,

3318
02:38:04.970 --> 02:38:06.460 line:15%
and from Caleb's interaction there,

3319
02:38:06.460 --> 02:38:09.260 line:15%
it's partially a conservatory for teaching

3320
02:38:09.260 --> 02:38:11.490 line:15%
the enchantment and creation of magical items,

3321
02:38:11.490 --> 02:38:13.890 line:15%
but they do commissions as well.

3322
02:38:13.890 --> 02:38:16.473 line:15%
(gentle music)

3323
02:38:17.600 --> 02:38:19.400 line:15%
What does it do, the bracers?

3324
02:38:21.610 --> 02:38:23.160 line:15%
I think they just,

3325
02:38:26.120 --> 02:38:27.620 line:15%
protection, I don't, you know.

3326
02:38:30.139 --> 02:38:31.289 line:15%
Mm.
Do we have a--

3327
02:38:33.590 --> 02:38:36.053 line:15%
Paper?
Card, card, paper.

3328
02:38:36.053 --> 02:38:37.070 line:15%
Are they just bracers plus--

3329
02:38:37.070 --> 02:38:40.520 line:15%
No, Bracers of Defense is what they are in D&amp;D Beyond.

3330
02:38:42.060 --> 02:38:44.260 line:15%
So, that would be--
That's what I have.

3331
02:38:45.702 --> 02:38:46.535 line:15%
Correct?
Yeah.

3332
02:38:46.535 --> 02:38:47.372 line:15%
That is what you have?
Yeah, it gives a--

3333
02:38:47.372 --> 02:38:49.370 line:15%
Plus two to your armor class.

3334
02:38:49.370 --> 02:38:50.680 line:15%
Plus two.
Tight.

3335
02:38:50.680 --> 02:38:52.400 line:15%
As long as you're not wearing armor.

3336
02:38:52.400 --> 02:38:53.630 line:15%
As long as you're not wearing--

3337
02:38:53.630 --> 02:38:55.080 line:15%
So, what's your unarmored--

3338
02:38:56.380 --> 02:38:57.910 line:15%
Gosh, I wonder if somebody else should take these?

3339
02:38:57.910 --> 02:38:59.660 line:15%
Oh, easy, easy way to see, actually,

3340
02:38:59.660 --> 02:39:03.870 line:15%
is just go to your, it's just remove that.

3341
02:39:03.870 --> 02:39:04.820 line:15%
That's all right.

3342
02:39:06.110 --> 02:39:08.930 line:15%
Oh, I took my--
Remove.

3343
02:39:10.320 --> 02:39:11.880 line:15%
Oh, just--
So, it's the same.

3344
02:39:11.880 --> 02:39:13.010 line:15%
It's the same.
No armor--

3345
02:39:13.010 --> 02:39:14.380 line:15%
But now you don't have to wear that

3346
02:39:14.380 --> 02:39:16.980 line:15%
awful armor that Obann made you wear.

3347
02:39:16.980 --> 02:39:19.240 line:15%
Is that why you smell like a crayon?

3348
02:39:19.240 --> 02:39:22.190 line:15%
Is it the armor?
I don't think so, I think--

3349
02:39:22.190 --> 02:39:27.190 line:15%
Why do you smell like a crayon?

3350
02:39:28.420 --> 02:39:30.188 line:15%
Gosh, I don't know what to do.

3351
02:39:30.188 --> 02:39:31.021 line:15%
Does she have that funky thing where if she

3352
02:39:31.021 --> 02:39:32.360 line:15%
wears no armor, her AC's higher,

3353
02:39:32.360 --> 02:39:33.893 line:15%
unarmored--
Depends.

3354
02:39:33.893 --> 02:39:35.340 line:15%
She gets to add her dexterity

3355
02:39:35.340 --> 02:39:37.540 line:15%
and her constitution modifier without armor.

3356
02:39:38.750 --> 02:39:39.583 line:15%
Mm.
Oh.

3357
02:39:39.583 --> 02:39:40.416 line:15%
Is how it works.

3358
02:39:40.416 --> 02:39:42.380 line:15%
So, it's way better without armor.

3359
02:39:42.380 --> 02:39:43.350 line:15%
Well, it depends on how high

3360
02:39:43.350 --> 02:39:45.100 line:15%
your dexterity and constitution is.

3361
02:39:47.410 --> 02:39:48.860 line:15%
I need to think about this.

3362
02:39:51.020 --> 02:39:51.853 line:15%
Well, the other--
Well,

3363
02:39:51.853 --> 02:39:54.130 line:15%
plus the bracers you'll go back up to 17.

3364
02:39:56.204 --> 02:39:58.030 line:15%
Yeah, they're both the same.

3365
02:39:58.030 --> 02:40:02.180 line:15%
This one, this is, this is--
Just other stuff, though?

3366
02:40:02.180 --> 02:40:04.240 line:15%
Yeah.
That's true.

3367
02:40:05.740 --> 02:40:08.790 line:15%
I need to think about this for a second.

3368
02:40:13.276 --> 02:40:16.987 line:15%
Yeah, I need to think about this for a little bit.

3369
02:40:16.987 --> 02:40:20.220 line:15%
Caduceus, is there anything we need to

3370
02:40:20.220 --> 02:40:23.880 line:15%
pick up on our, as we prepare to voyage?

3371
02:40:24.850 --> 02:40:25.683 line:15%
I mean, we obviously have to go back

3372
02:40:25.683 --> 02:40:28.230 line:15%
and get Caleb and stuff, but I mean, do you have a--

3373
02:40:28.230 --> 02:40:30.870 line:15%
Matter with diamond, but other than that--

3374
02:40:30.870 --> 02:40:33.590 line:15%
That's right, we could use some diamonds.

3375
02:40:33.590 --> 02:40:34.957 line:15%
How many?

3376
02:40:34.957 --> 02:40:36.510 line:15%
As many as we can find.
As many as we can get.

3377
02:40:36.510 --> 02:40:37.610 line:15%
Could probably steal some.
Because, you know,

3378
02:40:37.610 --> 02:40:41.000 line:15%
we, they have to be good diamonds, not,

3379
02:40:41.000 --> 02:40:42.840 line:15%
they can't just be little dinky diamonds.

3380
02:40:42.840 --> 02:40:44.550 line:15%
Give me two hours.

3381
02:40:44.550 --> 02:40:47.070 line:15%
We need a 300 and a 500 worth.

3382
02:40:50.030 --> 02:40:53.000 line:15%
I'll go buy them. (laughs)
Aww.

3383
02:40:54.510 --> 02:40:56.030 line:15%
I guess.

3384
02:40:56.030 --> 02:40:58.660 line:15%
Do you want to go on a shopping trip on your lonesome?

3385
02:40:58.660 --> 02:41:00.070 line:15%
Do you want some company?
Sure.

3386
02:41:00.070 --> 02:41:02.590 line:15%
I'll go with her.
All righty.

3387
02:41:04.850 --> 02:41:06.340 line:15%
Looking for diamonds.

3388
02:41:06.340 --> 02:41:07.670 line:15%
Easy enough to find.

3389
02:41:09.580 --> 02:41:13.317 line:15%
You return to an individual known as Besh Turmin,

3390
02:41:14.379 --> 02:41:16.680 line:15%
who we had previously had an encounter with.

3391
02:41:18.948 --> 02:41:21.770 line:15%
If you'd like to go to the Turmin's Tinctures and Tonics.

3392
02:41:21.770 --> 02:41:25.540 line:15%
You return to this, this, this unique shop

3393
02:41:25.540 --> 02:41:27.410 line:15%
run by a duergar figure.

3394
02:41:28.880 --> 02:41:32.760 line:15%
So, stocky, you know, red crew cut figure

3395
02:41:32.760 --> 02:41:35.160 line:15%
with this giant, like, (wheezes) of a red beard,

3396
02:41:36.507 --> 02:41:37.340 line:15%
you know, dark duergar skin.

3397
02:41:37.340 --> 02:41:40.000 line:15%
As you walk in, he goes like, "Hey, can I help ye?"

3398
02:41:42.278 --> 02:41:45.410 line:15%
Oh hi, um, you're a jeweler, correct?

3399
02:41:46.510 --> 02:41:50.930 line:15%
No, but I can get ye jewels?

3400
02:41:50.930 --> 02:41:55.430 line:15%
That's all we need.
We're returning patrons.

3401
02:41:55.430 --> 02:41:56.760 line:15%
Yes, we've been here--
Right, right.

3402
02:41:56.760 --> 02:42:00.160 line:15%
I recognize you, okay.
What's your name again?

3403
02:42:00.160 --> 02:42:01.510 line:15%
I'm sorry.
Besh.

3404
02:42:01.510 --> 02:42:03.100 line:15%
Besh, that's right, Besh, Besh.

3405
02:42:03.100 --> 02:42:04.890 line:15%
But you can just call me Turmin.

3406
02:42:04.890 --> 02:42:08.210 line:15%
That's what most folks say.
Is that your last name?

3407
02:42:08.210 --> 02:42:09.510 line:15%
Aye.
Oh, Besh Turmin.

3408
02:42:12.460 --> 02:42:15.930 line:15%
Yes, we're interested in some fine jewels.

3409
02:42:15.930 --> 02:42:18.440 line:15%
So, whatcha looking for?
Two diamonds.

3410
02:42:18.440 --> 02:42:21.190 line:15%
How big?
Like, a this and a that.

3411
02:42:23.310 --> 02:42:25.130 line:15%
You point out the specific sizes

3412
02:42:25.130 --> 02:42:26.630 line:15%
that previous spells have used, which, that,

3413
02:42:26.630 --> 02:42:27.830 line:15%
you know, they're not too big,

3414
02:42:27.830 --> 02:42:30.960 line:15%
they're not like giant, handheld things.

3415
02:42:30.960 --> 02:42:32.850 line:15%
"Okay, I'll have to ask around.

3416
02:42:32.850 --> 02:42:36.100 line:15%
"Might take a few hours, but I can look into it."

3417
02:42:36.100 --> 02:42:37.720 line:15%
Oh, you don't have them on site.

3418
02:42:37.720 --> 02:42:40.380 line:15%
No, I'm not a jeweler, but I know people who are jewelers

3419
02:42:40.380 --> 02:42:42.150 line:15%
that I can get those for ya, lickety split.

3420
02:42:42.150 --> 02:42:46.110 line:15%
So, you're a middleman.
Aye, for certain things.

3421
02:42:46.110 --> 02:42:47.710 line:15%
We could just go straight to

3422
02:42:47.710 --> 02:42:49.730 line:15%
the jeweler, then, maybe get--

3423
02:42:49.730 --> 02:42:51.761 line:15%
Do you know where the jewelers are?

3424
02:42:51.761 --> 02:42:52.672 line:15%
(laughter)

3425
02:42:52.672 --> 02:42:54.420 line:15%
I don't, but if you told me where they were.

3426
02:42:54.420 --> 02:42:55.860 line:15%
But then I'd be screwing myself

3427
02:42:55.860 --> 02:42:56.840 line:15%
outta some coin, wouldn't I?

3428
02:42:56.840 --> 02:42:59.170 line:15%
This gentleman's connections are worth the coin.

3429
02:42:59.170 --> 02:43:01.950 line:15%
Ah, that's a smart little half-orc, eh?

3430
02:43:03.190 --> 02:43:04.430 line:15%
Not little, all right?

3431
02:43:04.430 --> 02:43:07.570 line:15%
I ran five miles this morning, it's a process.

3432
02:43:07.570 --> 02:43:09.170 line:15%
Congratulations.
Thank you.

3433
02:43:09.170 --> 02:43:11.520 line:15%
I think we should pay this gentleman.

3434
02:43:11.520 --> 02:43:13.740 line:15%
Do we have to pay now or upon delivery?

3435
02:43:13.740 --> 02:43:15.760 line:15%
You can pay now if you want to, but--

3436
02:43:16.790 --> 02:43:18.730 line:15%
How 'bout later?
On pick up, all right.

3437
02:43:18.730 --> 02:43:20.070 line:15%
I'll see what I can find.

3438
02:43:20.070 --> 02:43:21.370 line:15%
Thank you.
No worries.

3439
02:43:21.370 --> 02:43:22.203 line:15%
And if they're not to your interest,

3440
02:43:22.203 --> 02:43:25.830 line:15%
we've got all sorts of delightful tonics and balms

3441
02:43:25.830 --> 02:43:28.920 line:15%
and salves and things to help with indigestion,

3442
02:43:28.920 --> 02:43:32.410 line:15%
we've got things to hide, got all sorts of' things.

3443
02:43:32.410 --> 02:43:33.790 line:15%
And he starts just pointing across the room

3444
02:43:33.790 --> 02:43:35.920 line:15%
and there's just these little labels on them and--

3445
02:43:35.920 --> 02:43:37.940 line:15%
Is it a he, she?
It's a he.

3446
02:43:39.340 --> 02:43:40.540 line:15%
Did you--
From what you can tell.

3447
02:43:40.540 --> 02:43:43.520 line:15%
Those are potions that you have, right Fjord?

3448
02:43:44.530 --> 02:43:46.806 line:15%
All of these?
Yeah, those are ours.

3449
02:43:46.806 --> 02:43:49.050 line:15%
Do you own those?
No,

3450
02:43:49.050 --> 02:43:51.300 line:15%
I believe they belong to the group.

3451
02:43:51.300 --> 02:43:53.190 line:15%
But I mean have you passed them out?

3452
02:43:54.631 --> 02:43:55.710 line:15%
I don't think so.
I don't think so

3453
02:43:55.710 --> 02:43:57.270 line:15%
or have you guys, we could consolidate it

3454
02:43:57.270 --> 02:43:58.558 line:15%
right now--
We don't

3455
02:43:58.558 --> 02:43:59.619 line:15%
need any more is what I'm saying.

3456
02:43:59.619 --> 02:44:00.930 line:15%
Oh my, nope, we're good.

3457
02:44:00.930 --> 02:44:03.470 line:15%
Any magical potions or magical oils?

3458
02:44:04.660 --> 02:44:07.680 line:15%
Ee, I, most of it's topical.

3459
02:44:07.680 --> 02:44:10.680 line:15%
I, you know, folks here don't get a lotta sunlight,

3460
02:44:10.680 --> 02:44:13.610 line:15%
so for those that wants it, I got a few things to help

3461
02:44:13.610 --> 02:44:16.290 line:15%
just get some good vitamins in the top surface.

3462
02:44:17.930 --> 02:44:20.510 line:15%
Let's see, yeah, things magical.

3463
02:44:20.510 --> 02:44:24.380 line:15%
Some vitamin D rub.
Yeah. (laughs)

3464
02:44:24.380 --> 02:44:26.160 line:15%
We got some willowshade oil.

3465
02:44:26.160 --> 02:44:26.993 line:15%
What's that do?

3466
02:44:26.993 --> 02:44:29.450 line:15%
What's that?
It's a very rare fruit.

3467
02:44:29.450 --> 02:44:32.090 line:15%
It come from the willowshade plant.

3468
02:44:32.090 --> 02:44:34.090 line:15%
It's harvested far to the west.

3469
02:44:35.540 --> 02:44:37.480 line:15%
It's sort of, I think, a filling

3470
02:44:37.480 --> 02:44:41.120 line:15%
on the Menagerie Coast, I had it sent over.

3471
02:44:41.120 --> 02:44:43.760 line:15%
This, when you put it on, you want to put it on

3472
02:44:43.760 --> 02:44:45.800 line:15%
in advance if you want to, a little bit,

3473
02:44:45.800 --> 02:44:47.060 line:15%
I'm sure it feel a bit tingly,

3474
02:44:47.060 --> 02:44:49.500 line:15%
but there are things and dangers out there

3475
02:44:49.500 --> 02:44:52.690 line:15%
that make your skin get all cracky and turn to stone.

3476
02:44:52.690 --> 02:44:55.013 line:15%
Supposedly it helps with that.

3477
02:44:55.013 --> 02:44:55.846 line:15%
Oh.
It helps

3478
02:44:55.846 --> 02:44:58.372 line:15%
against things that turn your skin to stone.

3479
02:44:58.372 --> 02:44:59.205 line:15%
(gasping)

3480
02:44:59.205 --> 02:45:00.038 line:15%
I think so.

3481
02:45:00.038 --> 02:45:02.670 line:15%
We were looking for basilisk oil, remember?

3482
02:45:02.670 --> 02:45:06.020 line:15%
You should get it. (coos)
Is it basilisk oil?

3483
02:45:07.110 --> 02:45:09.030 line:15%
No, it's from a fruit.
Yeah.

3484
02:45:09.030 --> 02:45:12.680 line:15%
It's in like an acai berry, it's all the craze right now.

3485
02:45:12.680 --> 02:45:14.050 line:15%
How much does that cost?

3486
02:45:14.050 --> 02:45:17.950 line:15%
Ah, I've got two and it's 40 gold a piece.

3487
02:45:17.950 --> 02:45:19.540 line:15%
Oh, that seems reasonable.

3488
02:45:19.540 --> 02:45:21.640 line:15%
Fjord, pay the gentleman.
You got it.

3489
02:45:23.040 --> 02:45:24.420 line:15%
Boop.
80 gold,

3490
02:45:24.420 --> 02:45:26.020 line:15%
thank you very much.

3491
02:45:26.020 --> 02:45:28.310 line:15%
Willow wisp, what is it?
Willowbark.

3492
02:45:28.310 --> 02:45:29.730 line:15%
Willow--
Willowshade oil.

3493
02:45:29.730 --> 02:45:31.170 line:15%
Willowshade oil.
You got

3494
02:45:31.170 --> 02:45:32.520 line:15%
two of those you can mark.

3495
02:45:32.520 --> 02:45:34.976 line:15%
Great.
Willowshade oil.

3496
02:45:34.976 --> 02:45:36.830 line:15%
Look at that, that's cool.

3497
02:45:36.830 --> 02:45:39.780 line:15%
Thank you, we'll see you in a few hours.

3498
02:45:39.780 --> 02:45:40.613 line:15%
Aye, aye.

3499
02:45:41.750 --> 02:45:43.480 line:15%
While they're off doing that,

3500
02:45:43.480 --> 02:45:46.090 line:15%
I'm going to search out somewhere

3501
02:45:46.090 --> 02:45:49.400 line:15%
to look for something like beard oil,

3502
02:45:49.400 --> 02:45:51.500 line:15%
something that can make beards grow.

3503
02:45:53.910 --> 02:45:54.870 line:15%
Magic beard oil?

3504
02:45:56.800 --> 02:45:59.530 line:15%
Go ahead and make--
D&amp;D everyone now.

3505
02:45:59.530 --> 02:46:01.530 line:15%
Make an investigation check, I'll say.

3506
02:46:04.030 --> 02:46:05.250 line:15%
Eight.
Eight.

3507
02:46:06.820 --> 02:46:07.653 line:15%
Yeah.

3508
02:46:09.210 --> 02:46:12.840 line:15%
About 20 minutes after they leave

3509
02:46:12.840 --> 02:46:15.770 line:15%
Turmin's Tinctures and Tonics.
Figured as much. (laughs)

3510
02:46:15.770 --> 02:46:17.270 line:15%
You end up in the same place.

3511
02:46:17.270 --> 02:46:19.520 line:15%
"Hi, can I help you?"
Hi, yes.

3512
02:46:19.520 --> 02:46:23.350 line:15%
I am looking for some, like, oil or something

3513
02:46:23.350 --> 02:46:24.960 line:15%
you put on your face to make a beard

3514
02:46:24.960 --> 02:46:27.540 line:15%
grow better.
Aye?

3515
02:46:27.540 --> 02:46:29.040 line:15%
That we've got.
Oh, really?

3516
02:46:29.940 --> 02:46:32.200 line:15%
Aye, 'pends how many applications you're looking for,

3517
02:46:32.200 --> 02:46:36.090 line:15%
but we've got some in big vials, small vials, all sorts.

3518
02:46:37.030 --> 02:46:38.000 line:15%
Sorry, it's my assistant.

3519
02:46:38.000 --> 02:46:39.900 line:15%
She's delivering snacks for the time being.

3520
02:46:39.900 --> 02:46:41.130 line:15%
Oh, wonderful.

3521
02:46:41.130 --> 02:46:44.040 line:15%
What kind of snacks?
Well, they're not for you.

3522
02:46:44.040 --> 02:46:45.119 line:15%
I don't feel like I should've

3523
02:46:45.119 --> 02:46:46.280 line:15%
brought these donuts right here.

3524
02:46:46.280 --> 02:46:48.990 line:15%
But aye, how much you looking for?

3525
02:46:48.990 --> 02:46:50.250 line:15%
Would you like a big vial?

3526
02:46:50.250 --> 02:46:52.700 line:15%
I don't know, it's just for one person's beard.

3527
02:46:52.700 --> 02:46:54.230 line:15%
But I don't know how much work it's going to

3528
02:46:54.230 --> 02:46:56.230 line:15%
take to really get it to grow, you know.

3529
02:46:58.132 --> 02:47:01.520 line:15%
Are they perhaps a duergar?

3530
02:47:01.520 --> 02:47:03.480 line:15%
No.
Oh, it's going to be

3531
02:47:03.480 --> 02:47:06.410 line:15%
a tough push for a beard then, no matter who they are.

3532
02:47:06.410 --> 02:47:08.440 line:15%
I'd recommend getting a larger vial.

3533
02:47:08.440 --> 02:47:10.730 line:15%
How much is that?
That would be,

3534
02:47:10.730 --> 02:47:13.440 line:15%
it's somewhere around 100 to 150 applications

3535
02:47:13.440 --> 02:47:15.260 line:15%
and it takes about, standard,

3536
02:47:16.426 --> 02:47:19.580 line:15%
non-duergar lineage individuals,

3537
02:47:19.580 --> 02:47:21.400 line:15%
about half that amount to grow a full beard

3538
02:47:21.400 --> 02:47:24.150 line:15%
in a short parody of time, so I'd say that

3539
02:47:24.150 --> 02:47:26.570 line:15%
puts you about, ah, 55 gold.

3540
02:47:27.830 --> 02:47:28.960 line:15%
And then, like, what do they do?

3541
02:47:28.960 --> 02:47:31.130 line:15%
Like, put it on, like three times a day or like?

3542
02:47:31.130 --> 02:47:32.120 line:15%
In the morning when they wake up

3543
02:47:32.120 --> 02:47:34.116 line:15%
and at night before they go to sleep.

3544
02:47:34.116 --> 02:47:34.949 line:15%
(wheezing laughter)

3545
02:47:34.949 --> 02:47:35.782 line:15%
Okay.

3546
02:47:35.782 --> 02:47:38.160 line:15%
And then, so how long will it take to grow a beard then?

3547
02:47:38.160 --> 02:47:40.010 line:15%
Depends on who it is, but it'll be

3548
02:47:40.010 --> 02:47:41.980 line:15%
thrice as fast as it would be normally.

3549
02:47:44.220 --> 02:47:45.790 line:15%
Most likely.

3550
02:47:45.790 --> 02:47:47.780 line:15%
Or it could just be like a normal beard growth

3551
02:47:47.780 --> 02:47:50.880 line:15%
because isn't that how long it normally takes?

3552
02:47:50.880 --> 02:47:52.880 line:15%
I don't know, I don't have a beard.

3553
02:47:52.880 --> 02:47:55.350 line:15%
Trust me.
Okay!

3554
02:47:56.340 --> 02:47:57.349 line:15%
All right.

3555
02:47:57.349 --> 02:47:58.649 line:15%
(laughter)

3556
02:47:58.649 --> 02:47:59.482 line:15%
(clapping)

3557
02:47:59.482 --> 02:48:00.920 line:15%
50 gold, you said?
55.

3558
02:48:00.920 --> 02:48:01.753 line:15%
55.

3559
02:48:03.650 --> 02:48:04.890 line:15%
This could definitely end well.

3560
02:48:04.890 --> 02:48:08.030 line:15%
And for this, I get a giant vial of oil.

3561
02:48:08.030 --> 02:48:09.090 line:15%
Of beard oil.

3562
02:48:09.090 --> 02:48:11.630 line:15%
God, the juxtaposition to Vex is just stellar.

3563
02:48:11.630 --> 02:48:13.456 line:15%
So great, isn't it?

3564
02:48:13.456 --> 02:48:14.289 line:15%
(laughter)

3565
02:48:14.289 --> 02:48:16.141 line:15%
Okay, I--
Okay.

3566
02:48:16.141 --> 02:48:16.974 line:15%
(laughter)

3567
02:48:16.974 --> 02:48:17.807 line:15%
(imitated chicken noise)

3568
02:48:17.807 --> 02:48:19.020 line:15%
This is fine.
Beard oil.

3569
02:48:19.922 --> 02:48:21.951 line:15%
Thank you so much.
Of course, any time.

3570
02:48:21.951 --> 02:48:23.230 line:15%
If you need more of that, if you've got more friends

3571
02:48:23.230 --> 02:48:25.881 line:15%
who's trying to grow out something fancy like this,

3572
02:48:25.881 --> 02:48:27.700 line:15%
(laughs) you let me know.
Okay.

3573
02:48:28.554 --> 02:48:29.760 line:15%
While this is happening,

3574
02:48:29.760 --> 02:48:30.870 line:15%
you're doing your research, Caleb.

3575
02:48:30.870 --> 02:48:32.119 line:15%
Go ahead and roll an--
Ah yeah, this is on, oh,

3576
02:48:32.119 --> 02:48:35.900 line:15%
I've already cast Fortune's Favor on myself.

3577
02:48:35.900 --> 02:48:37.020 line:15%
All righty.

3578
02:48:37.020 --> 02:48:39.190 line:15%
So, this is for Nott's problem.

3579
02:48:40.502 --> 02:48:41.335 line:15%
(dice clattering)

3580
02:48:41.335 --> 02:48:43.310 line:15%
A burning wind of peace?
Yes.

3581
02:48:44.250 --> 02:48:46.590 line:15%
And here goes Fortune's Favor, see if I can do better.

3582
02:48:48.820 --> 02:48:50.260 line:15%
Both 13, so that is a 23.

3583
02:48:50.260 --> 02:48:52.449 line:15%
That's the worst, when--
A 23?

3584
02:48:52.449 --> 02:48:55.032 line:15%
(gentle music)

3585
02:48:57.040 --> 02:48:59.750 line:15%
You get to a point in this equation where you begin to

3586
02:48:59.750 --> 02:49:04.200 line:15%
see the light at the end of the tunnel in its design.

3587
02:49:06.090 --> 02:49:08.160 line:15%
Elements of it are still escaping you a bit

3588
02:49:08.160 --> 02:49:09.890 line:15%
and the materials that are going to be needed

3589
02:49:09.890 --> 02:49:13.311 line:15%
to experiment with the development of this

3590
02:49:13.311 --> 02:49:15.700 line:15%
is going to start getting a little,

3591
02:49:15.700 --> 02:49:17.140 line:15%
start costing you some money.

3592
02:49:17.140 --> 02:49:18.030 line:15%
While they're in this, you could

3593
02:49:18.030 --> 02:49:19.140 line:15%
rush out and pick up supplies.

3594
02:49:19.140 --> 02:49:20.770 line:15%
I'd say to continue this thread,

3595
02:49:20.770 --> 02:49:23.550 line:15%
it would cost you about 250 gold pieces

3596
02:49:23.550 --> 02:49:25.220 line:15%
to get everything you need to experiment

3597
02:49:25.220 --> 02:49:28.240 line:15%
with this next portion of the equation.

3598
02:49:28.240 --> 02:49:29.140 line:15%
I will do that, I will go

3599
02:49:29.140 --> 02:49:31.920 line:15%
running out helter skelter, papers--

3600
02:49:31.920 --> 02:49:33.520 line:15%
Easy enough to find based on the materials

3601
02:49:33.520 --> 02:49:35.240 line:15%
you've already tried to gather in this city.

3602
02:49:35.240 --> 02:49:36.940 line:15%
You come back, slam the door shut.

3603
02:49:36.940 --> 02:49:39.570 line:15%
You're in that obsessive beautiful mind mode.

3604
02:49:39.570 --> 02:49:41.360 line:15%
What's wrong, big guy?

3605
02:49:41.360 --> 02:49:43.655 line:15%
Focusing on it.
Magic stuff!

3606
02:49:43.655 --> 02:49:45.905 line:15%
(laughter)

3607
02:49:48.000 --> 02:49:50.185 line:15%
Continuing to push towards

3608
02:49:50.185 --> 02:49:53.230 line:15%
its development, it's getting close.

3609
02:49:53.230 --> 02:49:54.630 line:15%
And there's that element of, like,

3610
02:49:54.630 --> 02:49:55.650 line:15%
a breakthrough around the corner

3611
02:49:55.650 --> 02:49:58.530 line:15%
that's bothering you because it's eluding you.

3612
02:49:58.530 --> 02:49:59.800 line:15%
But you can sense it now.

3613
02:49:59.800 --> 02:50:01.480 line:15%
You know you're not terribly far off

3614
02:50:01.480 --> 02:50:03.880 line:15%
from a design completion.

3615
02:50:03.880 --> 02:50:05.820 line:15%
As to whether or not it will succeed, who knows,

3616
02:50:05.820 --> 02:50:08.640 line:15%
and what path'll get you, it'll take for you to get there.

3617
02:50:08.640 --> 02:50:10.130 line:15%
But that's about as far as you can

3618
02:50:10.130 --> 02:50:11.270 line:15%
reach with your morning attempt.

3619
02:50:11.270 --> 02:50:12.370 line:15%
Got it, great, good.

3620
02:50:13.330 --> 02:50:16.704 line:15%
Two more sessions and I'm back.

3621
02:50:16.704 --> 02:50:17.537 line:15%
(laughter)

3622
02:50:17.537 --> 02:50:18.980 line:15%
I'm calling it right now.
Oh my god.

3623
02:50:20.280 --> 02:50:21.790 line:15%
All right, so--
Okay, cool.

3624
02:50:21.790 --> 02:50:23.132 line:15%
The rest of you--
Are you

3625
02:50:23.132 --> 02:50:24.770 line:15%
going to call it, like, Nott's Proof?

3626
02:50:24.770 --> 02:50:26.700 line:15%
Name it after Nott's equation?

3627
02:50:26.700 --> 02:50:28.646 line:15%
Nott's Berry Farm.

3628
02:50:28.646 --> 02:50:30.930 line:15%
(laughter)

3629
02:50:30.930 --> 02:50:34.948 line:15%
So, you guys, have gathered your things.

3630
02:50:34.948 --> 02:50:35.781 line:15%
If there's anything else you want to try and accomplish

3631
02:50:35.781 --> 02:50:38.050 line:15%
in Rosohna, otherwise you can return to the Xhorhaus.

3632
02:50:39.374 --> 02:50:40.207 line:15%
It's good to return.

3633
02:50:40.207 --> 02:50:43.630 line:15%
I've got something with Caduceus because I went home.

3634
02:50:43.630 --> 02:50:45.410 line:15%
You want me to help you pack?

3635
02:50:45.410 --> 02:50:47.720 line:15%
Now, I'm just upstairs--
Do you need anything?

3636
02:50:47.720 --> 02:50:49.130 line:15%
Taking care of the trees, making sure

3637
02:50:49.130 --> 02:50:50.970 line:15%
the plants are all right, picking anything

3638
02:50:50.970 --> 02:50:52.590 line:15%
I want to bring with me.
I can help you.

3639
02:50:52.590 --> 02:50:54.180 line:15%
I am so fucking bored.

3640
02:50:55.380 --> 02:50:58.280 line:15%
Let me do something, please, for the love of gods.

3641
02:50:58.280 --> 02:50:59.480 line:15%
You're bored?
Yeah.

3642
02:51:01.515 --> 02:51:02.348 line:15%
Well, it's good, it builds character.

3643
02:51:02.348 --> 02:51:03.510 line:15%
Yeah, come on in.
Okay.

3644
02:51:04.580 --> 02:51:05.870 line:15%
Just going to garden for a little while.

3645
02:51:05.870 --> 02:51:07.830 line:15%
Garden.
So, you guys garden a bit.

3646
02:51:09.020 --> 02:51:11.040 line:15%
Go back in a few hours, see if the diamonds are ready.

3647
02:51:11.040 --> 02:51:13.660 line:15%
There is one diamond worth 300 gold

3648
02:51:15.470 --> 02:51:18.370 line:15%
and there is one worth 50 gold, smaller one.

3649
02:51:20.087 --> 02:51:21.640 line:15%
That doesn't help us.

3650
02:51:21.640 --> 02:51:24.470 line:15%
300.
I'll take the 300.

3651
02:51:24.470 --> 02:51:25.320 line:15%
Ooh, all right.

3652
02:51:26.711 --> 02:51:30.480 line:15%
And the smaller one, it's perfect for tiny jewels and gifts.

3653
02:51:30.480 --> 02:51:34.670 line:15%
It is really nice.
It is, ch-ch-ch-ch.

3654
02:51:34.670 --> 02:51:36.080 line:15%
50 gold, it's just like a,

3655
02:51:36.080 --> 02:51:38.930 line:15%
it's just like a, like a little one?

3656
02:51:38.930 --> 02:51:40.913 line:15%
Ah, do you want to, look at it.

3657
02:51:40.913 --> 02:51:42.170 line:15%
It's a little, like, it's a little one,

3658
02:51:42.170 --> 02:51:45.290 line:15%
little grain of diamond.
Wonder if I have,

3659
02:51:45.290 --> 02:51:46.580 line:15%
if only Jester were here, she could

3660
02:51:46.580 --> 02:51:48.360 line:15%

I'll take that one, too.
There you go.

350?

3663
02:51:53.030 --> 02:51:54.030 line:15%
All right.
Mmkay.

3664
02:51:56.370 --> 02:51:57.203 line:15%
Done.

It's dope.
But we should start

3701
02:53:43.480 --> 02:53:46.140 line:15%
heading down that way now--
Get the boat.

3702
02:53:46.140 --> 02:53:47.910 line:15%
In case we get waylaid.

3703

Oh, sweet.
What can that do?

3706

Can that, can that do, can that--

3707
02:53:53.320 --> 02:53:54.940 line:15%
Well, the 300 gold, that's, that can

3708
02:53:54.940 --> 02:53:56.580 line:15%

3709
02:53:56.580 --> 02:53:58.290 line:15%
So, good, the debt is repaid.

3710
02:53:58.290 --> 02:54:00.090 line:15%
Thank you for saving my life before.

Well, you don't, it's not a debt.

3712
02:54:03.690 --> 02:54:05.310 line:15%
Well, it is, and I know it's not

3713
02:54:05.310 --> 02:54:07.018 line:15%

I have a 350, so if you have a--

3717
02:54:13.940 --> 02:54:15.890 line:15%
I only have a 500.

3718
02:54:15.890 --> 02:54:18.090 line:15%
So, you need a three, take another 350, then.

3719
02:54:18.090 --> 02:54:19.700 line:15%
I'll take the 300 one.

3720
02:54:19.700 --> 02:54:21.270 line:15%
It's a 350 diamond, right?

3721
02:54:21.270 --> 02:54:22.620 line:15%
Or a 300--
300 gold

3722
02:54:22.620 --> 02:54:24.180 line:15%
diamond and then a 50 gold diamond.

3723
02:54:24.180 --> 02:54:26.030 line:15%
Oh, you don't need the other 50 gold diamond.

3724
02:54:26.030 --> 02:54:26.863 line:15%
We don't know what that does yet.

3725
02:54:26.863 --> 02:54:27.930 line:15%
I'm keeping the 50.
Yeah, okay.

3726
02:54:27.930 --> 02:54:29.360 line:15%
Oh come on, where is it?

3727
02:54:29.360 --> 02:54:30.830 line:15%
Unless you need it?
No.

3728
02:54:30.830 --> 02:54:31.950 line:15%
Yeah, that's fine.
Nott

(laughter)

3733
02:54:39.190 --> 02:54:41.140 line:15%
Like it?
It looks infected.

3734
02:54:41.140 --> 02:54:42.870 line:15%
I don't know.

3735
02:54:42.870 --> 02:54:45.920 line:15%
Oh no.
Tattooed, grill on.

3736
02:54:45.920 --> 02:54:46.970 line:15%
As you return, Caleb has been

3737
02:54:46.970 --> 02:54:50.180 line:15%
shut into his research facility

3738
02:54:50.180 --> 02:54:52.420 line:15%
and you can hear the clattering around.

3739
02:54:52.420 --> 02:54:55.850 line:15%
You are, like, in that mad place of, like,

3740
02:54:55.850 --> 02:54:57.600 line:15%
close but there's a blockage and you're, like,

3741
02:54:57.600 --> 02:54:58.760 line:15%
trying desperately to find

3742
02:54:58.760 --> 02:55:00.880 line:15%
a way around that, that inspiration block.

3743
02:55:02.251 --> 02:55:03.850 line:15%
Come here.
Ah!

3744
02:55:03.850 --> 02:55:05.720 line:15%
I pull her in and I start dancing around.

3745
02:55:05.720 --> 02:55:08.320 line:15%
Look at this, look at this, look here.

3746
02:55:08.320 --> 02:55:11.090 line:15%
I spent a couple of hours and then I ran out

3747
02:55:11.090 --> 02:55:13.280 line:15%
and I had to bring some components back.

3748
02:55:13.280 --> 02:55:18.190 line:15%
And I bypassed the hold that was keeping it from, you know,

3749
02:55:18.190 --> 02:55:20.840 line:15%
from locking in place and I can't do it yet

3750
02:55:20.840 --> 02:55:25.430 line:15%
but I think I know a way that I could know, but not yet.

3751
02:55:25.430 --> 02:55:27.165 line:15%
Does that make sense?
Doc, doc, doc.

3752
02:55:27.165 --> 02:55:28.840 line:15%
(laughter)

3753
02:55:28.840 --> 02:55:30.840 line:15%
Caleb, Caleb, were you eating those?

3754
02:55:30.840 --> 02:55:33.530 line:15%
Because that was a baking experiment gone horribly wrong.

3755
02:55:33.530 --> 02:55:35.860 line:15%
I used way too much sugar.
Those cookies are fantastic.

3756
02:55:35.860 --> 02:55:38.260 line:15%
More.
More of them.

3757
02:55:38.260 --> 02:55:40.023 line:15%
This is just.
Great Nott!

3758
02:55:40.023 --> 02:55:41.728 line:15%
(laughter)

3759
02:55:41.728 --> 02:55:43.978 line:15%
(clapping)

3760
02:55:46.058 --> 02:55:47.725 line:15%
That was good one.

3761
02:55:48.610 --> 02:55:50.710 line:15%
Yup, yup, go for it.

3762
02:55:50.710 --> 02:55:53.590 line:15%
Donut reward.
1.21 giga-Notts.

3763
02:55:53.590 --> 02:55:55.712 line:15%
(laughter)

3764
02:55:55.712 --> 02:55:56.545 line:15%
The Libyans?

3765
02:55:57.691 --> 02:56:00.199 line:15%
(laughter)

3766
02:56:00.199 --> 02:56:01.760 line:15%
All right.
This is amazing.

3767
02:56:01.760 --> 02:56:02.593 line:15%
Thank you, Caleb.

3768
02:56:02.593 --> 02:56:05.242 line:15%
But the end result is that I don't know how it works.

3769
02:56:05.242 --> 02:56:06.920 line:15%
Oh.
But I--

3770
02:56:08.008 --> 02:56:08.841 line:15%
All right.
You know how

3771
02:56:08.841 --> 02:56:09.674 line:15%
these things go.
No,

3772
02:56:09.674 --> 02:56:10.920 line:15%
but that's, this is progress.

3773
02:56:10.920 --> 02:56:13.240 line:15%
We're so close, you're so close.

3774
02:56:13.240 --> 02:56:14.380 line:15%
You are so close.

3775
02:56:16.920 --> 02:56:19.340 line:15%
Great.
That's what she said, ha.

3776
02:56:19.340 --> 02:56:21.702 line:15%
Ha ha ha.
I don't get it.

3777
02:56:21.702 --> 02:56:23.726 line:15%
This is pretty important--
Is it?

3778
02:56:23.726 --> 02:56:27.700 line:15%
Walk out here with me.
Ugh.

3779
02:56:27.700 --> 02:56:28.800 line:15%
Cup her by the face.

3780
02:56:30.325 --> 02:56:32.670 line:15%
A little bit longer, a little bit longer,

3781
02:56:32.670 --> 02:56:36.680 line:15%
maybe Essek, he'll help me, we will have it.

3782
02:56:36.680 --> 02:56:38.980 line:15%
All right, all right.
Do you believe me?

3783
02:56:38.980 --> 02:56:40.950 line:15%
Of course I believe you, yes.

3784
02:56:40.950 --> 02:56:42.812 line:15%
Good.
Thank you.

3785
02:56:42.812 --> 02:56:43.645 line:15%
(whooshing)

3786
02:56:43.645 --> 02:56:45.890 line:15%
Oh.
Shuts himself in.

3787
02:56:45.890 --> 02:56:47.550 line:15%
Wait.
We have, oh.

3788
02:56:47.550 --> 02:56:51.100 line:15%
Ah, we were going to go.
Oh yeah, but we're leaving.

3789
02:56:51.100 --> 02:56:53.010 line:15%
I need an hour!
Okay.

3790
02:56:53.010 --> 02:56:54.570 line:15%
Ooh, ooh, in an hour.

3791
02:56:54.570 --> 02:56:56.890 line:15%
I'm just going to run out to the store

3792
02:56:56.890 --> 02:56:58.210 line:15%
and see if I can find somewhere where

3793
02:56:58.210 --> 02:57:00.352 line:15%
I can buy, like, a bunch of green cloaks. (laughs)

3794
02:57:00.352 --> 02:57:02.510 line:15%
(laughter)

3795
02:57:02.510 --> 02:57:03.343 line:15%
Sure.

3796
02:57:03.343 --> 02:57:04.770 line:15%
How many green cloaks do you want to buy?

3797
02:57:04.770 --> 02:57:06.300 line:15%
Like, as many as they have.

3798
02:57:06.300 --> 02:57:09.638 line:15%
Every green cloak in the kingdom.

3799
02:57:09.638 --> 02:57:11.907 line:15%
(talking over each other)
(laughter)

3800
02:57:11.907 --> 02:57:13.097 line:15%
Army, navy surplus.

3801
02:57:13.097 --> 02:57:13.968 line:15%
I don't know if it's like a store

3802
02:57:13.968 --> 02:57:16.323 line:15%
where it's a bunch of like, you know when you go to

3803
02:57:16.323 --> 02:57:17.870 line:15%
the ren faire and there's, like, all a bunch of--

3804
02:57:17.870 --> 02:57:18.820 line:15%
The green cloak store?

3805
02:57:18.820 --> 02:57:19.880 line:15%
Yeah, the green cloak section.

3806
02:57:19.880 --> 02:57:21.266 line:15%
Yeah, okay.

3807
02:57:21.266 --> 02:57:22.897 line:15%
I'll say--

3808
02:57:22.897 --> 02:57:23.730 line:15%
(laughter)

3809
02:57:23.730 --> 02:57:25.740 line:15%
Or just a bunch of green fabric, I can do that too.

3810
02:57:25.740 --> 02:57:27.140 line:15%
Green fabric is easier.

3811
02:57:27.140 --> 02:57:30.700 line:15%
Cloaks, you can find a dozen, 12 green cloaks

3812
02:57:30.700 --> 02:57:33.800 line:15%
of slightly varying shades, but all green.

3813
02:57:36.120 --> 02:57:37.620 line:15%
Some that--
In plastic bags

3814
02:57:37.620 --> 02:57:40.980 line:15%
that are, like, very iffy.
Yeah, like, "Satin?"

3815
02:57:44.828 --> 02:57:45.798 line:15%
They have an ad on them.

3816
02:57:45.798 --> 02:57:47.648 line:15%
For the 12 of them, it'll cost you,

3817
02:57:48.792 --> 02:57:52.460 line:15%
we'll say 5 gold pieces all together.

3818
02:57:52.460 --> 02:57:54.930 line:15%
Oh, awesome.
And for additional material.

3819
02:57:54.930 --> 02:57:57.020 line:15%
They're not super fancy cloaks, but they're

3820
02:57:57.020 --> 02:57:59.640 line:15%
decent enough to still cost, you know, a fair sum.

3821
02:58:00.840 --> 02:58:03.570 line:15%
Lord of the Rings cloak.
Yeah, pretty much.

3822
02:58:03.570 --> 02:58:05.160 line:15%
Yup, it's from Party City.

3823
02:58:06.959 --> 02:58:08.350 line:15%
(laughter)

3824
02:58:08.350 --> 02:58:10.390 line:15%
Material, you could purchase enough material

3825
02:58:10.390 --> 02:58:13.790 line:15%
for 20 cloaks if you'd like and that'll run you,

3826
02:58:13.790 --> 02:58:17.420 line:15%
just material-wise, about an additional 6 gold.

3827
02:58:17.420 --> 02:58:20.637 line:15%
You could make them.
Okay.

3828
02:58:20.637 --> 02:58:23.810 line:15%
And that all fabric will fit in my haversack?

3829
02:58:23.810 --> 02:58:24.987 line:15%
It will but it would push

3830
02:58:24.987 --> 02:58:26.690 line:15%
the limits of one of the pouches.

3831
02:58:29.370 --> 02:58:30.203 line:15%
There's some stuff in there.

3832
02:58:30.203 --> 02:58:32.050 line:15%
You don't need 20 acolytes, you only need 12.

3833
02:58:33.780 --> 02:58:34.890 line:15%
Well.
It's very biblical.

3834
02:58:34.890 --> 02:58:36.950 line:15%
Of varying sizes.
In fact, for the haversack,

3835
02:58:36.950 --> 02:58:37.860 line:15%
it might be a little tough because

3836
02:58:37.860 --> 02:58:40.850 line:15%
the bolts are pretty, pretty long and the haversack

3837
02:58:40.850 --> 02:58:42.810 line:15%
has limitations on the pocket size.

3838
02:58:42.810 --> 02:58:44.050 line:15%
Might be something that you have to

3839
02:58:44.050 --> 02:58:45.658 line:15%
consider with the bag of holding.

3840
02:58:45.658 --> 02:58:47.840 line:15%
Okay, I can just carry them.

3841
02:58:47.840 --> 02:58:49.630 line:15%
Okay well, I'm just going to get the additional

3842
02:58:49.630 --> 02:58:52.950 line:15%
6 gold worth of fabric, just in case.

3843
02:58:52.950 --> 02:58:55.140 line:15%
So, we'll say, like, four bolts of green fabric

3844
02:58:55.140 --> 02:58:57.550 line:15%
is what you can put down.
Oh my god.

3845
02:58:57.550 --> 02:58:59.970 line:15%
I hate going to the fabric district, it's too much.

3846
02:58:59.970 --> 02:59:01.900 line:15%
You love going to the fabric district.

3847
02:59:01.900 --> 02:59:05.235 line:15%
I like going to the clothing, well, yeah.

3848
02:59:05.235 --> 02:59:06.068 line:15%
(laughter)

3849
02:59:06.068 --> 02:59:06.901 line:15%
Raw bolts, though.

3850
02:59:07.908 --> 02:59:09.220 line:15%
Raw bolts.
Raw bolts, it's just like--

3851
02:59:09.220 --> 02:59:10.200 line:15%
I like going to the fabric district.

3852
02:59:10.200 --> 02:59:12.350 line:15%
Do you have enough gold?
No, no, I do.

3853
02:59:14.211 --> 02:59:16.552 line:15%
Wait, okay, but platinum is

3854
02:59:16.552 --> 02:59:18.630 line:15%
equals 10 gold.
Correct.

3855
02:59:19.943 --> 02:59:22.520 line:15%
I thought if I just subtracted the gold,

3856
02:59:22.520 --> 02:59:25.500 line:15%
it would automatically make my platinum go down.

3857
02:59:25.500 --> 02:59:26.490 line:15%
You can--
Got to be

3858
02:59:26.490 --> 02:59:28.450 line:15%
careful, though.
You can get change, right?

3859
02:59:28.450 --> 02:59:29.780 line:15%
That's what I thought.

3860
02:59:29.780 --> 02:59:32.220 line:15%
I mean, with the seller.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

3861
02:59:32.220 --> 02:59:34.510 line:15%
What's the platinum to gold exchange rate in Exandria--

3862
02:59:34.510 --> 02:59:37.540 line:15%
10 gold per platinum.
Changes approved per day,

3863
02:59:37.540 --> 02:59:39.150 line:15%
fluctuates.
10.01--

3864
02:59:40.044 --> 02:59:41.320 line:15%
You have to keep tabs on that.

3865
02:59:41.320 --> 02:59:43.540 line:15%
So, if I subtract one platinum, I can add 100 gold.

3866
02:59:43.540 --> 02:59:46.060 line:15%
10 gold.
10 gold for one platinum.

3867
02:59:46.060 --> 02:59:47.230 line:15%
10 gold, right.

3868
02:59:47.230 --> 02:59:48.640 line:15%
Okay, so, okay, so that's--

3869
02:59:50.441 --> 02:59:51.970 line:15%
So, one platinum and one gold will pay for both

3870
02:59:51.970 --> 02:59:54.947 line:15%
the cloaks and the bolt.
Okay.

3871
02:59:54.947 --> 02:59:57.050 line:15%
(yawning)

3872
02:59:57.050 --> 02:59:58.300 line:15%
Sugar.
That is with nine gold.

3873
02:59:58.300 --> 02:59:59.610 line:15%
Okay, got it.

3874
03:00:01.820 --> 03:00:04.020 line:15%
All right.
All right, hour's up, Cay.

3875
03:00:04.020 --> 03:00:05.550 line:15%
We're leaving.
Okay.

3876
03:00:05.550 --> 03:00:06.383 line:15%
I, real quick.

3877
03:00:07.340 --> 03:00:10.700 line:15%
I want to go up to my room just alone.

3878
03:00:10.700 --> 03:00:11.533 line:15%
Okay.

3879
03:00:14.082 --> 03:00:15.770 line:15%
I'm going to close the door, make sure

3880
03:00:15.770 --> 03:00:18.380 line:15%
that it's locked--
Mm-hmm.

3881
03:00:19.760 --> 03:00:24.210 line:15%
And am I able to take off the breastplate?

3882
03:00:25.404 --> 03:00:26.827 line:15%
Ooh.
Uh, yeah, you are.

3883
03:00:28.287 --> 03:00:30.160 line:15%
It takes a little bit to do it yourself,

3884
03:00:30.160 --> 03:00:31.960 line:15%
but like, five minutes to pull off.

3885
03:00:32.830 --> 03:00:33.663 line:15%
Okay.

3886
03:00:38.677 --> 03:00:40.844 line:15%
(sighing)

3887
03:00:42.220 --> 03:00:44.820 line:15%
I'm going to put it back on.
Okay.

3888
03:00:47.820 --> 03:00:50.353 line:15%
Then I go downstairs.
Okay.

3889
03:00:50.353 --> 03:00:51.953 line:15%
Did it say Crayola underneath?

3890
03:00:52.800 --> 03:00:53.633 line:15%
No?
No.

3891
03:00:55.616 --> 03:00:56.917 line:15%
All right, so whatta you guys want to do?

3892
03:00:56.917 --> 03:00:57.750 line:15%
(sighing)

3893
03:00:57.750 --> 03:01:00.970 line:15%
We are preparing to go for a quest.

3894
03:01:00.970 --> 03:01:04.800 line:15%
Yeah.
Caduceus, where do we go?

3895
03:01:04.800 --> 03:01:05.700 line:15%
Where's the map?

3896
03:01:06.860 --> 03:01:09.080 line:15%
There's no reason to check back into the Empire, right?

3897
03:01:09.080 --> 03:01:12.040 line:15%
We're good for a bit.
Yeah, four weeks.

3898
03:01:12.040 --> 03:01:13.490 line:15%
All right.
Did you respond to them?

3899
03:01:13.490 --> 03:01:14.860 line:15%
Oh, I should respond.

3900
03:01:14.860 --> 03:01:16.510 line:15%
I'm going to send a message back.

3901
03:01:16.510 --> 03:01:19.190 line:15%
Oh, but I could have responded to his messages.

3902
03:01:19.190 --> 03:01:23.990 line:15%
So, yes I would've done that and said, "Cool, good to know.

3903
03:01:23.990 --> 03:01:25.190 line:15%
"Everything's good here.

3904
03:01:26.590 --> 03:01:30.370 line:15%
"We are doing what you said and we'll let them know

3905
03:01:30.370 --> 03:01:32.730 line:15%
"about the meet up and it's all good to go."

3906
03:01:32.730 --> 03:01:33.563 line:15%
Mmkay.

3907
03:01:35.140 --> 03:01:36.210 line:15%
Make an intelligence check, Caleb.

3908
03:01:36.210 --> 03:01:39.790 line:15%
Oh shit.
Whitedawn Lagoon?

3909
03:01:42.310 --> 03:01:44.560 line:15%
I roll terrible in this campaign, 13 total.

3910
03:01:44.560 --> 03:01:45.720 line:15%
Okay.
Rolled a three.

3911
03:01:47.070 --> 03:01:47.903 line:15%
Um.

3912
03:01:48.862 --> 03:01:51.750 line:15%
Oh ho ho boy.
Hm.

3913
03:01:51.750 --> 03:01:52.890 line:15%
Oh, you might have the map.

3914
03:01:52.890 --> 03:01:54.800 line:15%
Which map, I'm trying to find the right map.

3915
03:01:55.964 --> 03:01:56.797 line:15%
The Whitedawn Lagoon is at the

3916
03:01:56.797 --> 03:01:57.630 line:15%
very, very bottom of that map.

3917
03:01:57.630 --> 03:01:58.740 line:15%
Yeah, Whitedawn Lagoon.
Right here--

3918
03:01:58.740 --> 03:02:01.590 line:15%
It is a challenge to get to from where you are.

3919
03:02:02.470 --> 03:02:04.050 line:15%
But?
So you have to figure out

3920
03:02:04.050 --> 03:02:06.060 line:15%
what your, if that's where you're heading next,

3921
03:02:06.060 --> 03:02:08.990 line:15%
then consider your course of travel.

3922
03:02:11.340 --> 03:02:14.069 line:15%
Essek! (laughs)

3923
03:02:14.069 --> 03:02:17.360 line:15%
We could--
This is in, in the Dynasty?

3924
03:02:17.360 --> 03:02:19.560 line:15%
Yeah, so it's south of where we are right now.

3925
03:02:19.560 --> 03:02:22.520 line:15%
So, would it be best to leave from

3926
03:02:22.520 --> 03:02:26.330 line:15%
the Menagerie Coast and take the boat, perhaps?

3927
03:02:26.330 --> 03:02:27.163 line:15%
I mean, maybe.

3928
03:02:28.680 --> 03:02:30.770 line:15%
Oh wow.
It's not a so good idea.

3929
03:02:30.770 --> 03:02:33.438 line:15%
Instead of going across land?

3930
03:02:33.438 --> 03:02:35.844 line:15%
Does that connect?
Yeah.

3931
03:02:35.844 --> 03:02:39.020 line:15%
If you go from Nicodranas, you'd head south

3932
03:02:40.164 --> 03:02:41.840 line:15%
past Rumblecusp, Urukayxl,

3933
03:02:41.840 --> 03:02:44.900 line:15%
and then you go, continue to go west, and you'll

3934
03:02:44.900 --> 03:02:46.010 line:15%
eventually get there.
We could do a fly by

3935
03:02:46.010 --> 03:02:47.963 line:15%
of where the con's going to be.
But it'll take--

3936
03:02:47.963 --> 03:02:50.110 line:15%
West?
It'll take awhile via ship.

3937
03:02:50.110 --> 03:02:52.480 line:15%
Specifically--
Longer?

3938
03:02:52.480 --> 03:02:55.270 line:15%
If you're going a fast pace, oh actually no,

3939
03:02:55.270 --> 03:02:57.261 line:15%
it's just a regular pace on ship there,

3940
03:02:57.261 --> 03:02:59.240 line:15%
(paper rustling)

3941
03:02:59.240 --> 03:03:02.630 line:15%
about four miles an hour, well if you're a longship,

3942
03:03:02.630 --> 03:03:03.790 line:15%
about three miles an hour, actually,

3943
03:03:03.790 --> 03:03:05.590 line:15%
because you're not a galley, you're a longship.

3944
03:03:05.590 --> 03:03:07.670 line:15%
So, three miles an hour is what you're

3945
03:03:07.670 --> 03:03:11.720 line:15%
looking to be traveling at and the distance around is,

3946
03:03:13.444 --> 03:03:14.798 line:15%
I'll have to check what the--

3947
03:03:14.798 --> 03:03:15.631 line:15%
I think so.
Think thought.

3948
03:03:15.631 --> 03:03:18.840 line:15%
It's going to be a few hundred miles.

3949
03:03:18.840 --> 03:03:20.420 line:15%
How, huh?
Yeah.

3950
03:03:20.420 --> 03:03:21.810 line:15%
A few hundred miles.
Maybe

3951
03:03:21.810 --> 03:03:24.750 line:15%
we should travel magically.
But we

3952
03:03:24.750 --> 03:03:27.080 line:15%
still have to get out boat there.

3953
03:03:27.080 --> 03:03:29.040 line:15%
Yeah, but we can do that in a--

3954
03:03:29.040 --> 03:03:32.090 line:15%
No, we have to tell Orly to get our boat to meet us

3955
03:03:32.090 --> 03:03:35.393 line:15%
if we're going to and it'll still take him--

3956
03:03:35.393 --> 03:03:37.150 line:15%
Well, we should send him now.

3957
03:03:37.150 --> 03:03:39.160 line:15%
We should at least let Orly know

3958
03:03:39.160 --> 03:03:40.460 line:15%
where he needs to be when.

3959
03:03:41.660 --> 03:03:43.390 line:15%
So where should I tell him to meet us?

3960
03:03:43.390 --> 03:03:46.360 line:15%
Well, probably, probably board at the Menagerie Coast

3961
03:03:46.360 --> 03:03:48.560 line:15%
to head to where the meetings going to be,

3962
03:03:48.560 --> 03:03:52.360 line:15%
so however long with a little time extra.

3963
03:03:52.360 --> 03:03:53.660 line:15%
So tell him to meet us at the

3964
03:03:53.660 --> 03:03:55.070 line:15%
Menagerie Coast in three weeks?

3965
03:03:55.070 --> 03:03:57.050 line:15%
And then we just bamf to Menagerie Coast?

3966
03:03:57.050 --> 03:03:59.950 line:15%
I mean, ideally, it'd be Essek to where we need to go,

3967
03:03:59.950 --> 03:04:01.430 line:15%
Caleb to the Menagerie Coast.

3968
03:04:03.990 --> 03:04:05.240 line:15%
Where are we right now?

3969
03:04:06.280 --> 03:04:07.470 line:15%
Then the boat to wherever we need to go.

3970
03:04:07.470 --> 03:04:09.430 line:15%
But then, I mean, he said the boat is going to take,

3971
03:04:09.430 --> 03:04:13.820 line:15%
to the meetup point, the boat will take a few hundred miles?

3972
03:04:13.820 --> 03:04:15.470 line:15%
To the Lucidian Ocean, which is

3973
03:04:16.420 --> 03:04:19.710 line:15%
a hundred, a hundred miles away?

3974
03:04:19.710 --> 03:04:21.640 line:15%
The Menagerie Coast should have a--

3975
03:04:23.260 --> 03:04:26.130 line:15%
Is, it's really not going to be quicker

3976
03:04:26.130 --> 03:04:29.900 line:15%
to go by boat than to walk?

3977
03:04:29.900 --> 03:04:33.500 line:15%
Or ride.
We got to get horses?

3978
03:04:33.500 --> 03:04:35.010 line:15%
Can you go ahead and get my map out?

3979
03:04:35.010 --> 03:04:36.970 line:15%
Going to double check.
Horses would be better.

3980
03:04:36.970 --> 03:04:38.240 line:15%
No, but so where we're going right now

3981
03:04:38.240 --> 03:04:40.660 line:15%
is not where the Traveler Con is.

3982
03:04:40.660 --> 03:04:44.380 line:15%
No, we're going to Caduceus' place first.

3983
03:04:44.380 --> 03:04:47.010 line:15%
Yes, so we don't need the boat there at all.

3984
03:04:47.010 --> 03:04:49.530 line:15%
No, but we just need to tell the boat where to meet us

3985
03:04:49.530 --> 03:04:50.960 line:15%
because it's going to take a while

3986
03:04:50.960 --> 03:04:53.211 line:15%
from wherever we go to get to the meet up,

3987
03:04:53.211 --> 03:04:54.690 line:15%
right?
Yeah.

3988
03:04:54.690 --> 03:04:57.540 line:15%
Unless we, because where's, but we don't know

3989
03:04:57.540 --> 03:04:59.300 line:15%
where the meet up point is yet, right?

3990
03:04:59.300 --> 03:05:00.640 line:15%
That's part of the problem.

3991
03:05:00.640 --> 03:05:01.820 line:15%
But I thought we did, I thought he just

3992
03:05:01.820 --> 03:05:03.170 line:15%
told me where the meet up point was.

3993
03:05:03.170 --> 03:05:07.840 line:15%
Well, it was off of, we're meeting in the Menagerie,

3994
03:05:07.840 --> 03:05:10.920 line:15%
in Nicodranas and then setting port from Nicodranas,

3995
03:05:10.920 --> 03:05:11.910 line:15%
is that's what happening?

3996
03:05:11.910 --> 03:05:14.900 line:15%
Do we, Matt, DM, oh, you're already calculating something.

3997
03:05:14.900 --> 03:05:16.230 line:15%
What is that?
What is your question?

3998
03:05:16.230 --> 03:05:18.370 line:15%
I can't remember, did we name a specific place

3999
03:05:18.370 --> 03:05:20.100 line:15%
or just a region at this point?

4000
03:05:20.100 --> 03:05:25.100 line:15%
You named a center point between Nicodranas

4001
03:05:25.720 --> 03:05:29.420 line:15%
and the Whitedawn Lagoon.
To be determined?

4002
03:05:29.420 --> 03:05:32.820 line:15%
It is to be determined by, and they're going to notify you

4003
03:05:32.820 --> 03:05:34.930 line:15%
as soon as they find out the specifics there.

4004
03:05:34.930 --> 03:05:37.870 line:15%
There is no landfall, it is to be at sea on a ship.

4005
03:05:37.870 --> 03:05:40.050 line:15%
Okay.
It's going to be

4006
03:05:40.050 --> 03:05:42.360 line:15%
just south of the southern-most portion of

4007
03:05:42.360 --> 03:05:46.210 line:15%
the Ashkeeper Peaks is generally where it's going to be.

4008
03:05:46.210 --> 03:05:49.120 line:15%
This is also where--
Which is about, by ship,

4009
03:05:50.914 --> 03:05:54.030 line:15%
it's about 300 miles ride from Nicodranas

4010
03:05:54.030 --> 03:05:57.510 line:15%
via red standard ship, which is why it's taking four weeks

4011
03:05:57.510 --> 03:05:59.920 line:15%
to arrange this based on the location you guys chose.

4012
03:05:59.920 --> 03:06:01.300 line:15%
All the naval forces of both sides

4013
03:06:01.300 --> 03:06:03.970 line:15%
are going to be present here, are all preparing,

4014
03:06:03.970 --> 03:06:05.200 line:15%
getting things ready, and then doing

4015
03:06:05.200 --> 03:06:07.960 line:15%
an extended travel there, hence why it's taking

4016
03:06:07.960 --> 03:06:09.880 line:15%
four weeks before this arrangement happens.

4017
03:06:09.880 --> 03:06:11.450 line:15%
Okay.
So.

4018
03:06:13.980 --> 03:06:15.590 line:15%
That is where it stands.
Is it best--

4019
03:06:15.590 --> 03:06:17.760 line:15%
To the Whitedawn Lagoon from Nicodranas,

4020
03:06:19.059 --> 03:06:23.270 line:15%
it's going to be roughly 450 miles travel.

4021
03:06:23.270 --> 03:06:28.270 line:15%
What's our closest point of comfortable teleportation

4022
03:06:28.270 --> 03:06:30.670 line:15%
with what we have now from the Whitedawn Lagoon?

4023
03:06:31.610 --> 03:06:35.400 line:15%
You're looking at either Nicodranas or Asarius.

4024
03:06:35.400 --> 03:06:37.800 line:15%
Where is Asarius?
It's north of Nicodranas.

4025
03:06:38.818 --> 03:06:39.651 line:15%
Right?

4026
03:06:39.651 --> 03:06:40.607 line:15%
Where is it?

4027
03:06:40.607 --> 03:06:41.941 line:15%
(laughter)

4028
03:06:41.941 --> 03:06:43.686 line:15%
I love that we all have this map.

4029
03:06:43.686 --> 03:06:45.870 line:15%
That's the Empire over there.

4030
03:06:45.870 --> 03:06:47.670 line:15%
Yeah, the Empire map, it's not on there.

4031
03:06:47.670 --> 03:06:51.560 line:15%
But, yeah. (laughs)
Is it on Xhorhas?

4032
03:06:51.560 --> 03:06:53.010 line:15%
Asarius?
Asarius is

4033
03:06:53.010 --> 03:06:54.250 line:15%
on the Xhorhas map, yes.

4034
03:06:54.250 --> 03:06:57.220 line:15%
It is in the center, center north area.

4035
03:06:58.230 --> 03:07:00.020 line:15%
So, we want to travel south and we want our boat

4036
03:07:00.020 --> 03:07:02.750 line:15%
to start traveling now to pick us up just off the,

4037
03:07:04.374 --> 03:07:05.207 line:15%
on the coast underneath where we're going

4038
03:07:05.207 --> 03:07:07.200 line:15%
for Cad's shizznit.
Because we

4039
03:07:07.200 --> 03:07:09.940 line:15%
need to be where for you, here?

4040
03:07:09.940 --> 03:07:11.440 line:15%
No, for you.

4041
03:07:11.440 --> 03:07:13.140 line:15%
Oh, it is the lagoon.
Yeah, it's the

4042
03:07:13.140 --> 03:07:14.410 line:15%
Whitedawn Lagoon is where we're going.

4043
03:07:14.410 --> 03:07:15.777 line:15%
Well, shit.
So, we'll

4044
03:07:15.777 --> 03:07:17.710 line:15%
send Orly to the southern tip--

4045
03:07:17.710 --> 03:07:19.140 line:15%
Of the Whitedawn Lagoon.
Yeah.

4046
03:07:19.140 --> 03:07:20.890 line:15%
Okay, I'm going to--
You have, you have,

4047
03:07:20.890 --> 03:07:22.010 line:15%
that's for your teleportation as well.

4048
03:07:22.010 --> 03:07:23.800 line:15%
You guys have been to the Lotusden Greenwood,

4049
03:07:23.800 --> 03:07:25.570 line:15%
that is where you battled--

4050
03:07:25.570 --> 03:07:27.120 line:15%
Oh yeah, we could bamf there.

4051
03:07:28.210 --> 03:07:30.140 line:15%
We don't have, we can go there?

4052
03:07:30.140 --> 03:07:31.870 line:15%
But Essek could take us.
You do not have the thing.

4053
03:07:31.870 --> 03:07:33.000 line:15%
Essek took you there last time.

4054
03:07:33.000 --> 03:07:34.160 line:15%
Yeah.

4055
03:07:34.160 --> 03:07:36.350 line:15%
Say that, what was that?
Essek took you guys there

4056
03:07:36.350 --> 03:07:37.903 line:15%
last time.
Took us there last time.

4057
03:07:37.903 --> 03:07:39.550 line:15%
He likes us now, he could take us.

4058
03:07:39.550 --> 03:07:40.950 line:15%
There's a, there's a pass.

4059
03:07:41.880 --> 03:07:45.500 line:15%
The Lagoon is where we chased Yasha and Obann, right?

4060
03:07:45.500 --> 03:07:47.650 line:15%
Yeah, okay, okay.

4061
03:07:47.650 --> 03:07:51.330 line:15%
Yeah, we chased you.
Yeah, that's right.

4062
03:07:53.340 --> 03:07:56.240 line:15%
Asarius is right here.
That's really far.

4063
03:07:57.139 --> 03:07:57.972 line:15%
I mean--

4064
03:07:57.972 --> 03:07:59.620 line:15%
Yeah, let's get Essek and go by magic.

4065
03:07:59.620 --> 03:08:00.580 line:15%
This is crazy.

4066
03:08:00.580 --> 03:08:01.980 line:15%
Let's go to his house, let's go to his house.

4067
03:08:01.980 --> 03:08:03.330 line:15%
Show us where his house is.

4068
03:08:05.125 --> 03:08:06.610 line:15%
Okay, we can do that.
Oh boy.

4069
03:08:06.610 --> 03:08:07.443 line:15%
Are we ready to go?

4070
03:08:07.443 --> 03:08:09.210 line:15%
Let's go.
Yup, let's go.

4071
03:08:09.210 --> 03:08:10.043 line:15%
Bye.
All right.

4072
03:08:10.043 --> 03:08:10.880 line:15%
So, you're gathering all your materials

4073
03:08:10.880 --> 03:08:11.790 line:15%
and getting ready to move?

4074
03:08:11.790 --> 03:08:13.589 line:15%
We're splitting.
Okay.

4075
03:08:13.589 --> 03:08:14.422 line:15%
Is that cool, everybody?
Yeah.

4076
03:08:14.422 --> 03:08:16.370 line:15%
Okay, Beauregard and Caleb will lead

4077
03:08:16.370 --> 03:08:18.190 line:15%
the group over to Essek's towers.

4078
03:08:18.190 --> 03:08:20.458 line:15%
Bamfing straight to the lagoon.

4079
03:08:20.458 --> 03:08:21.291 line:15%
All right.
If we can.

4080
03:08:21.291 --> 03:08:22.160 line:15%
Okay.

4081
03:08:22.160 --> 03:08:24.070 line:15%
You pack up your materials and make your way across

4082
03:08:24.070 --> 03:08:29.070 line:15%
the neighborhood to the outside of Essek's property.

4083
03:08:29.110 --> 03:08:30.820 line:15%
For most of you, aside from the two of you,

4084
03:08:30.820 --> 03:08:33.310 line:15%
this is your first time seeing it and it's,

4085
03:08:33.310 --> 03:08:35.890 line:15%
in its unique splendor, presented before you.

4086
03:08:36.940 --> 03:08:39.690 line:15%
You come to the front gate, the gate is closed.

4087
03:08:41.590 --> 03:08:43.190 line:15%
Should we--
I'll send him a message.

4088
03:08:43.190 --> 03:08:44.580 line:15%
Yeah, I'll send him a message.

4089
03:08:46.095 --> 03:08:48.440 line:15%
"Hey Essek, we're out front of your house.

4090
03:08:49.820 --> 03:08:52.030 line:15%
"We're just wondering if you would have breakfast

4091
03:08:52.030 --> 03:08:54.580 line:15%
"with us in your house and also take us somewhere."

4092
03:08:56.370 --> 03:08:58.370 line:15%
I just start waving towards the house.

4093
03:08:59.380 --> 03:09:01.010 line:15%
That doesn't go through in the message.

4094
03:09:01.010 --> 03:09:02.850 line:15%
He might, what if he peeks out?

4095
03:09:02.850 --> 03:09:06.110 line:15%
He comes back, "I was wondering whether or not

4096
03:09:06.110 --> 03:09:07.810 line:15%
"you were going to stop by today."

4097
03:09:09.810 --> 03:09:11.060 line:15%
There's a brief pause and you see,

4098
03:09:11.060 --> 03:09:12.670 line:15%
on one of the walkways from one of the towers,

4099
03:09:12.670 --> 03:09:14.840 line:15%
you see a figure step out and look over.

4100
03:09:14.840 --> 03:09:15.673 line:15%
Ha, see, see?

4101
03:09:15.673 --> 03:09:17.240 line:15%
Hey!
Yeah, of course.

4102
03:09:17.240 --> 03:09:20.000 line:15%
Gives a nod and continues to the next tower

4103
03:09:20.000 --> 03:09:22.300 line:15%
and then eventually emerges from below.

4104
03:09:22.300 --> 03:09:24.104 line:15%
Essek approaches, waves a hand, and the gate

4105
03:09:24.104 --> 03:09:26.080 line:15%
(makes creaking noise) opens and lets you guys in.

4106
03:09:26.080 --> 03:09:27.310 line:15%
Yay.

4107
03:09:28.870 --> 03:09:31.810 line:15%
Come, come, allow me to--
Sorry we are late.

4108
03:09:31.810 --> 03:09:32.650 line:15%
Oh, it is all right.

4109
03:09:32.650 --> 03:09:35.540 line:15%
I do have some food prepared as a

4110
03:09:35.540 --> 03:09:38.090 line:15%
return favor for the delicious dinner.

4111
03:09:38.090 --> 03:09:39.090 line:15%
Thank you, Caduceus.

4112
03:09:40.130 --> 03:09:41.850 line:15%
This way, please.
Yay.

4113
03:09:43.290 --> 03:09:46.883 line:15%
Leads you into this what appears to be

4114
03:09:46.883 --> 03:09:49.700 line:15%
a foyer-ish type chamber with, you know, nice

4115
03:09:49.700 --> 03:09:51.490 line:15%
furniture curved on the edges of it.

4116
03:09:51.490 --> 03:09:55.090 line:15%
The smell, when you come inside, is very

4117
03:09:56.267 --> 03:09:59.390 line:15%
(snaps) strangely herbal, like it has a very

4118
03:09:59.390 --> 03:10:02.780 line:15%
earthy, herbal smell to the air there with a bit of,

4119
03:10:04.830 --> 03:10:08.680 line:15%
only thing I describe is like a hint of electrical fire,

4120
03:10:08.680 --> 03:10:10.380 line:15%
something like that sort of smell.

4121
03:10:12.838 --> 03:10:14.900 line:15%
But there are these beautiful almost glass-like stairs

4122
03:10:14.900 --> 03:10:17.540 line:15%
that emerge from the wall that don't have

4123
03:10:18.942 --> 03:10:21.290 line:15%
a hard-set connecting pivot, they're just

4124
03:10:21.290 --> 03:10:24.180 line:15%
free-floating, it seems, outside of the stone wall

4125
03:10:24.180 --> 03:10:25.760 line:15%
and they're just translucent steps

4126
03:10:25.760 --> 03:10:28.310 line:15%
that lead up the spiral of the tower you're in.

4127
03:10:29.150 --> 03:10:31.390 line:15%
Ultra modernist, got to say.

4128
03:10:31.390 --> 03:10:33.513 line:15%
Yeah. (laughs)

4129
03:10:33.513 --> 03:10:36.930 line:15%
And he, "Allow me to take care of this for you."

4130
03:10:36.930 --> 03:10:38.660 line:15%
And he waves his hand for a second

4131
03:10:38.660 --> 03:10:40.945 line:15%
and you watch as the chairs, the furniture

4132
03:10:40.945 --> 03:10:41.778 line:15%
(scraping)

4133
03:10:41.778 --> 03:10:43.140 line:15%
scoots from the edges into the center,

4134
03:10:43.140 --> 03:10:46.580 line:15%
forming a little seating area, table scoots in.

4135
03:10:46.580 --> 03:10:47.630 line:15%
Caleb, you should learn to do that.

4136
03:10:47.630 --> 03:10:48.880 line:15%
That's really impressive.

4137
03:10:50.670 --> 03:10:52.440 line:15%
I can do an approximation of it

4138
03:10:52.440 --> 03:10:54.680 line:15%
but it's a little more herky jerky than that.

4139
03:10:54.680 --> 03:10:56.350 line:15%
Big cat paw pushes it over.

4140
03:10:56.350 --> 03:10:57.800 line:15%
Oh, that's true, yeah.

4141
03:10:57.800 --> 03:10:59.250 line:15%
Eventually, he brings some food

4142
03:10:59.250 --> 03:11:00.350 line:15%
and sits you all down.

4143
03:11:02.500 --> 03:11:03.333 line:15%
"So,

4144
03:11:05.896 --> 03:11:07.260 line:15%
"how do I do this?

4145
03:11:07.260 --> 03:11:10.760 line:15%
"How was your day?"
Really great so far.

4146
03:11:10.760 --> 03:11:14.010 line:15%
We did some shopping, some errands, we're going on a trip.

4147
03:11:16.020 --> 03:11:18.990 line:15%
We've arranged, we've received word

4148
03:11:18.990 --> 03:11:21.680 line:15%
of some of the details of this meeting.

4149
03:11:21.680 --> 03:11:26.270 line:15%
Yeah, they found Vence.
Ah, that is good news.

4150
03:11:26.270 --> 03:11:28.080 line:15%
It appears now both sides have a

4151
03:11:30.425 --> 03:11:32.300 line:15%
cultist of some esteem in our midst.

4152
03:11:32.300 --> 03:11:34.870 line:15%
That bodes well for the negotiations.

4153
03:11:34.870 --> 03:11:36.250 line:15%
Should I just tell you?

4154
03:11:36.250 --> 03:11:38.090 line:15%
They said the negotiation's good to go.

4155
03:11:38.090 --> 03:11:39.340 line:15%
Everyone's getting ready.

4156
03:11:40.900 --> 03:11:42.410 line:15%
Four weeks.
Four weeks.

4157
03:11:44.160 --> 03:11:46.830 line:15%
They've probably notified at least someone in the council

4158
03:11:46.830 --> 03:11:50.080 line:15%
but I will pass this on as well.

4159
03:11:50.080 --> 03:11:53.790 line:15%
Four weeks, very well.

4160
03:11:53.790 --> 03:11:56.040 line:15%
Did you bring that project you were working on?

4161
03:11:56.040 --> 03:11:58.360 line:15%
I have it with me all the time, yeah.

4162
03:11:58.360 --> 03:12:00.020 line:15%
Do you want to eat first and then--

4163
03:12:00.020 --> 03:12:01.400 line:15%
Yes, let's, let's eat.

4164
03:12:01.400 --> 03:12:04.820 line:15%
Or you could eat and we can take a look at it.

4165
03:12:04.820 --> 03:12:05.770 line:15%
How was your day?

4166
03:12:06.764 --> 03:12:07.750 line:15%
(laughter)

4167
03:12:07.750 --> 03:12:10.330 line:15%
Fine, I've been here.
Yeah.

4168
03:12:10.330 --> 03:12:11.870 line:15%
Do you go out, like, during the day?

4169
03:12:11.870 --> 03:12:15.350 line:15%
Do you go shopping and stuff?
When necessary.

4170
03:12:16.626 --> 03:12:19.300 line:15%
Do you float in your house or do you walk in your house?

4171
03:12:19.300 --> 03:12:21.263 line:15%
Does he float in his house?

4172
03:12:21.263 --> 03:12:22.096 line:15%
He's currently floating and as soon

4173
03:12:22.096 --> 03:12:23.918 line:15%
as you say that, he goes (clicks tongue).

4174
03:12:23.918 --> 03:12:24.870 line:15%
(laughter)

4175
03:12:24.870 --> 03:12:27.080 line:15%
You don't have to float around us, man.

4176
03:12:27.080 --> 03:12:28.600 line:15%
It's cool.
It's a habit.

4177
03:12:30.390 --> 03:12:33.290 line:15%
You should walk with, what is it, a swagger.

4178
03:12:33.290 --> 03:12:35.760 line:15%
You could show, you could show him how to walk with swagger.

4179
03:12:35.760 --> 03:12:36.910 line:15%
I could totally teach you swagger.

4180
03:12:36.910 --> 03:12:39.530 line:15%
Like your ring walk, you know, like how you prep--

4181
03:12:39.530 --> 03:12:41.080 line:15%
Want me to teach you swagger?

4182
03:12:43.390 --> 03:12:44.570 line:15%
I don't know what that is.

4183
03:12:44.570 --> 03:12:46.574 line:15%
Sure, sure.
You know sass?

4184
03:12:46.574 --> 03:12:47.407 line:15%
Fucking crack it out, let's go.

4185
03:12:47.407 --> 03:12:49.935 line:15%
You know?
What are you, miming?

4186
03:12:49.935 --> 03:12:51.920 line:15%
What is this, what is--

4187
03:12:51.920 --> 03:12:53.540 line:15%
I just, I walk with swagger.

4188
03:12:55.145 --> 03:12:55.978 line:15%
Oh, oh.

4189
03:12:56.854 --> 03:12:57.950 line:15%
(laughter)

4190
03:12:57.950 --> 03:12:59.520 line:15%
A strut.
Yeah, do what she does.

4191
03:12:59.520 --> 03:13:01.600 line:15%
It's, you know.
Vogue.

4192
03:13:01.600 --> 03:13:03.280 line:15%
I'm good, thank you.
Aw, come on.

4193
03:13:03.280 --> 03:13:04.880 line:15%
I follow Beau around the room.

4194
03:13:06.300 --> 03:13:07.133 line:15%
Wow.
Very well.

4195
03:13:07.133 --> 03:13:09.130 line:15%
Can I have look at your notes?

4196
03:13:09.130 --> 03:13:10.630 line:15%
You know, this trick, right?

4197
03:13:12.437 --> 03:13:13.387 line:15%
You know this one?

4198
03:13:13.387 --> 03:13:14.400 line:15%
You push up.
Essek, Essek!

4199
03:13:14.400 --> 03:13:15.650 line:15%
His cloak is, like, completely

4200
03:13:15.650 --> 03:13:18.400 line:15%
obscuring his torso and he's--

4201
03:13:18.400 --> 03:13:19.740 line:15%
Essek, yeah?
You are

4202
03:13:19.740 --> 03:13:20.990 line:15%
making him uncomfortable.

4203
03:13:21.930 --> 03:13:23.100 line:15%
You're making him uncomfortable.

4204
03:13:23.100 --> 03:13:25.230 line:15%
Ka-pow, Storm Lord, thunder and lightning.

4205
03:13:27.074 --> 03:13:29.610 line:15%
Swagger.
There are cheeses.

4206
03:13:29.610 --> 03:13:32.260 line:15%
Ooh, I like cheese.
I am so excited for cheese.

4207
03:13:32.260 --> 03:13:36.340 line:15%
This is good.
What kind of pastries?

4208
03:13:36.340 --> 03:13:38.520 line:15%
Are we talking good pastries?

4209
03:13:38.520 --> 03:13:41.040 line:15%
They're, like, some small

4210
03:13:41.040 --> 03:13:42.800 line:15%
wafer cookies, nothing too super sweet.

4211
03:13:42.800 --> 03:13:44.970 line:15%
You're a little disappointed.

4212
03:13:44.970 --> 03:13:46.037 line:15%
They're okay.

4213
03:13:46.037 --> 03:13:46.870 line:15%
(laughter)

4214
03:13:46.870 --> 03:13:48.002 line:15%
Dry up the mouth a little bit.

4215
03:13:48.002 --> 03:13:49.756 line:15%
(laughter)

4216
03:13:49.756 --> 03:13:50.811 line:15%
I'm going to put a couple in my pocket.

4217
03:13:50.811 --> 03:13:52.700 line:15%
That's pretty good, disappointment.

4218
03:13:52.700 --> 03:13:53.750 line:15%
They're functional.

4219
03:13:54.847 --> 03:13:55.680 line:15%
It's like--
Show him!

4220
03:13:55.680 --> 03:13:56.513 line:15%
The grandma gives you vanilla wafers

4221
03:13:56.513 --> 03:13:57.500 line:15%
and you're like, "Mm."

4222
03:13:57.500 --> 03:13:59.440 line:15%
Right here or--
Yeah, show him the book.

4223
03:13:59.440 --> 03:14:02.480 line:15%
All right, so Caleb starts to move food and drink

4224
03:14:02.480 --> 03:14:03.390 line:15%
out of the way because he doesn't want to

4225
03:14:03.390 --> 03:14:07.440 line:15%
harm any of the books--
Here, come to my laboratory.

4226
03:14:07.440 --> 03:14:08.850 line:15%
It would be easier.
Oh.

4227
03:14:08.850 --> 03:14:10.560 line:15%
Should we all go?
No, no.

4228
03:14:10.560 --> 03:14:12.670 line:15%
Just them.
Just me and Caleb.

4229
03:14:12.670 --> 03:14:15.800 line:15%
Feed your ferret your crackers or whatever.

4230
03:14:15.800 --> 03:14:16.970 line:15%
All right, for a second.

4231
03:14:16.970 --> 03:14:19.850 line:15%
Nott, come.
Of course.

4232
03:14:19.850 --> 03:14:23.570 line:15%
He leads you up the stairs, gliding

4233
03:14:23.570 --> 03:14:25.770 line:15%
for the first few steps and then

4234
03:14:25.770 --> 03:14:28.110 line:15%
stops and starts actually taking steps.

4235
03:14:28.110 --> 03:14:31.130 line:15%
And you can see there's a bit of

4236
03:14:31.130 --> 03:14:33.650 line:15%
a disjointed aspect to it, you see him trying to

4237
03:14:33.650 --> 03:14:36.650 line:15%
change his instinctual behavior around you.

4238
03:14:36.650 --> 03:14:38.600 line:15%
I bet Essek gets, like, really tired when he's

4239
03:14:38.600 --> 03:14:41.100 line:15%
walking up stairs now because he's not used to doing it,

4240
03:14:41.100 --> 03:14:43.239 line:15%
so when he's forced to do it, it's like.

4241
03:14:43.239 --> 03:14:45.386 line:15%
(laughter)

4242
03:14:45.386 --> 03:14:46.219 line:15%
He doesn't want to act winded but he's, like,

4243
03:14:46.219 --> 03:14:49.290 line:15%
probably really outta breath by the time he's at the top.

4244
03:14:49.290 --> 03:14:51.580 line:15%
You head up to a secondary floor.

4245
03:14:51.580 --> 03:14:53.730 line:15%
This one has a window that overlooks

4246
03:14:53.730 --> 03:14:55.370 line:15%
that part of the neighborhood.

4247
03:14:55.370 --> 03:14:57.310 line:15%
There are a number of shelves of books,

4248
03:14:57.310 --> 03:15:00.940 line:15%
there are some small glass cases that contain

4249
03:15:00.940 --> 03:15:03.070 line:15%
what looks to be keepsakes or objects

4250
03:15:03.070 --> 03:15:04.330 line:15%
that are just out of view.

4251
03:15:04.330 --> 03:15:06.770 line:15%
He leads you to one of two doors

4252
03:15:06.770 --> 03:15:08.600 line:15%
that opens up into one of those pathways

4253
03:15:08.600 --> 03:15:10.630 line:15%
that connects towers and leads you to

4254
03:15:10.630 --> 03:15:13.710 line:15%
the tallest tower and from there, you go into

4255
03:15:13.710 --> 03:15:16.880 line:15%
a mid-chamber of this next structure.

4256
03:15:16.880 --> 03:15:20.590 line:15%
Within here, the smell itself is almost saccharin sweet

4257
03:15:20.590 --> 03:15:21.910 line:15%
but has a very chemical smell to it.

4258
03:15:21.910 --> 03:15:23.830 line:15%
You recognize it, as an alchemist.

4259
03:15:23.830 --> 03:15:26.720 line:15%
There are a lot of elements here that remind you

4260
03:15:26.720 --> 03:15:30.710 line:15%
of very sweet but caustic chemicals

4261
03:15:30.710 --> 03:15:33.300 line:15%
that are used in the creation of potions,

4262
03:15:33.300 --> 03:15:35.640 line:15%
that are used in the creation of compounds

4263
03:15:35.640 --> 03:15:38.350 line:15%
that can break down metals and other such things.

4264
03:15:38.350 --> 03:15:40.610 line:15%
It's a mixture of some alchemy

4265
03:15:40.610 --> 03:15:42.660 line:15%
or elements close to it are done in here.

4266
03:15:44.572 --> 03:15:46.100 line:15%
But then he leads you up another set of stairs

4267
03:15:46.100 --> 03:15:49.670 line:15%
to a tall chamber beneath where you imagine

4268
03:15:49.670 --> 03:15:52.180 line:15%
that strange moving spherical

4269
03:15:52.180 --> 03:15:54.010 line:15%
series of rings were on the top.

4270
03:15:54.010 --> 03:15:55.510 line:15%
As you head into this final room,

4271
03:15:55.510 --> 03:15:59.370 line:15%
the entire chamber itself has these deep grooves

4272
03:15:59.370 --> 03:16:02.370 line:15%
dug into stone across and edge to edge.

4273
03:16:02.370 --> 03:16:04.240 line:15%
And you immediately recognize it.

4274
03:16:04.240 --> 03:16:06.660 line:15%
It is, I mean, it's hundreds and hundreds of lines.

4275
03:16:06.660 --> 03:16:10.150 line:15%
It looks like someone has just dug every possible

4276
03:16:10.150 --> 03:16:12.290 line:15%
line path connecting element here

4277
03:16:12.290 --> 03:16:16.290 line:15%
and for certain magicians or sorcerers,

4278
03:16:16.290 --> 03:16:18.880 line:15%
practitioners of magic, this is essentially

4279
03:16:18.880 --> 03:16:21.270 line:15%
a bunch of pre-set grooves that most

4280
03:16:22.597 --> 03:16:27.597 line:15%
basic and advanced runic circles can be drawn within here

4281
03:16:27.840 --> 03:16:30.451 line:15%
with whatever materials very quickly.

4282
03:16:30.451 --> 03:16:32.671 line:15%
(hands rubbing together)

4283
03:16:32.671 --> 03:16:35.207 line:15%
(exhaling)

4284
03:16:35.207 --> 03:16:36.680 line:15%
This is beautiful.

4285
03:16:37.570 --> 03:16:39.490 line:15%
All the candles immediately light

4286
03:16:39.490 --> 03:16:41.810 line:15%
as you all step inside.

4287
03:16:41.810 --> 03:16:42.718 line:15%
Are we all there or is just--

4288
03:16:42.718 --> 03:16:44.960 line:15%
Just the two of them.
Oh.

4289
03:16:44.960 --> 03:16:46.580 line:15%
I can't help it, I will always

4290
03:16:46.580 --> 03:16:48.800 line:15%
love the architecture of a tower.

4291
03:16:51.856 --> 03:16:52.689 line:15%
We stick with them for a reason,

4292
03:16:52.689 --> 03:16:54.400 line:15%
it seems, as haggling as it may be.

4293
03:16:55.590 --> 03:16:57.170 line:15%
Come, come, set it down.

4294
03:16:57.170 --> 03:16:58.930 line:15%
And he like--
Closer to the heavens.

4295
03:16:58.930 --> 03:17:00.330 line:15%
I start laying stuff out.

4296
03:17:00.330 --> 03:17:04.770 line:15%
So, um, this is what we acquired.

4297
03:17:04.770 --> 03:17:08.440 line:15%
This is very old, these are unfinished but,

4298
03:17:08.440 --> 03:17:12.360 line:15%
but much to be gleaned and I've done my best with them.

4299
03:17:12.360 --> 03:17:14.120 line:15%
I lay out of Halas' stuff.
Mmkay.

4300
03:17:14.120 --> 03:17:15.640 line:15%
And then here is--
He takes his mantle off

4301
03:17:15.640 --> 03:17:17.600 line:15%
and sets it aside and comes over to join you

4302
03:17:17.600 --> 03:17:18.970 line:15%
as you guys start laying it out.

4303
03:17:18.970 --> 03:17:21.930 line:15%
And you see, and he's listening to you with one ear

4304
03:17:21.930 --> 03:17:23.960 line:15%
and the rest of his mind is

4305
03:17:23.960 --> 03:17:26.460 line:15%
in the process of taking in the extent of

4306
03:17:26.460 --> 03:17:28.790 line:15%
what you've already drawn and connected.

4307
03:17:28.790 --> 03:17:31.180 line:15%
And Caleb recognizes that and says,

4308
03:17:31.180 --> 03:17:33.090 line:15%
"Okay, so while you're taking that in,

4309
03:17:33.090 --> 03:17:34.220 line:15%
"Nott help me roll this out.

4310
03:17:34.220 --> 03:17:36.100 line:15%
"And here is what Nott and I have been working on.

4311
03:17:36.100 --> 03:17:38.680 line:15%
"This is my approximation, I've tried to

4312
03:17:38.680 --> 03:17:41.320 line:15%
"fill in some of the blanks and this

4313
03:17:41.320 --> 03:17:44.250 line:15%
"particular knot was hard to unravel, but we did.

4314
03:17:44.250 --> 03:17:47.450 line:15%
"And I know that I'm close,

4315
03:17:47.450 --> 03:17:50.010 line:15%
"but I am sure I am missing something."

4316
03:17:50.010 --> 03:17:53.019 line:15%
Yeah, but he's got that look in his eye, he's close.

4317
03:17:53.019 --> 03:17:54.010 line:15%
I can see that look.

4318
03:17:55.251 --> 03:17:57.750 line:15%
(sighs) All right, I have some ideas.

4319
03:17:57.750 --> 03:18:00.250 line:15%
And he walks over to his shelf and starts

4320
03:18:00.250 --> 03:18:03.180 line:15%
thumbing through different compounds

4321
03:18:03.180 --> 03:18:05.460 line:15%
and pulling out elements and taking out

4322
03:18:05.460 --> 03:18:06.970 line:15%
some additional books under his arm

4323
03:18:06.970 --> 03:18:10.320 line:15%
and basically gets down on the floor with the two of you

4324
03:18:10.320 --> 03:18:12.750 line:15%
and begins attempting to continue this.

4325
03:18:12.750 --> 03:18:14.590 line:15%
You guys are having your cheeses and your snacks.

4326
03:18:14.590 --> 03:18:16.330 line:15%
We're practicing our swaggers.

4327
03:18:16.330 --> 03:18:18.770 line:15%
About 40 minutes rolls by they've been gone

4328
03:18:18.770 --> 03:18:20.130 line:15%
and you guys have just been sitting there

4329
03:18:20.130 --> 03:18:22.840 line:15%
and waiting and talking and they have just not returned.

4330
03:18:22.840 --> 03:18:24.600 line:15%
Looking around his place.
Yeah.

4331
03:18:24.600 --> 03:18:26.880 line:15%
There's a red button to push somewhere.

4332
03:18:26.880 --> 03:18:28.570 line:15%
I don't want to touch anything,

4333
03:18:28.570 --> 03:18:31.170 line:15%
but doing the like looky-looks.

4334
03:18:31.170 --> 03:18:33.750 line:15%
Speak for yourself.
Okay.

4335
03:18:33.750 --> 03:18:36.400 line:15%
I just don't want to, like, he'll know, right?

4336
03:18:37.250 --> 03:18:38.083 line:15%
Boop.
Ugh.

4337
03:18:39.190 --> 03:18:42.150 line:15%
What'd we find?
Well, roll an investigation,

4338
03:18:42.150 --> 03:18:44.440 line:15%
or maybe perception check if you're just looking around.

4339
03:18:44.440 --> 03:18:45.810 line:15%
You, like, looking in his bookshelf

4340
03:18:45.810 --> 03:18:46.920 line:15%
or are you going to the bathroom and, like,

4341
03:18:46.920 --> 03:18:48.120 line:15%
looking in the medicine cabinet

4342
03:18:48.120 --> 03:18:49.930 line:15%
to see what weird medicine he takes?

4343
03:18:49.930 --> 03:18:51.480 line:15%
Like the medicine cabinet type of stuff.

4344
03:18:51.480 --> 03:18:52.710 line:15%
Ooh, what's this cream? (laughs)

4345
03:18:52.710 --> 03:18:53.860 line:15%
Is that a difference, between

4346
03:18:53.860 --> 03:18:55.710 line:15%
medicine cabinet versus just looking?

4347
03:18:57.650 --> 03:18:59.630 line:15%
Well, but whatta ya mean?

4348
03:19:00.640 --> 03:19:03.240 line:15%
You find his bedroom and locate his bathroom.

4349
03:19:03.240 --> 03:19:04.740 line:15%
Yeah, there's a difference between

4350
03:19:04.740 --> 03:19:06.410 line:15%
being like, "What room is this?

4351
03:19:06.410 --> 03:19:09.140 line:15%
Oh, master bath," and being like, "I'm going to go pee,"

4352
03:19:09.140 --> 03:19:11.350 line:15%
and being like, "Ooh," behind the medicine cabinet.

4353
03:19:11.350 --> 03:19:13.370 line:15%
That's some shady shit.
That is some shady shit.

4354
03:19:13.370 --> 03:19:14.203 line:15%
Okay.
I do that

4355
03:19:14.203 --> 03:19:16.650 line:15%
to every house I go to.
You, we know that.

4356
03:19:16.650 --> 03:19:18.416 line:15%
If you invite me over, I'm going to look at all your shit.

4357
03:19:18.416 --> 03:19:20.460 line:15%
(laughter)

4358
03:19:20.460 --> 03:19:22.050 line:15%
So disappointed by the medicated shampoo--

4359
03:19:22.050 --> 03:19:23.750 line:15%
That's why I always put a note in the medicine cabinet

4360
03:19:23.750 --> 03:19:25.780 line:15%
whenever you come over that says, "Hi Sam."

4361
03:19:25.780 --> 03:19:28.040 line:15%
Okay, all right.

4362
03:19:29.935 --> 03:19:31.970 line:15%
You head upstairs, or in the chamber you're in right here,

4363
03:19:31.970 --> 03:19:34.140 line:15%
you can see plainly most of it's just furniture,

4364
03:19:34.140 --> 03:19:37.150 line:15%
it's a hosting chamber, it seems, so a lot of it's dusty.

4365
03:19:38.690 --> 03:19:41.290 line:15%
It's generally just furniture and decor.

4366
03:19:42.190 --> 03:19:43.840 line:15%
Do you go in the staircase above?

4367
03:19:45.170 --> 03:19:46.770 line:15%
Just, which way are you going?

4368
03:19:47.660 --> 03:19:50.340 line:15%
Look for yourself, what are you doing?

4369
03:19:50.340 --> 03:19:53.750 line:15%
Well, I just, I figured we could divide and conquer.

4370
03:19:53.750 --> 03:19:55.390 line:15%
I'll go upstairs.
Okay.

4371
03:19:56.650 --> 03:19:58.040 line:15%
You head up into (laughs).

4372
03:19:59.607 --> 03:20:00.760 line:15%
(roaring)

4373
03:20:00.760 --> 03:20:02.560 line:15%
Oh, that's the end of Beau right there.

4374
03:20:02.560 --> 03:20:04.430 line:15%
This is the next chamber, this is where you see

4375
03:20:04.430 --> 03:20:06.810 line:15%
there are bookshelves aligned in this area,

4376
03:20:06.810 --> 03:20:08.540 line:15%
there are the two doorways, they're closed,

4377
03:20:08.540 --> 03:20:10.500 line:15%
that lead out of the tower to those

4378
03:20:10.500 --> 03:20:12.730 line:15%
walkways you thought you had seen.

4379
03:20:12.730 --> 03:20:15.940 line:15%
There are a couple of small, looks like glass cases

4380
03:20:15.940 --> 03:20:17.200 line:15%
that are off to the side.

4381
03:20:17.200 --> 03:20:19.180 line:15%
What's with those glass cases?

4382
03:20:19.180 --> 03:20:20.970 line:15%
You go ahead and look within.

4383
03:20:20.970 --> 03:20:22.970 line:15%
One of them contains, it looks to be a rod,

4384
03:20:22.970 --> 03:20:24.820 line:15%
maybe about a foot and a half long.

4385
03:20:26.530 --> 03:20:29.850 line:15%
The other one, glancing inside, you can see

4386
03:20:29.850 --> 03:20:31.750 line:15%
there's two books that are locked

4387
03:20:34.366 --> 03:20:36.730 line:15%
with a actual physical lock holding them closed.

4388
03:20:36.730 --> 03:20:39.650 line:15%
Can I see, like, do they have a name, title?

4389
03:20:39.650 --> 03:20:40.870 line:15%
Do you know Undercommon?

4390
03:20:40.870 --> 03:20:43.300 line:15%
Yes, I do now.
You do.

4391
03:20:45.970 --> 03:20:49.950 line:15%
Glancing at one of them, it goes into,

4392
03:20:50.970 --> 03:20:54.440 line:15%
the title at least, and only one of them has a title,

4393
03:20:54.440 --> 03:20:57.150 line:15%
the other one is, like, just a plain leather binding,

4394
03:20:58.320 --> 03:21:00.870 line:15%
like a deep, deep leather, but there's no actual top.

4395
03:21:00.870 --> 03:21:03.450 line:15%
The first one you look over and it says

4396
03:21:03.450 --> 03:21:06.450 line:15%
in Undercommon the equivalent of

4397
03:21:07.610 --> 03:21:10.670 line:15%
the connecting nether between the elements.

4398
03:21:11.670 --> 03:21:13.030 line:15%
You're not quite sure what that refers to

4399
03:21:13.030 --> 03:21:15.970 line:15%
or what the contents might be toying with,

4400
03:21:15.970 --> 03:21:18.120 line:15%
but it seems to be something referring to

4401
03:21:19.530 --> 03:21:21.310 line:15%
the elements.
Okay.

4402
03:21:24.600 --> 03:21:26.350 line:15%
Dark matter shit, all right, cool.

4403
03:21:27.800 --> 03:21:29.260 line:15%
Anything else I can check out?

4404
03:21:29.260 --> 03:21:31.050 line:15%
Do I have time?
There are double doors.

4405
03:21:31.050 --> 03:21:34.240 line:15%
There's the two doors.
And then what else?

4406
03:21:34.240 --> 03:21:35.640 line:15%
Bookshelves?
Bookshelves.

4407
03:21:36.940 --> 03:21:40.530 line:15%
Uh, I just peek out the two doors,

4408
03:21:40.530 --> 03:21:42.270 line:15%
do like a crack and a crack?

4409
03:21:42.270 --> 03:21:43.480 line:15%
Neither of the doors open.
Fuck.

4410
03:21:43.480 --> 03:21:45.880 line:15%
They are closed and they are locked.

4411
03:21:45.880 --> 03:21:47.730 line:15%
(pen clicking)

4412
03:21:47.730 --> 03:21:50.640 line:15%
Right, back to the bookshelves, do a quick scan.

4413
03:21:50.640 --> 03:21:52.360 line:15%
Okay, it's all manner of collection,

4414
03:21:52.360 --> 03:21:53.970 line:15%
all in Undercommon for the most part,

4415
03:21:53.970 --> 03:21:55.720 line:15%
a couple of spattering of Common books.

4416
03:21:55.720 --> 03:21:58.560 line:15%
Some of them are history, some of them deal with

4417
03:21:58.560 --> 03:22:01.090 line:15%
studies of alchemical compounds,

4418
03:22:01.090 --> 03:22:05.420 line:15%
some of them deal with historical recollections

4419
03:22:05.420 --> 03:22:07.970 line:15%
of the Age of Arcanum and what elements

4420
03:22:07.970 --> 03:22:09.870 line:15%
have been collected from what ruins have been found

4421
03:22:09.870 --> 03:22:11.830 line:15%
and it covered writings of

4422
03:22:13.890 --> 03:22:16.540 line:15%
prominent figures during that time period.

4423
03:22:16.540 --> 03:22:21.390 line:15%
You see one that deals with the various societies

4424
03:22:22.664 --> 03:22:26.440 line:15%
and races of Xhorhas and the social dynamics

4425
03:22:26.440 --> 03:22:29.850 line:15%
pre- and post-Dynasty involvement.

4426
03:22:29.850 --> 03:22:31.070 line:15%
These are just the things you,

4427
03:22:31.070 --> 03:22:34.670 line:15%
it's a wide variety of books.
Okay, okay, okay.

4428
03:22:34.670 --> 03:22:36.210 line:15%
I just head back downstairs

4429
03:22:36.210 --> 03:22:38.420 line:15%
and I relay what I found to Fjord.

4430
03:22:39.350 --> 03:22:42.040 line:15%
Glass cases, books.
Man.

4431
03:22:42.040 --> 03:22:44.140 line:15%
That's so tempting, but I mean, we just established

4432
03:22:44.140 --> 03:22:44.973 line:15%
a friendship.
We really,

4433
03:22:44.973 --> 03:22:46.100 line:15%
I don't want to, I don't want to be a dick.

4434
03:22:46.100 --> 03:22:46.960 line:15%
All right, fair, yeah.
I'm just

4435
03:22:46.960 --> 03:22:48.410 line:15%
trying, I'm just being nosy.

4436
03:22:49.410 --> 03:22:51.620 line:15%
What'd you find?
Nothing.

4437
03:22:51.620 --> 03:22:52.880 line:15%
He has no guests, ever.

4438
03:22:52.880 --> 03:22:54.430 line:15%
There's, like, nothing in here.

4439
03:22:55.740 --> 03:22:57.540 line:15%
It's just kind of bland.
I like it.

4440
03:22:58.439 --> 03:23:00.189 line:15%
I think it's really nice in here.

4441
03:23:02.110 --> 03:23:05.120 line:15%
Simple.
It's got nice staircases.

4442
03:23:05.120 --> 03:23:06.570 line:15%
It's a very nice staircase.

4443
03:23:07.500 --> 03:23:10.290 line:15%
I'm going to take out my harp and play a little.

4444
03:23:10.290 --> 03:23:12.410 line:15%
Okay.
To pass the time.

4445
03:23:12.410 --> 03:23:14.730 line:15%
I'm going to dance while she's playing the harp.

4446
03:23:14.730 --> 03:23:15.770 line:15%
Okay, the acoustics--
I'm going to take out

4447
03:23:15.770 --> 03:23:17.320 line:15%
my flute--
Swaggerly dances.

4448
03:23:18.372 --> 03:23:19.205 line:15%
There's got to be something about this guy.

4449
03:23:19.205 --> 03:23:20.500 line:15%
So, she swagger dances and then starts

4450
03:23:20.500 --> 03:23:23.950 line:15%
playing the harp with a beautiful sound fills the chamber

4451
03:23:23.950 --> 03:23:28.040 line:15%
and then the bone flute starts playing.

4452
03:23:28.040 --> 03:23:29.890 line:15%
Oh no, I'm not going to actually, I'm just--

4453
03:23:29.890 --> 03:23:30.723 line:15%
Okay.

4454
03:23:30.723 --> 03:23:33.288 line:15%
(laughter)

4455
03:23:33.288 --> 03:23:34.480 line:15%
I know.

4456
03:23:37.195 --> 03:23:38.257 line:15%
In the interim, go ahead and make

4457
03:23:38.257 --> 03:23:39.140 line:15%
an arcana check with an advantage.

4458
03:23:39.140 --> 03:23:42.070 line:15%
Uh, is it all right if I, oh, with advantage, great.

4459
03:23:42.950 --> 03:23:45.460 line:15%
No need, no need.
Come on.

4460
03:23:45.460 --> 03:23:48.920 line:15%
Come on.
Roll that shit.

4461
03:23:48.920 --> 03:23:49.850 line:15%
'Kay, cool, cool.

4462
03:23:49.850 --> 03:23:51.770 line:15%
Are we doing doctor--
Cool, cool, cool.

4463
03:23:51.770 --> 03:23:53.160 line:15%
Intelligence or arcana, did you say?

4464
03:23:53.160 --> 03:23:54.350 line:15%
Arcana.
28.

4465
03:23:54.350 --> 03:23:56.291 line:15%
Yes.
Whoa!

4466
03:23:56.291 --> 03:23:57.250 line:15%
(whooping)

4467
03:23:57.250 --> 03:23:58.330 line:15%
Showing off in front of Essek.

4468
03:23:58.330 --> 03:23:59.870 line:15%
Big wizard energy.

4469
03:23:59.870 --> 03:24:00.703 line:15%
(sighing)

4470
03:24:00.703 --> 03:24:03.260 line:15%
The three of you begin to sync and, like,

4471
03:24:03.260 --> 03:24:05.650 line:15%
one person'll pause at a question where they're

4472
03:24:05.650 --> 03:24:07.550 line:15%
at a point in the equation and the next finishes it,

4473
03:24:07.550 --> 03:24:10.240 line:15%
they make eye contact and smile, grab something,

4474
03:24:10.240 --> 03:24:12.860 line:15%
finish that line, grab this piece of paper, toss it to you,

4475
03:24:12.860 --> 03:24:15.440 line:15%
this equation finishes, and rapidly you become,

4476
03:24:15.440 --> 03:24:17.990 line:15%
the three of you become fervored researchers,

4477
03:24:17.990 --> 03:24:19.990 line:15%
on the cusp of a breakthrough.

4478
03:24:19.990 --> 03:24:23.340 line:15%
By the close of the hour, the moment hits

4479
03:24:23.340 --> 03:24:25.429 line:15%
where the equation connects

4480
03:24:25.429 --> 03:24:26.262 line:15%
(gasping)

4481
03:24:26.262 --> 03:24:29.245 line:15%
and the spell is complete.

4482
03:24:29.245 --> 03:24:30.078 line:15%
(gasping)

4483
03:24:30.078 --> 03:24:30.911 line:15%
Oh, oh!

4484
03:24:32.700 --> 03:24:33.880 line:15%
Oh!

4485
03:24:33.880 --> 03:24:36.462 line:15%
Essek stands up and he's like,

4486
03:24:36.462 --> 03:24:41.000 line:15%
(brushes hands together) "I don't, I don't know what to say.

4487
03:24:41.000 --> 03:24:44.830 line:15%
"This is very impressive."
You are amazing.

4488
03:24:44.830 --> 03:24:46.430 line:15%
This does not happen very often.

4489
03:24:47.630 --> 03:24:50.090 line:15%
This is history, pulled from history.

4490
03:24:51.521 --> 03:24:52.810 line:15%
(paper rustling)

4491
03:24:52.810 --> 03:24:54.310 line:15%
Thank you.

4492
03:24:54.310 --> 03:24:56.640 line:15%
Well, you had done most of the legwork yourselves.

4493
03:24:57.510 --> 03:24:59.730 line:15%
Thank you both for this.

4494
03:24:59.730 --> 03:25:01.750 line:15%
Can we do it?

4495
03:25:03.360 --> 03:25:05.680 line:15%
What are the features of this?

4496
03:25:05.680 --> 03:25:07.630 line:15%
Time--
You--

4497
03:25:07.630 --> 03:25:09.810 line:15%
Needed, requirements of components.

4498
03:25:10.800 --> 03:25:14.530 line:15%
The component for this requires a,

4499
03:25:15.470 --> 03:25:18.520 line:15%
about 50 pounds of raw clay,

4500
03:25:20.940 --> 03:25:22.310 line:15%
which the spell consumes,

4501
03:25:24.220 --> 03:25:25.620 line:15%
as well as about

4502
03:25:26.481 --> 03:25:28.442 line:15%
(paper rustling)

4503
03:25:28.442 --> 03:25:31.030 line:15%
a hundred gold worth of ground gem dust,

4504
03:25:31.030 --> 03:25:34.650 line:15%
doesn't matter the gem, and it takes

4505
03:25:34.650 --> 03:25:37.067 line:15%
about an hour to cast the spell.

4506
03:25:37.067 --> 03:25:40.817 line:15%
(pencil scratching on paper)

4507
03:25:41.780 --> 03:25:42.680 line:15%
What does it do?

4508
03:25:44.940 --> 03:25:46.970 line:15%
I'll give you the specifics,

4509
03:25:46.970 --> 03:25:50.040 line:15%
but the overall essence of the spell,

4510
03:25:50.040 --> 03:25:52.480 line:15%
as you look over the final equation, is,

4511
03:25:54.195 --> 03:25:57.697 line:15%
if done properly, it is a permanent alteration

4512
03:25:59.573 --> 03:26:03.670 line:15%
of the target's body from one known humanoid race

4513
03:26:03.670 --> 03:26:04.650 line:15%
to another.
Oh.

4514
03:26:05.670 --> 03:26:08.253 line:15%
(gentle music)

4515
03:26:10.150 --> 03:26:10.983 line:15%
Well.

4516
03:26:14.810 --> 03:26:16.690 line:15%
(exhales)

4517
03:26:16.690 --> 03:26:18.590 line:15%
We need clay, I don't have any.

4518
03:26:18.590 --> 03:26:19.880 line:15%
I don't have any.
No.

4519
03:26:19.880 --> 03:26:22.000 line:15%
You don't have that much clay, do you?

4520
03:26:22.000 --> 03:26:22.833 line:15%
I have a yard.

4521
03:26:24.720 --> 03:26:27.010 line:15%
I've got a shovel.
You're not there.

4522
03:26:27.010 --> 03:26:28.240 line:15%
Oh shit, nevermind.

4523
03:26:28.240 --> 03:26:29.258 line:15%
(laughter)

4524
03:26:29.258 --> 03:26:30.110 line:15%
I was so into it.

4525
03:26:30.110 --> 03:26:31.270 line:15%
A yard, he said?

4526
03:26:32.680 --> 03:26:35.050 line:15%
That's, clay's just--
Dirt.

4527
03:26:37.514 --> 03:26:39.287 line:15%
A special kind of dirt.
Do you?

4528
03:26:42.120 --> 03:26:44.760 line:15%
Caleb just pulls the goblin and the elf in

4529
03:26:44.760 --> 03:26:49.120 line:15%
for just a huge hug and then pulls us all out again.

4530
03:26:50.541 --> 03:26:53.350 line:15%
Do you want to do this now or do you want to think about it?

4531
03:26:53.350 --> 03:26:54.183 line:15%
Uh.

4532
03:26:59.400 --> 03:27:04.230 line:15%
Maybe I'll just give it a day or an hour or a day.

4533
03:27:07.370 --> 03:27:10.790 line:15%
Whatever you need.
This is amazing.

4534
03:27:10.790 --> 03:27:12.050 line:15%
Thank you so much.

4535
03:27:13.080 --> 03:27:14.980 line:15%
Maybe I'll just give it a day, though.

4536
03:27:16.170 --> 03:27:17.720 line:15%
Just to figure out,

4537
03:27:21.050 --> 03:27:21.900 line:15%
yeah, just a day.

4538
03:27:22.878 --> 03:27:25.461 line:15%
(gentle music)

4539
03:27:26.410 --> 03:27:27.243 line:15%
Yeah.

4540
03:27:28.930 --> 03:27:30.700 line:15%
Yeah, yeah.
Yes.

4541
03:27:30.700 --> 03:27:33.612 line:15%
We can do this tomorrow.
Just deliberate on it

4542
03:27:33.612 --> 03:27:35.100 line:15%
for a bit.
Yeah.

4543
03:27:35.100 --> 03:27:37.870 line:15%
(gentle music)

4544
03:27:37.870 --> 03:27:40.480 line:15%
You know, the others are probably wondering--

4545
03:27:40.480 --> 03:27:42.870 line:15%
Yes, it has been some time, my apologies.

4546
03:27:42.870 --> 03:27:45.120 line:15%
They're probably having, like, a threesome.

4547
03:27:46.330 --> 03:27:48.330 line:15%
What do you mean?
Pssh, I got the books!

4548
03:27:48.330 --> 03:27:49.484 line:15%
No, I'm just kidding.

4549
03:27:49.484 --> 03:27:50.317 line:15%
(laughter)

4550
03:27:50.317 --> 03:27:51.150 line:15%
Run!
But, um--

4551
03:27:52.574 --> 03:27:55.300 line:15%
You think Essek and Nott and Caleb?

4552
03:27:55.300 --> 03:27:57.170 line:15%
For what?
I mean, they could just be,

4553
03:27:57.170 --> 03:27:59.050 line:15%
you know, having a real good time up there.

4554
03:27:59.050 --> 03:28:01.230 line:15%
I assume they are having a really good time up there.

4555
03:28:01.230 --> 03:28:03.540 line:15%
So you probably think they're having a threesome?

4556
03:28:03.540 --> 03:28:04.520 line:15%
I don't--
Maybe

4557
03:28:04.520 --> 03:28:08.010 line:15%
they're churning butter.
That'd be good because

4558
03:28:08.010 --> 03:28:10.810 line:15%
I'd really like to make another round of these crackers.

4559
03:28:12.055 --> 03:28:12.888 line:15%
I feel like we can improve on this.

4560
03:28:12.888 --> 03:28:13.721 line:15%
Yeah, they need more sugar.

4561
03:28:13.721 --> 03:28:15.640 line:15%
A little bit more sugar, not what I did,

4562
03:28:16.480 --> 03:28:18.250 line:15%
let's all forget what I did yesterday,

4563
03:28:18.250 --> 03:28:20.740 line:15%
but we could, we could, oh, I got to

4564
03:28:20.740 --> 03:28:22.940 line:15%
take a look at the kitchen, see what we got.

4565
03:28:24.000 --> 03:28:25.200 line:15%
We work well together.

4566
03:28:26.680 --> 03:28:28.230 line:15%
We should explore other things.

4567
03:28:29.920 --> 03:28:30.753 line:15%
Other things.

4568
03:28:34.663 --> 03:28:36.290 line:15%
I have some ideas.

4569
03:28:36.290 --> 03:28:37.690 line:15%
There are favors owed still.

4570
03:28:40.330 --> 03:28:42.420 line:15%
Anyway, let's get back to the rest of

4571
03:28:42.420 --> 03:28:43.290 line:15%
your friends.
Yes, yes.

4572
03:28:43.290 --> 03:28:45.892 line:15%
They're probably fucking down there or something.

4573
03:28:45.892 --> 03:28:47.695 line:15%
(laughter)

4574
03:28:47.695 --> 03:28:48.763 line:15%
Probably having a fivesome.

4575
03:28:48.763 --> 03:28:50.320 line:15%
(laughter)

4576
03:28:50.320 --> 03:28:53.330 line:15%
Gather up the notes, the finalization of the spell,

4577
03:28:53.330 --> 03:28:54.990 line:15%
hands it to you, and you guys return.

4578
03:28:54.990 --> 03:28:56.650 line:15%
You hear the door upstairs.

4579
03:28:56.650 --> 03:28:58.190 line:15%
You go towards where you think

4580
03:28:58.190 --> 03:29:00.040 line:15%
the kitchen might be and the door is locked.

4581
03:29:01.280 --> 03:29:03.679 line:15%
Well, this is half the problem right here.

4582
03:29:03.679 --> 03:29:06.192 line:15%
(laughter)

4583
03:29:06.192 --> 03:29:07.025 line:15%
Fucking doors.

4584
03:29:07.025 --> 03:29:08.320 line:15%
(throat clearing)

4585
03:29:08.320 --> 03:29:11.260 line:15%
You hear the familiar footsteps of Caleb and Nott.

4586
03:29:11.260 --> 03:29:13.640 line:15%
Caleb has Nott backpack-style with

4587
03:29:13.640 --> 03:29:16.220 line:15%
a real spring in his step coming down the stairs.

4588
03:29:16.220 --> 03:29:17.720 line:15%
Hey!
Hey, sorry to keep you--

4589
03:29:17.720 --> 03:29:19.800 line:15%
Did you guys have so much fun?

4590
03:29:19.800 --> 03:29:22.660 line:15%
We did, it's a lovely, it's a lovely lab.

4591
03:29:22.660 --> 03:29:25.570 line:15%
Do you feel relaxed and carefree?

4592
03:29:25.570 --> 03:29:27.360 line:15%
Energized.
Really?

4593
03:29:27.360 --> 03:29:29.140 line:15%
Yeah.
Oh shit, you were right.

4594
03:29:29.140 --> 03:29:31.650 line:15%
He is intelligent.
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

4595
03:29:33.435 --> 03:29:36.020 line:15%
He knows his way around?
And he can float!

4596
03:29:36.020 --> 03:29:36.853 line:15%
Mm-hmm.
Just saying.

4597
03:29:36.853 --> 03:29:38.920 line:15%
He's right over there.
Oh, hi.

4598
03:29:38.920 --> 03:29:41.110 line:15%
He's heading down after the two of them.

4599
03:29:41.110 --> 03:29:43.070 line:15%
You seem like you're in a very good mood.

4600
03:29:45.030 --> 03:29:48.050 line:15%
Knowledge, knowledge can do that to you, right?

4601
03:29:49.200 --> 03:29:50.033 line:15%
Everything go okay?

4602
03:29:50.033 --> 03:29:51.160 line:15%
Everything work out?

4603
03:29:51.160 --> 03:29:53.500 line:15%
Where are we at?
We, I've learned things

4604
03:29:53.500 --> 03:29:55.800 line:15%
that I did not know even an hour ago.

4605
03:29:57.310 --> 03:29:58.740 line:15%
Yeah.

4606
03:29:58.740 --> 03:30:02.120 line:15%
You'll be happy to know we didn't explore too far.

4607
03:30:02.120 --> 03:30:04.140 line:15%
We did go upstairs and look at your sort of

4608
03:30:04.140 --> 03:30:06.550 line:15%
lair of bookshelves and your glass cases

4609
03:30:06.550 --> 03:30:09.390 line:15%
and we tried to wander further but it's locked.

4610
03:30:09.390 --> 03:30:10.950 line:15%
They did, we stayed here.

4611
03:30:10.950 --> 03:30:13.000 line:15%
We're very polite.
Hey, we own that shit.

4612
03:30:13.000 --> 03:30:14.870 line:15%
Tried to find the kitchen.
I'm curious.

4613
03:30:14.870 --> 03:30:17.670 line:15%
I don't care what you keep in your home, so.

4614
03:30:17.670 --> 03:30:20.030 line:15%
Well, I appreciate all of that, mostly.

4615
03:30:21.033 --> 03:30:25.690 line:15%
(sighs) But quite a discovery made by these two.

4616
03:30:26.720 --> 03:30:27.690 line:15%
Well--
Mm-hmm.

4617
03:30:28.590 --> 03:30:29.440 line:15%
What discovery?

4618
03:30:31.989 --> 03:30:36.440 line:15%
We may, we may have a way to, uh, to fix me.

4619
03:30:36.440 --> 03:30:37.420 line:15%
(gasping)

4620
03:30:37.420 --> 03:30:38.410 line:15%
Yeah, yeah.
Really?

4621
03:30:39.544 --> 03:30:40.377 line:15%
How do you feel about that?

4622
03:30:40.377 --> 03:30:43.440 line:15%
You know, excited.
Yeah?

4623
03:30:43.440 --> 03:30:46.310 line:15%
The permanent fix you've been looking for this whole time?

4624
03:30:46.310 --> 03:30:47.530 line:15%
So it seems, yeah.

4625
03:30:47.530 --> 03:30:49.990 line:15%
Back to your original form?
Uh huh.

4626
03:30:51.170 --> 03:30:53.110 line:15%
Essek, that's incredible.
Wow.

4627
03:30:53.110 --> 03:30:55.660 line:15%
Don't look at me, I was merely a final catalyst.

4628
03:30:55.660 --> 03:30:58.890 line:15%
This is work they had already continued from--

4629
03:30:58.890 --> 03:31:00.350 line:15%
Well, it's mostly Caleb.
You are,

4630
03:31:00.350 --> 03:31:02.760 line:15%
you are both downplaying your contribution.

4631
03:31:02.760 --> 03:31:04.380 line:15%
Well, if we're going to be honest,

4632
03:31:04.380 --> 03:31:06.130 line:15%
the biggest contribution here is a

4633
03:31:07.320 --> 03:31:09.510 line:15%
mage long before our time.

4634
03:31:10.650 --> 03:31:12.230 line:15%
Oh, Halas.
True.

4635
03:31:13.850 --> 03:31:16.740 line:15%
True, standing on the shoulders of giants.

4636
03:31:16.740 --> 03:31:17.573 line:15%
Indeed.

4637
03:31:19.870 --> 03:31:21.590 line:15%
Very hard, they're very aggressive.

4638
03:31:21.590 --> 03:31:22.423 line:15%
Are we?

4639
03:31:22.423 --> 03:31:25.190 line:15%
If we were successful, yes, are you--

4640
03:31:25.190 --> 03:31:27.470 line:15%
Yeah, why aren't you, why aren't you already changed?

4641
03:31:27.470 --> 03:31:30.510 line:15%
I just, I just need to maybe let it sit for a second,

4642
03:31:30.510 --> 03:31:35.240 line:15%
just think about what this would, you know.

4643
03:31:35.240 --> 03:31:36.190 line:15%
I'm going to do it.

4644
03:31:36.190 --> 03:31:37.890 line:15%
Of course, I'll do it, I'll do it,

4645
03:31:38.818 --> 03:31:40.890 line:15%
I just, you know, where there's risks involved.

4646
03:31:40.890 --> 03:31:42.920 line:15%
We've never done it before.
Yeah, what is the risk?

4647
03:31:42.920 --> 03:31:44.670 line:15%
What happens if it's not successful?

4648
03:31:44.670 --> 03:31:46.200 line:15%
Who knows?
Do you accidentally

4649
03:31:46.200 --> 03:31:48.610 line:15%
turn into a wooly mammoth or something?

4650
03:31:49.580 --> 03:31:52.070 line:15%
I don't think so, there's not enough clay for that.

4651
03:31:52.070 --> 03:31:53.390 line:15%
Gathering looking at the equation,

4652
03:31:53.390 --> 03:31:56.910 line:15%
if done correctly, there's no drawback

4653
03:31:56.910 --> 03:31:59.240 line:15%
beyond just the cost of materials lost.

4654
03:31:59.240 --> 03:32:00.073 line:15%
Wow.

4655
03:32:00.073 --> 03:32:01.860 line:15%
Yeah, but, I mean, we don't know that, right?

4656
03:32:01.860 --> 03:32:03.340 line:15%
We don't know, so.
Oh,

4657
03:32:03.340 --> 03:32:08.170 line:15%
do any of you have crushed gem dust left?

4658
03:32:08.170 --> 03:32:09.490 line:15%
We did have some.
I'll have to take a look.

4659
03:32:09.490 --> 03:32:13.960 line:15%
We did, we used a lot of it for, you know, our tattoos.

4660
03:32:16.200 --> 03:32:19.892 line:15%
Don't need much, about a hundred gold pieces worth.

4661
03:32:19.892 --> 03:32:22.210 line:15%
Can't be that hard to find.
No.

4662
03:32:22.210 --> 03:32:25.200 line:15%
I have a diamond worth 50 gold.

4663
03:32:26.640 --> 03:32:28.990 line:15%
We don't have any dust left

4664
03:32:30.480 --> 03:32:33.360 line:15%
but we can find some.
That shouldn't be too hard.

4665
03:32:33.360 --> 03:32:34.193 line:15%
Certainly.

4666
03:32:34.193 --> 03:32:36.380 line:15%
And it seems like you want to, you know,

4667
03:32:36.380 --> 03:32:39.430 line:15%
just prepare yourself because it's been so long--

4668
03:32:39.430 --> 03:32:40.670 line:15%
Well also, we don't have any, we don't have

4669
03:32:40.670 --> 03:32:42.780 line:15%
the materials so we can't do it now anyway.

4670
03:32:42.780 --> 03:32:44.290 line:15%
What are the materials needed?

4671
03:32:44.290 --> 03:32:45.970 line:15%
We need clay, which Essek is saying

4672
03:32:45.970 --> 03:32:49.120 line:15%
he could provide for us.
A lot of clay, yeah.

4673
03:32:49.120 --> 03:32:49.953 line:15%
Okay.

4674
03:32:49.953 --> 03:32:51.530 line:15%
Which he could provide to us.

4675
03:32:51.530 --> 03:32:53.400 line:15%
And then we would need to get some gemstone dust,

4676
03:32:53.400 --> 03:32:55.300 line:15%
which either we have some or, um,

4677
03:32:56.932 --> 03:32:59.363 line:15%
this is a very large, beautiful city,

4678
03:32:59.363 --> 03:33:00.196 line:15%
I'm sure that we could acquire some.

4679
03:33:00.196 --> 03:33:03.180 line:15%
Do you need to be here in order to perform this spell

4680
03:33:03.180 --> 03:33:04.370 line:15%
or is it something you want to--

4681
03:33:04.370 --> 03:33:05.550 line:15%
I don't think so.

4682
03:33:05.550 --> 03:33:06.780 line:15%
Travel with and--

4683
03:33:08.690 --> 03:33:10.290 line:15%
That's a lot of, I don't know.

4684
03:33:11.200 --> 03:33:12.490 line:15%
Well--
So you can get clay.

4685
03:33:13.493 --> 03:33:15.870 line:15%
I would recommend doing it--

4686
03:33:17.610 --> 03:33:18.860 line:15%
Controlled.
Doing it here or somewhere,

4687
03:33:18.860 --> 03:33:20.360 line:15%
yes, a controlled environment.

4688
03:33:21.650 --> 03:33:23.400 line:15%
How long do you need?
An hour?

4689
03:33:24.777 --> 03:33:26.398 line:15%
Wow.
I know, right?

4690
03:33:26.398 --> 03:33:28.790 line:15%
No but you could do it right now.

4691
03:33:28.790 --> 03:33:31.230 line:15%
We just go out, probably, just go out

4692
03:33:31.230 --> 03:33:33.330 line:15%
and get some gem dust while people start digging.

4693
03:33:33.330 --> 03:33:34.163 line:15%
Yeah.

4694
03:33:34.163 --> 03:33:36.650 line:15%
Do you want to go source another 50 gold of gems

4695
03:33:36.650 --> 03:33:40.270 line:15%
and I could assist Essek and certainly Caduceus could

4696
03:33:40.270 --> 03:33:43.050 line:15%
help us gather how much, how much clay in particular?

4697
03:33:43.050 --> 03:33:44.280 line:15%
Lots of clay?
50 pounds.

4698
03:33:44.280 --> 03:33:46.580 line:15%
50 pounds, right?
Oh, that's not too bad.

4699
03:33:47.530 --> 03:33:51.790 line:15%
Nott, I feel like you're hesitant.

4700
03:33:51.790 --> 03:33:53.880 line:15%
Well yeah, I mean, of course.

4701
03:33:53.880 --> 03:33:56.260 line:15%
It's just been a long time coming.

4702
03:33:56.260 --> 03:33:59.990 line:15%
I didn't think, like, this morning would be the time.

4703
03:34:01.990 --> 03:34:05.200 line:15%
I sort of assumed that it would be an ordeal

4704
03:34:05.200 --> 03:34:08.650 line:15%
and I'd have to die or something to do it again.

4705
03:34:10.060 --> 03:34:12.260 line:15%
And so, it's, it's just odd that it's so--

4706
03:34:13.100 --> 03:34:15.490 line:15%
Doable?
Easy.

4707
03:34:15.490 --> 03:34:19.250 line:15%
Well, after months of traveling together

4708
03:34:19.250 --> 03:34:20.083 line:15%
and--
Wow.

4709
03:34:23.828 --> 03:34:26.330 line:15%
I mean, you already died once.

4710
03:34:26.330 --> 03:34:28.650 line:15%
No, I don't want to die again, trust me.

4711
03:34:28.650 --> 03:34:29.483 line:15%
I just, uh.

4712
03:34:33.457 --> 03:34:35.080 line:15%
Are you kind of used to being in this body now?

4713
03:34:35.080 --> 03:34:36.830 line:15%
No, I hate this body, it's awful.

4714
03:34:37.710 --> 03:34:41.600 line:15%
It's just, what do I, you know, what do I do after?

4715
03:34:41.600 --> 03:34:43.860 line:15%
You stay with us for a little bit.

4716
03:34:43.860 --> 03:34:46.430 line:15%
You help us keep doing what we are doing,

4717
03:34:46.430 --> 03:34:48.070 line:15%
you just look different.

4718
03:34:48.070 --> 03:34:50.450 line:15%
Why would I do that?
Because you love us.

4719
03:34:51.598 --> 03:34:53.870 line:15%
Are you afraid that if you

4720
03:34:53.870 --> 03:34:57.500 line:15%
get your old body back that it means--

4721
03:34:59.511 --> 03:35:04.480 line:15%
You got to go leave us and go back to Yeza and your son?

4722
03:35:04.480 --> 03:35:07.700 line:15%
Because that's, like, totally a manifested condition

4723
03:35:07.700 --> 03:35:09.550 line:15%
that you're putting on the situation.

4724
03:35:11.531 --> 03:35:12.600 line:15%
Not really.
But also, I understand.

4725
03:35:12.600 --> 03:35:15.260 line:15%
It is important, you know, you have a son.

4726
03:35:15.260 --> 03:35:16.820 line:15%
No, I know.
He misses you.

4727
03:35:16.820 --> 03:35:17.653 line:15%
I know.

4728
03:35:19.020 --> 03:35:20.520 line:15%
That is a--
It's hard for a--

4729
03:35:20.520 --> 03:35:22.000 line:15%
Conundrum.
Hard for

4730
03:35:22.000 --> 03:35:24.260 line:15%
a son to be away from a mother.

4731
03:35:24.260 --> 03:35:26.750 line:15%
I want to be there.
What about this?

4732
03:35:28.840 --> 03:35:33.330 line:15%
You've done so much with us and it feels like we're close

4733
03:35:33.330 --> 03:35:38.220 line:15%
to achieving a historic peace treaty between two nations.

4734
03:35:38.220 --> 03:35:40.870 line:15%
Maybe that's the punctuation mark you're looking for?

4735
03:35:42.820 --> 03:35:45.070 line:15%
Yeah, like one last run.
Yeah.

4736
03:35:45.070 --> 03:35:47.030 line:15%
Traveler Con?
The last chapter in--

4737
03:35:47.030 --> 03:35:48.250 line:15%
Really important.
This book

4738
03:35:48.250 --> 03:35:51.370 line:15%
of adventures for you.
Getting your body back

4739
03:35:51.370 --> 03:35:53.870 line:15%
just doesn't have to be a final pin in the story,

4740
03:35:53.870 --> 03:35:56.890 line:15%
is all I'm trying to say.
We certainly need you.

4741
03:35:56.890 --> 03:35:59.100 line:15%
We'd be shortsighted.

4742
03:35:59.100 --> 03:36:02.520 line:15%
But we, you, (sighs) you know, we wouldn't,

4743
03:36:03.762 --> 03:36:06.820 line:15%
(sighs) judge you if you wanted to stay with us for awhile.

4744
03:36:07.900 --> 03:36:09.400 line:15%
Or if you wanted to go home.

4745
03:36:10.720 --> 03:36:13.840 line:15%
Yeah, but if you wanted to stay with us for awhile.

4746
03:36:13.840 --> 03:36:15.500 line:15%
Yeah, I, I do.

4747
03:36:17.440 --> 03:36:18.273 line:15%
Of course I do.

4748
03:36:19.670 --> 03:36:20.503 line:15%
I just don't,

4749
03:36:23.330 --> 03:36:24.163 line:15%
I want,

4750
03:36:25.290 --> 03:36:26.770 line:15%
what I want is

4751
03:36:28.840 --> 03:36:32.610 line:15%
just contrary to what, what we've been doing,

4752
03:36:32.610 --> 03:36:34.860 line:15%
and so it's just a bit of a change, you know?

4753
03:36:36.280 --> 03:36:37.113 line:15%
Um.

4754
03:36:38.850 --> 03:36:40.810 line:15%
I mean, yeah, you're right, I suppose I could just

4755
03:36:40.810 --> 03:36:44.240 line:15%
change, you know, just change my body, right,

4756
03:36:44.240 --> 03:36:48.210 line:15%
and then continue on with you guys just for a little bit,

4757
03:36:48.210 --> 03:36:51.690 line:15%
until we come to a,

4758
03:36:51.690 --> 03:36:52.640 line:15%
a spot where,

4759
03:36:54.780 --> 03:36:55.940 line:15%
where that's it.

4760
03:36:55.940 --> 03:37:00.930 line:15%
Well, you know we would, um, be ensuring peace

4761
03:37:03.240 --> 03:37:04.700 line:15%
for your family, for your son,

4762
03:37:04.700 --> 03:37:07.720 line:15%
for the Empire, if we pull this off.

4763
03:37:07.720 --> 03:37:10.340 line:15%
That is commendable.

4764
03:37:12.670 --> 03:37:13.503 line:15%
Yeah.

4765
03:37:16.730 --> 03:37:17.563 line:15%
Uh, yeah.

4766
03:37:20.050 --> 03:37:20.950 line:15%
Let's do it, then.

4767
03:37:26.550 --> 03:37:27.600 line:15%
Um, Nott, could you

4768
03:37:30.860 --> 03:37:32.580 line:15%
show us what you looked like?

4769
03:37:35.460 --> 03:37:36.984 line:15%
Yeah, of course.

4770
03:37:36.984 --> 03:37:37.817 line:15%
Uh.

4771
03:37:40.000 --> 03:37:43.680 line:15%
Yeah, I'll transform into Veth.

4772
03:37:43.680 --> 03:37:46.460 line:15%
And you've seen Veth in the illusion

4773
03:37:46.460 --> 03:37:49.080 line:15%
of Veth before many times.

4774
03:37:49.080 --> 03:37:50.640 line:15%
A very clear vision of the beautiful

4775
03:37:50.640 --> 03:37:53.372 line:15%
half-elf girl, sorry, halfling girl.

4776
03:37:53.372 --> 03:37:56.476 line:15%
Mm-hmm.

4777
03:37:56.476 --> 03:37:57.440 line:15%
(sighs) Hi.
Hi.

4778
03:37:58.750 --> 03:38:01.270 line:15%
Caleb, a little shaky, but walks around

4779
03:38:01.270 --> 03:38:05.730 line:15%
and just gets every detail and angle.

4780
03:38:05.730 --> 03:38:08.290 line:15%
Do you have to do this?

4781
03:38:08.290 --> 03:38:10.010 line:15%
You have to do this.

4782
03:38:10.010 --> 03:38:12.970 line:15%
The spellcaster has to choose the form,

4783
03:38:14.400 --> 03:38:15.620 line:15%
is that how this works?

4784
03:38:16.620 --> 03:38:17.560 line:15%
I would think so.

4785
03:38:17.560 --> 03:38:19.530 line:15%
It's kind of a combination of the two.

4786
03:38:20.650 --> 03:38:22.310 line:15%
If the spellcaster wants, it can be

4787
03:38:22.310 --> 03:38:25.120 line:15%
entirely of their making,

4788
03:38:27.753 --> 03:38:31.970 line:15%
but it could be a mutual agreed upon scenario.

4789
03:38:31.970 --> 03:38:35.950 line:15%
It's the idea between, the spell, in theory,

4790
03:38:35.950 --> 03:38:40.070 line:15%
could be put upon somebody without their consent.

4791
03:38:40.070 --> 03:38:42.170 line:15%
It might be what happened to her before?

4792
03:38:43.251 --> 03:38:45.251 line:15%
It was a different type of experience.

4793
03:38:46.240 --> 03:38:48.550 line:15%
So, in theory, the spell can be used

4794
03:38:48.550 --> 03:38:49.383 line:15%
to transform somebody against their will,

4795
03:38:49.383 --> 03:38:52.490 line:15%
but that would be, that would involve a saving throw.

4796
03:38:52.490 --> 03:38:53.730 line:15%
If it is a, it is something that

4797
03:38:53.730 --> 03:38:55.990 line:15%
you are consenting with the caster on,

4798
03:38:55.990 --> 03:38:58.200 line:15%
then the form can be agreed upon in essentially

4799
03:38:58.200 --> 03:39:01.440 line:15%
a shared vision and no saving throw required.

4800
03:39:02.348 --> 03:39:04.540 line:15%
We'll do what we always do, we'll do it together.

4801
03:39:04.540 --> 03:39:07.520 line:15%
Mm-hmm, yeah.
Caleb and Nott.

4802
03:39:09.250 --> 03:39:10.083 line:15%
All right.

4803
03:39:11.410 --> 03:39:14.510 line:15%
I guess, do you own a shovel?

4804
03:39:16.420 --> 03:39:20.630 line:15%
I have, I have a shovel.
You just carry it around?

4805
03:39:20.630 --> 03:39:22.400 line:15%
Where does it--
It's on my belt,

4806
03:39:22.400 --> 03:39:24.050 line:15%
it's just a little folding thing.

4807
03:39:24.050 --> 03:39:25.440 line:15%
Living in a cemetery.
Yeah.

4808
03:39:25.440 --> 03:39:26.810 line:15%
That's true.
Nott, we can,

4809
03:39:26.810 --> 03:39:29.120 line:15%
Caduceus and I can go to town.

4810
03:39:29.120 --> 03:39:31.566 line:15%
I can go find some gem dust for you.

4811
03:39:31.566 --> 03:39:34.050 line:15%
That would be nice.
I'll help team clay.

4812
03:39:35.333 --> 03:39:36.514 line:15%
Yeah.

4813
03:39:36.514 --> 03:39:38.020 line:15%
Think you can find some gem dust with me, Fjord?

4814
03:39:38.020 --> 03:39:38.860 line:15%
Sure, yeah.
Yeah, he can't dig,

4815
03:39:38.860 --> 03:39:40.970 line:15%
so, yeah.
What?

4816
03:39:40.970 --> 03:39:45.007 line:15%
I mean, come on.
Oh.

4817
03:39:45.007 --> 03:39:46.860 line:15%
(laughter)

4818
03:39:46.860 --> 03:39:48.491 line:15%
(clapping)

4819
03:39:48.491 --> 03:39:50.741 line:15%
(laughter)

4820
03:39:51.766 --> 03:39:54.933 line:15%
I will go with Jester, find some gems.

4821
03:39:57.397 --> 03:40:00.917 line:15%
I will find nothing but cubic zirconia for your bitch ass.

4822
03:40:00.917 --> 03:40:02.450 line:15%
(laughter)

4823
03:40:02.450 --> 03:40:04.266 line:15%
She comes out like a Picasso.

4824
03:40:04.266 --> 03:40:05.186 line:15%
(laughter)

4825
03:40:05.186 --> 03:40:06.167 line:15%
I don't know why it didn't work!

4826
03:40:06.167 --> 03:40:08.417 line:15%
(laughter)

4827
03:40:09.560 --> 03:40:11.150 line:15%
It's an easy enough shopping trip

4828
03:40:11.150 --> 03:40:13.710 line:15%
since the gems themselves are not specific,

4829
03:40:13.710 --> 03:40:15.250 line:15%
it's just a certain worth of it.

4830
03:40:16.287 --> 03:40:17.220 line:15%
Once again, requesting them crushed up

4831
03:40:17.220 --> 03:40:19.540 line:15%
by another jeweler is a unique reaction,

4832
03:40:19.540 --> 03:40:22.350 line:15%
but you acquire the gem dust easy enough.

4833
03:40:23.280 --> 03:40:26.460 line:15%
Through the rapid conjuring of water

4834
03:40:26.460 --> 03:40:31.080 line:15%
and the group aid, you are able to

4835
03:40:31.080 --> 03:40:34.050 line:15%
both help facilitate and excise

4836
03:40:34.050 --> 03:40:38.020 line:15%
enough clay to facilitate the spell.

4837
03:40:40.080 --> 03:40:43.030 line:15%
Within less than an hour, the materials have been gathered.

4838
03:40:45.030 --> 03:40:46.710 line:15%
What time of day is it?

4839
03:40:46.710 --> 03:40:50.050 line:15%
At this point, early afternoon.

4840
03:40:50.050 --> 03:40:51.420 line:15%
Yeah, about early afternoon,

4841
03:40:51.420 --> 03:40:53.120 line:15%
two o'clock, three o'clock, maybe.

4842
03:40:54.589 --> 03:40:55.422 line:15%
You want to do this right now

4843
03:40:55.422 --> 03:40:57.227 line:15%
or you still want to sleep on it?

4844
03:40:57.227 --> 03:40:59.496 line:15%
(gentle music)

4845
03:40:59.496 --> 03:41:00.810 line:15%
I mean, it's the best place to do it,

4846
03:41:00.810 --> 03:41:04.380 line:15%
in a powerful mage's tower, right?

4847
03:41:04.380 --> 03:41:06.000 line:15%
We don't have to leave town immediately

4848
03:41:06.000 --> 03:41:07.710 line:15%
if you wanted to stay here and sleep on it.

4849
03:41:07.710 --> 03:41:12.090 line:15%
There's no judgment, you don't need to make this decision

4850
03:41:12.090 --> 03:41:13.969 line:15%
right away.
Yeah.

4851
03:41:13.969 --> 03:41:15.770 line:15%
You should do it when it feels right, too.

4852
03:41:15.770 --> 03:41:16.920 line:15%
Yasha, you all right?

4853
03:41:17.790 --> 03:41:20.290 line:15%
I don't know why, this is making me weirdly sad.

4854
03:41:22.385 --> 03:41:23.380 line:15%
I mean, yeah.

4855
03:41:25.120 --> 03:41:26.273 line:15%
This has been, uh,

4856
03:41:29.784 --> 03:41:31.353 line:15%
we've had adventures together

4857
03:41:31.353 --> 03:41:34.760 line:15%
and loss and success and

4858
03:41:36.703 --> 03:41:39.400 line:15%
I don't know how I'll be after this, you know?

4859
03:41:39.400 --> 03:41:42.100 line:15%
I guess, in a weird way, you are,

4860
03:41:43.650 --> 03:41:46.580 line:15%
a version of you is dying

4861
03:41:49.270 --> 03:41:50.570 line:15%
in order to complete this.

4862
03:41:52.330 --> 03:41:53.480 line:15%
I don't know if I'll,

4863
03:41:55.943 --> 03:41:56.820 line:15%
I mean, I won't look the same,

4864
03:41:56.820 --> 03:41:58.020 line:15%
obviously, but I don't know if

4865
03:41:58.020 --> 03:42:02.390 line:15%
I'll think the same about you all.

4866
03:42:03.960 --> 03:42:04.793 line:15%
Why wouldn't you?

4867
03:42:04.793 --> 03:42:06.590 line:15%
You're the same you.
I don't know that.

4868
03:42:06.590 --> 03:42:08.080 line:15%
Just your body's going to be different.

4869
03:42:08.080 --> 03:42:09.303 line:15%
I don't know that.

4870
03:42:09.303 --> 03:42:11.886 line:15%
(gentle music)

4871
03:42:13.690 --> 03:42:16.870 line:15%
I've had all sorts of different feelings

4872
03:42:16.870 --> 03:42:20.770 line:15%
and things happen to me since becoming this form

4873
03:42:20.770 --> 03:42:22.510 line:15%
and I don't know what's what anymore.

4874
03:42:22.510 --> 03:42:23.343 line:15%
It all feels,

4875
03:42:25.140 --> 03:42:26.690 line:15%
I don't know, normal now.

4876
03:42:27.707 --> 03:42:31.190 line:15%
You treat me normal, everyone around here treats me normal.

4877
03:42:33.350 --> 03:42:34.717 line:15%
That's because you are.

4878
03:42:37.920 --> 03:42:40.500 line:15%
It's just which normal you want.

4879
03:42:40.500 --> 03:42:41.333 line:15%
Yeah.

4880
03:42:42.890 --> 03:42:46.970 line:15%
But what if I'm not as agile, nimble?

4881
03:42:47.930 --> 03:42:52.930 line:15%
What if I can't aim as quickly or hide as easily?

4882
03:42:53.850 --> 03:42:56.013 line:15%
Your aim's kind of iffy anyway, I--

4883
03:42:57.150 --> 03:43:00.177 line:15%
Wish I'd have got another one of those explosive ones.

4884
03:43:00.177 --> 03:43:01.048 line:15%
(chuckling)

4885
03:43:01.048 --> 03:43:03.110 line:15%
Kind of glad you don't.
If you trade out

4886
03:43:03.110 --> 03:43:07.420 line:15%
a few traits, you're not going to be left without.

4887
03:43:10.970 --> 03:43:12.390 line:15%
Are you sure about that?

4888
03:43:12.390 --> 03:43:14.490 line:15%
You will be a member of The Mighty Nein.

4889
03:43:16.340 --> 03:43:17.650 line:15%
You will be our friend.

4890
03:43:20.380 --> 03:43:24.100 line:15%
Not if I can't shoot or I can't pick locks or--

4891
03:43:26.280 --> 03:43:28.080 line:15%
I think I know what you're saying.

4892
03:43:31.400 --> 03:43:35.310 line:15%
I had to make a choice and it changed everything,

4893
03:43:35.310 --> 03:43:37.460 line:15%
no certainty of what was on the other side.

4894
03:43:38.490 --> 03:43:42.000 line:15%
You've been trying so hard to get to this point

4895
03:43:42.000 --> 03:43:43.550 line:15%
and you have the ability now.

4896
03:43:44.500 --> 03:43:47.500 line:15%
There's no reason for you to do it immediately.

4897
03:43:47.500 --> 03:43:49.980 line:15%
Unless you absolutely are sure you want to

4898
03:43:49.980 --> 03:43:52.920 line:15%
and the time is right, then you shouldn't.

4899
03:43:54.440 --> 03:43:56.930 line:15%
Otherwise, that uncertainty could lead to regret

4900
03:43:57.910 --> 03:44:00.190 line:15%
or anything else that you couldn't predict.

4901
03:44:00.190 --> 03:44:01.440 line:15%
Wait if you're not ready.

4902
03:44:02.890 --> 03:44:03.840 line:15%
We're here for you.

4903
03:44:05.006 --> 03:44:07.589 line:15%
(gentle music)

4904
03:44:13.210 --> 03:44:15.420 line:15%
I guess the thing I'm most scared of is if,

4905
03:44:16.810 --> 03:44:21.810 line:15%
right after I change, I won't want to stay.

4906
03:44:21.836 --> 03:44:24.419 line:15%
(gentle music)

4907
03:44:25.626 --> 03:44:27.793 line:15%
(sighing)

4908
03:44:29.404 --> 03:44:32.071 line:15%
Well, that would be okay, too.

4909
03:44:33.489 --> 03:44:35.239 line:15%
Nott, I don't think any of us can

4910
03:44:37.820 --> 03:44:39.770 line:15%
give you that answer and you know that,

4911
03:44:40.830 --> 03:44:42.230 line:15%
but whatever you want to do,

4912
03:44:45.400 --> 03:44:46.739 line:15%
we're here.

4913
03:44:46.739 --> 03:44:49.322 line:15%
(gentle music)

4914
03:44:54.860 --> 03:44:55.710 line:15%
I love you all.

4915
03:44:59.170 --> 03:45:00.602 line:15%
Let's do it.

4916
03:45:00.602 --> 03:45:03.185 line:15%
(gentle music)

4917
03:45:08.690 --> 03:45:11.660 line:15%
Do you want bigger tits this time around?

4918
03:45:11.660 --> 03:45:13.810 line:15%
Yep.
They're really big, I mean.

4919
03:45:15.000 --> 03:45:17.330 line:15%
Every man likes even a little bigger.

4920
03:45:17.330 --> 03:45:19.110 line:15%
I don't think that's necessarily true.

4921
03:45:19.110 --> 03:45:21.510 line:15%
Well, yes it does--
He likes big--

4922
03:45:21.510 --> 03:45:24.460 line:15%
Make them how you want them, don't do it for anybody else.

4923
03:45:25.400 --> 03:45:26.900 line:15%
You know what, you're right.

4924
03:45:27.770 --> 03:45:29.160 line:15%
It'll hurt my back.

4925
03:45:29.160 --> 03:45:30.900 line:15%
I'll just make them a little smaller.

4926
03:45:30.900 --> 03:45:32.890 line:15%
You might be more agile

4927
03:45:32.890 --> 03:45:33.730 line:15%
if they're--
Make them however

4928
03:45:33.730 --> 03:45:35.080 line:15%
you want it to be.
Yeah.

4929
03:45:37.801 --> 03:45:40.550 line:15%
I mean, titties are just great, regardless.

4930
03:45:40.550 --> 03:45:41.550 line:15%
Yeah.
For sure.

4931
03:45:42.790 --> 03:45:43.810 line:15%
All shapes and sizes are good.

4932
03:45:43.810 --> 03:45:45.370 line:15%
Yeah.
Yeah.

4933
03:45:45.370 --> 03:45:47.400 line:15%
Small ones, big ones, dangly ones.

4934
03:45:47.400 --> 03:45:49.520 line:15%
I'll mold your titties, if you

4935
03:45:49.520 --> 03:45:51.240 line:15%
want me to be in charge of that.

4936
03:45:51.240 --> 03:45:52.130 line:15%
You'll mold my titties?

4937
03:45:52.130 --> 03:45:53.460 line:15%
Well, I'm assuming we have to make, like,

4938
03:45:53.460 --> 03:45:56.180 line:15%
a clay version of the view you want to turn into.

4939
03:45:56.180 --> 03:45:58.370 line:15%
I'm totally just making this shit up.

4940
03:45:58.370 --> 03:45:59.931 line:15%
That's not all how it works.

4941
03:45:59.931 --> 03:46:01.810 line:15%
(laughter)

4942
03:46:01.810 --> 03:46:04.690 line:15%
If that is the case, then I absolutely

4943
03:46:04.690 --> 03:46:07.800 line:15%
want Beau to mold my titties and no one else

4944
03:46:07.800 --> 03:46:10.310 line:15%
because she has the most experience with them.

4945
03:46:10.310 --> 03:46:11.561 line:15%
(laughter)

4946
03:46:11.561 --> 03:46:12.710 line:15%
And she's got deft, deft

4947
03:46:12.710 --> 03:46:13.543 line:15%
fingers and hands--
That might not

4948
03:46:13.543 --> 03:46:14.801 line:15%
entirely be true.

4949
03:46:14.801 --> 03:46:16.346 line:15%
(laughter)
(clapping)

4950
03:46:16.346 --> 03:46:17.179 line:15%
Oh!
Do tell.

4951
03:46:17.179 --> 03:46:19.217 line:15%
(laughter)
(clapping)

4952
03:46:19.217 --> 03:46:21.420 line:15%
That's a story for another time.

4953
03:46:21.420 --> 03:46:22.970 line:15%
We'll swap titty tales.

4954
03:46:22.970 --> 03:46:24.120 line:15%
Her name was Crayola.

4955
03:46:26.268 --> 03:46:27.766 line:15%
Her name was Cerulean.

4956
03:46:27.766 --> 03:46:30.256 line:15%
(laughter)

4957
03:46:30.256 --> 03:46:32.589 line:15%
(chuckling)

4958
03:46:35.800 --> 03:46:36.633 line:15%
I suppose I will go prepare

4959
03:46:36.633 --> 03:46:40.320 line:15%
the chamber, and um. (clears throat)

4960
03:46:42.007 --> 03:46:45.020 line:15%
And he goes ahead and lifts a hand towards the hunk of clay.

4961
03:46:47.580 --> 03:46:50.970 line:15%
"If I could have some help?"
Hmm, yeah, right.

4962
03:46:50.970 --> 03:46:52.400 line:15%
You lift it and it's half the weight

4963
03:46:52.400 --> 03:46:55.770 line:15%
it was before you grabbed it.

4964
03:46:55.770 --> 03:46:58.700 line:15%
"Come."
Is that right?

4965
03:46:58.700 --> 03:47:00.039 line:15%
Heading upstairs.
All right.

4966
03:47:00.039 --> 03:47:03.910 line:15%
Is that right? (laughs)
It feels light, but.

4967
03:47:06.920 --> 03:47:08.740 line:15%
You all follow?
Yeah.

4968
03:47:08.740 --> 03:47:09.640 line:15%
Yeah, of course.

4969
03:47:11.720 --> 03:47:13.980 line:15%
Heading back into the research chamber

4970
03:47:13.980 --> 03:47:16.000 line:15%
where you had completed this equation,

4971
03:47:17.090 --> 03:47:20.070 line:15%
you begin setting up exactly the ritual that

4972
03:47:20.070 --> 03:47:23.740 line:15%
you had partially uncovered, partially designed.

4973
03:47:25.210 --> 03:47:27.280 line:15%
Arranging all manner of materials,

4974
03:47:27.280 --> 03:47:30.570 line:15%
taking the clay itself and molding it into

4975
03:47:30.570 --> 03:47:33.870 line:15%
essentially a small trough, if you will,

4976
03:47:35.760 --> 03:47:40.120 line:15%
to contain Nott as part of the ritual.

4977
03:47:42.370 --> 03:47:44.820 line:15%
Eventually, you set up the right incense to burn,

4978
03:47:46.010 --> 03:47:49.110 line:15%
the light in the chamber is closed with a curtain,

4979
03:47:49.110 --> 03:47:52.700 line:15%
and as you finish preparations,

4980
03:47:52.700 --> 03:47:54.400 line:15%
it is set for the hour ritual.

4981
03:47:57.760 --> 03:48:00.990 line:15%
I crouch down before her.

4982
03:48:02.870 --> 03:48:03.703 line:15%
"Nott the Brave,

4983
03:48:06.660 --> 03:48:07.493 line:15%
"Veth Brenatto,

4984
03:48:09.660 --> 03:48:11.140 line:15%
"you are here."

4985
03:48:11.140 --> 03:48:12.790 line:15%
And he taps just above her heart.

4986
03:48:14.760 --> 03:48:16.279 line:15%
"And you are here."

4987
03:48:16.279 --> 03:48:17.929 line:15%
He touches just between her eyes.

4988
03:48:20.580 --> 03:48:24.650 line:15%
"You are you and you will continue to be you.

4989
03:48:28.360 --> 03:48:29.210 line:15%
"And we are here.

4990
03:48:32.010 --> 03:48:32.843 line:15%
"You ready?"

4991
03:48:34.556 --> 03:48:36.723 line:15%
(sighing)

4992
03:48:39.660 --> 03:48:44.660 line:15%
I'll just, I lean forward and sweetly kiss him on the lips

4993
03:48:48.110 --> 03:48:53.110 line:15%
and say, "Thank you, Caleb, for getting me this far

4994
03:48:55.674 --> 03:48:58.753 line:15%
"and for devoting yourself to, to me.

4995
03:49:03.130 --> 03:49:04.030 line:15%
"You're a good man

4996
03:49:09.050 --> 03:49:14.050 line:15%
"and I, I hope you find to where you're going, too."

4997
03:49:21.414 --> 03:49:22.320 line:15%
(sighing)

4998
03:49:22.320 --> 03:49:25.220 line:15%
All right, do the thing.

4999
03:49:26.450 --> 03:49:27.900 line:15%
Cups the side of her cheek.

5000
03:49:29.010 --> 03:49:30.710 line:15%
"This will be our best trick yet."

5001
03:49:32.135 --> 03:49:33.030 line:15%
We have to name it.

5002
03:49:35.220 --> 03:49:37.830 line:15%
Preparing, as you pull the sleeves back,

5003
03:49:37.830 --> 03:49:41.010 line:15%
you take the scattered elements of the crushed gems

5004
03:49:41.010 --> 03:49:43.660 line:15%
and place them across Nott's body

5005
03:49:45.965 --> 03:49:47.640 line:15%
as you lay down into the clay.
That's wet.

5006
03:49:48.710 --> 03:49:53.710 line:15%
The ritual begins as the lines begin to

5007
03:49:54.440 --> 03:49:57.610 line:15%
draw around, the incantations begin.

5008
03:49:57.610 --> 03:49:59.210 line:15%
All of you sit back and watch

5009
03:49:59.210 --> 03:50:00.710 line:15%
as the wind begins to pick up.

5010
03:50:01.870 --> 03:50:03.190 line:15%
The temperature shifts and alters,

5011
03:50:03.190 --> 03:50:05.450 line:15%
the cold of the clay heats around your body,

5012
03:50:05.450 --> 03:50:07.400 line:15%
and you feel it begin to actually move.

5013
03:50:10.817 --> 03:50:11.650 line:15%
You watch as the clay begins to slowly

5014
03:50:11.650 --> 03:50:12.483 line:15%
almost melt in reverse, upward,

5015
03:50:12.483 --> 03:50:15.133 line:15%
and then eventually encasing elements of Nott's body.

5016
03:50:16.610 --> 03:50:19.340 line:15%
As the magic begins to swirl and gather,

5017
03:50:20.620 --> 03:50:23.720 line:15%
minutes seem to stretch longer than you expected.

5018
03:50:24.860 --> 03:50:27.110 line:15%
It's a place where time momentarily

5019
03:50:27.110 --> 03:50:30.890 line:15%
seems to not really have an impact.

5020
03:50:30.890 --> 03:50:33.230 line:15%
Words you try and speak draw out slowly.

5021
03:50:34.410 --> 03:50:37.590 line:15%
As part of this ritual, it's an encapsulation within itself

5022
03:50:37.590 --> 03:50:39.880 line:15%
and all of you are just bystanders

5023
03:50:39.880 --> 03:50:42.280 line:15%
watching a new magic be birthed.

5024
03:50:44.820 --> 03:50:46.380 line:15%
As you progress, you reach out

5025
03:50:46.380 --> 03:50:50.280 line:15%
and extend your thoughts towards Nott,

5026
03:50:50.280 --> 03:50:52.980 line:15%
and Nott, you concentrate and focus on

5027
03:50:52.980 --> 03:50:55.730 line:15%
the image of who you truly are, in the heart of hearts.

5028
03:50:57.220 --> 03:51:02.220 line:15%
As you feel the clay begin to cool and turn cold around you,

5029
03:51:03.400 --> 03:51:06.030 line:15%
you engage the second element of the spell.

5030
03:51:06.030 --> 03:51:09.190 line:15%
Now, the woven threads of arcane power

5031
03:51:09.190 --> 03:51:12.160 line:15%
pierce the clay and pierce Nott's body

5032
03:51:13.000 --> 03:51:14.900 line:15%
to begin the process of rearrangement.

5033
03:51:16.740 --> 03:51:18.880 line:15%
Excitement begins to flow through you at the knowledge

5034
03:51:18.880 --> 03:51:21.930 line:15%
that you have the ability at your fingertips to do this,

5035
03:51:21.930 --> 03:51:24.350 line:15%
after so many times of discussing

5036
03:51:24.350 --> 03:51:26.750 line:15%
and contemplating and daydreaming.

5037
03:51:26.750 --> 03:51:29.340 line:15%
This is the moment where you are the surgeon at work.

5038
03:51:31.895 --> 03:51:34.640 line:15%
And you go in for that first incision

5039
03:51:37.770 --> 03:51:38.720 line:15%
and you're blocked.

5040
03:51:43.841 --> 03:51:45.070 line:15%
And you pull and it should be working

5041
03:51:45.070 --> 03:51:46.970 line:15%
and you push again and you're blocked.

5042
03:51:48.850 --> 03:51:50.680 line:15%
There's something dark, something in the way,

5043
03:51:50.680 --> 03:51:53.690 line:15%
and you don't know what it is and it's frustrating.

5044
03:51:53.690 --> 03:51:55.880 line:15%
You shake your head and tense your eyes

5045
03:51:55.880 --> 03:51:59.200 line:15%
and as you push a third time, it pushes back.

5046
03:51:59.200 --> 03:52:02.520 line:15%
All of you watch as the clay suddenly cracks,

5047
03:52:02.520 --> 03:52:05.950 line:15%
shatters across the room, sending shards everywhere,

5048
03:52:05.950 --> 03:52:07.960 line:15%
you're having to block your eyes.

5049
03:52:07.960 --> 03:52:10.490 line:15%
The window blasts open a little bit.

5050
03:52:10.490 --> 03:52:12.320 line:15%
The spell itself, the ritual,

5051
03:52:12.320 --> 03:52:14.950 line:15%
the containment field of energy suddenly drops.

5052
03:52:15.970 --> 03:52:18.470 line:15%
All you hear, between the two of you,

5053
03:52:18.470 --> 03:52:22.930 line:15%
as the shadow that encases Nott, is this terrible laugh.

5054
03:52:24.686 --> 03:52:26.936 line:15%
(cackling)

5055
03:52:30.790 --> 03:52:33.350 line:15%
All that you recall is the last time

5056
03:52:34.856 --> 03:52:36.370 line:15%
you heard that laugh.
That motherfucker.

5057
03:52:36.370 --> 03:52:38.470 line:15%
When you were placed beneath that water.

5058
03:52:41.510 --> 03:52:44.180 line:15%
You've sensed this before, things like this,

5059
03:52:46.450 --> 03:52:50.320 line:15%
but lying deep in the heart of Nott's form

5060
03:52:50.320 --> 03:52:52.210 line:15%
lies a curse that still holds her,

5061
03:52:55.220 --> 03:53:00.220 line:15%
something that still grips her essence

5062
03:53:00.420 --> 03:53:03.370 line:15%
from whatever creature laid this fate upon her.

5063
03:53:07.053 --> 03:53:07.886 line:15%
And that's where we'll pick up next time.

5064
03:53:07.886 --> 03:53:10.010 line:15%
(groaning)

5065
03:53:10.010 --> 03:53:12.980 line:15%
Holy shit!
Oh.

5066
03:53:15.089 --> 03:53:16.290 line:15%
You've grazed her.

5067
03:53:17.309 --> 03:53:18.667 line:15%
The orbs of magic.

5068
03:53:18.667 --> 03:53:20.880 line:15%
(laughter)

5069
03:53:20.880 --> 03:53:21.713 line:15%
Holy moly.

5070
03:53:23.174 --> 03:53:24.265 line:15%
(exhaling)

5071
03:53:24.265 --> 03:53:28.153 line:15%
Okay, okay, okay.
Who was dis bitch?

5072
03:53:29.356 --> 03:53:30.816 line:15%
(laughter)

5073
03:53:30.816 --> 03:53:31.760 line:15%
I don't know.
I'm going to

5074
03:53:31.760 --> 03:53:33.200 line:15%

5075
03:53:33.200 --> 03:53:35.500 line:15%
We got to go this find this, this here witch.

5076
03:53:35.500 --> 03:53:36.333 line:15%
Yup, yup.

5077
03:53:38.568 --> 03:53:39.574 line:15%
Am I alive?
Are you okay?

5078
03:53:39.574 --> 03:53:40.801 line:15%
Where am I?
Are you there?

5079
03:53:40.801 --> 03:53:43.710 line:15%
You're encased in black what?

5080
03:53:43.710 --> 03:53:46.690 line:15%
To give you some--
We're back in, everybody.

5081
03:53:46.690 --> 03:53:49.070 line:15%
For the final moment to return to Nott.

5082
03:53:49.070 --> 03:53:51.763 line:15%
Yeah, no no, for the moment, when all of you

5083
03:53:51.763 --> 03:53:52.596 line:15%
look at this and realize the sound,

5084
03:53:52.596 --> 03:53:54.490 line:15%
that Nott, you are safe, you are fine,

5085
03:53:54.490 --> 03:53:55.690 line:15%
you are where you were sitting--

5086
03:53:55.690 --> 03:53:57.160
Am I alive?
You're alive,

5087
03:53:57.160 --> 03:53:58.990 line:15%
but you're still in your goblin body,

5088
03:53:58.990 --> 03:54:00.013 line:15%
unchanged.
Oh.

5089
03:54:04.036 --> 03:54:06.304 line:15%
So.
Who could hear the laugh?

5090
03:54:06.304 --> 03:54:07.137 line:15%
Just Caleb?
Just Caleb and Nott.

5091
03:54:07.137 --> 03:54:09.285 line:15%
The two that were directly connected as part of this ritual.

5092
03:54:09.285 --> 03:54:11.370 line:15%
Alive, spell thwarted.
Correct.

5093
03:54:11.370 --> 03:54:14.920 line:15%
And the components consumed but the spell thwarted

5094
03:54:14.920 --> 03:54:19.631 line:15%
by whatever, whatever strange curse still holds her.

5095
03:54:19.631 --> 03:54:24.010 line:15%
Ooh, he made you do the exercise

5096
03:54:24.010 --> 03:54:26.295 line:15%
and then ripped it from ya!

5097
03:54:26.295 --> 03:54:27.128 line:15%
(laughter)

5098
03:54:27.128 --> 03:54:28.670 line:15%
I wasn't ready to say bye to Nott.

5099
03:54:28.670 --> 03:54:29.770 line:15%
Whoa.
Oh, man.

5100
03:54:29.770 --> 03:54:34.018 line:15%
Your eyes got all red and teary and it went, "Fuck you."

5101
03:54:34.018 --> 03:54:36.268 line:15%
(laughter)

5102
03:54:38.241 --> 03:54:39.188 line:15%
(whooping)

5103
03:54:39.188 --> 03:54:41.160 line:15%
Remove five or ten, how much?

5104
03:54:41.160 --> 03:54:44.160 line:15%
50 gold from your thing.
Interesting, interesting.

5105
03:54:45.100 --> 03:54:47.800 line:15%
So, we'll see here this goes next week.

5106
03:54:47.800 --> 03:54:48.633 line:15%
Gosh.

5107
03:54:49.616 --> 03:54:50.449 line:15%
(groaning)

5108
03:54:50.449 --> 03:54:52.389 line:15%
Take you down to Goblin Town.

5109
03:54:52.389 --> 03:54:55.124 line:15%
(chuckling)

5110
03:54:55.124 --> 03:54:57.820 line:15%
Oh, I was so curious to meet the halfling.

5111
03:54:57.820 --> 03:54:59.392 line:15%
Hoo.
I know.

5112
03:54:59.392 --> 03:55:00.225 line:15%
You may still yet.

5113
03:55:00.225 --> 03:55:03.720 line:15%
We'd best kill her, we'll just kill her next episode.

5114
03:55:03.720 --> 03:55:04.691 line:15%
She at all.
That's right.

5115
03:55:04.691 --> 03:55:07.640 line:15%
You don't know.
You don't know.

5116
03:55:07.640 --> 03:55:09.900 line:15%
I lied about my story a hundred times before.

5117
03:55:10.865 --> 03:55:13.159 line:15%
If you'd been faking, he has a,

5118
03:55:13.159 --> 03:55:15.502 line:15%
a dude's collective checks.
That's right.

5119
03:55:15.502 --> 03:55:16.335 line:15%
(laughter)

5120
03:55:16.335 --> 03:55:20.240 line:15%
Completes the ritual and Nott emerges as a, like, goliath.

5121
03:55:21.084 --> 03:55:21.917 line:15%
(laughter)

5122
03:55:21.917 --> 03:55:23.721 line:15%
(talking over each other)

5123
03:55:23.721 --> 03:55:25.843 line:15%
(laughter)

5124
03:55:25.843 --> 03:55:28.183 line:15%
Yeza was an actor.

5125
03:55:28.183 --> 03:55:30.021 line:15%
And Luc was, like, a really small actor.

5126
03:55:30.021 --> 03:55:31.372 line:15%
(laughter)

5127
03:55:31.372 --> 03:55:33.065 line:15%
"Hey, when do I get my 50 bucks?"

5128
03:55:33.065 --> 03:55:34.142 line:15%
(talking over each other)

5129
03:55:34.142 --> 03:55:35.850 line:15%
Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay.

5130
03:55:38.057 --> 03:55:38.890 line:15%
Anyway.

5131
03:55:38.890 --> 03:55:39.723
It'll be like Andy.
Yeah, new.

5132
03:55:39.723 --> 03:55:41.080
We'll pick that up next week.

5133
03:55:42.878 --> 03:55:44.160
Thank you guys for joining us.

5134
03:55:44.160 --> 03:55:46.300

5135
03:55:46.300 --> 03:55:48.310

5136
03:55:48.310 --> 03:55:49.893
Good night.

5137
03:55:49.893 --> 03:55:51.144
(groaning)

5138
03:55:51.144 --> 03:55:53.894
