00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:01.860
MATT: Hello, everybody, and welcome to tonight's episode

2
00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:03.080
of Critical Role, where a bunch of us

3
00:00:03.080 --> 00:00:04.140
nerdy-ass voice actors sit around

4
00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:05.255
and play Dungeons &amp; Dragons.

5
00:00:05.255 --> 00:00:08.172
ALL: We play Dungeons &amp; Dragons!

6
00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:13.530
MATT: So yes, before we jump into tonight's session,

7
00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:14.830
we have some announcements to get through,

8
00:00:14.830 --> 00:00:16.030
so hang tight for just a second,

9
00:00:16.030 --> 00:00:17.460
while we go into our first

10
00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:19.030
of two sponsorships for the night.

11
00:00:19.030 --> 00:00:21.240
Our first, our friends at Hero Forge.

12
00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:22.073
Sam.

13
00:00:22.073 --> 00:00:23.360
MARISHA: ♪ Hero Forge ♪
SAM: Hero Forge?

14
00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:24.510
Tonight's episode brought to you

15
00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:25.550
by our friends at Hero Forge,

16
00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:28.250
makers of on-demand miniatures of all types.

17
00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:30.410
I've used it, and it is sweet.

18
00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:32.480
But now, it's now even sweeter,

19
00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:34.870
because of their newly updated online platform,

20
00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:38.510
Hero Forge 2.0, where you can still customize and print

21
00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:40.250
your 3D minis, but for the first time,

22
00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:42.780
you can also do it in color.

23
00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:45.655
Yes, you can now design and color your personal minis

24
00:00:45.655 --> 00:00:47.220
with a variety of colors and techniques,

25
00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:50.040
including dry brushing, washing and more.

26
00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:51.430
They just launched the update this week.

27
00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:54.980
So be one of the first to get a 3D custom colored mini,

28
00:00:54.980 --> 00:00:58.070
at heroforge.com/Kickstarter.

29
00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:01.860
Now, as I said, this new update makes their platform

30
00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:04.520
even sweeter, and it got me thinking,

31
00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:07.350
everything is better when it's sweeter, right?

32
00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:10.050
Well, thanks to Hero Forge, come bring it out, boys,

33
00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:12.300
I'm going to put that theory to the test.

34
00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:16.470
I've taken common food items, and with,

35
00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:17.460
that we all know and love--

36
00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:19.263
TALIESIN: No.
MARISHA: This is going to be gross.

37
00:01:19.263 --> 00:01:22.813
SAM: And I'm going to test if making them sweeter

38
00:01:22.813 --> 00:01:25.129
makes them better.

39
00:01:25.129 --> 00:01:26.550
So we'll start

40
00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:28.310
with the common chili dog.

41
00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:29.976
TRAVIS: What?
TALIESIN: Nope.

42
00:01:29.976 --> 00:01:31.683
SAM: Adding a little

43
00:01:31.683 --> 00:01:34.570
whipped cream to it.
ASHLEY: What's already on it?

44
00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:35.960
SAM: Yep, and let's see.

45
00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:37.693
LAURA: Nope.
SAM: If it makes it better.

46
00:01:37.693 --> 00:01:38.904
TALIESIN: May I use this as a shield?

47
00:01:38.904 --> 00:01:43.290
LAURA: No, wait, hold that down.

48
00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:44.308 line:15%
SAM: It's better.

49
00:01:44.308 --> 00:01:45.900 line:15%
TRAVIS: No way.
SAM: That is better.

50
00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:48.740 line:15%
TRAVIS: You're such a foodie, how are you even doing this?

51
00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:51.060
LAURA: Yeah, get that-- do not put that near me.

52
00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:52.657
MARISHA: Don't, just ugh.

53
00:01:52.657 --> 00:01:55.913
SAM: Let's try a salad.
TRAVIS: No!

54
00:01:55.913 --> 00:01:57.080
SAM: This is your standard Caesar.

55
00:01:57.080 --> 00:02:00.140
LAURA: That looks better than the chili dog.

56
00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:03.214
SAM: Let's see what a salad tastes like with whipped cream.

57
00:02:03.214 --> 00:02:05.630
TALIESIN: Help!
ASHLEY: That might not be as bad.

58
00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:07.630
LAURA: That one's not bad.
ASHLEY: That one's not--

59
00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:09.620
TALIESIN: If there's vinegar in there, it's going to curdle.

60
00:02:09.620 --> 00:02:11.161
It's going to curdle.
SAM: It's better.

61
00:02:11.161 --> 00:02:13.732 line:15%
(laughter)

62
00:02:13.732 --> 00:02:15.790 line:15%
Oh! There's a sound effect.

63
00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:19.282
LIAM: We'll miss you, Hero Forge, we'll miss you.

64
00:02:19.282 --> 00:02:20.980
SAM: Flamin' Hot Cheetos.

65
00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:23.240
ASHLEY: Whoa, hey, ho, hey, hold on, hold on.

66
00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:24.805
Give me some before you ruin them.

67
00:02:24.805 --> 00:02:25.750
SAM: Sure.

68
00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:26.950
ASHLEY: Because I love Flamin' Hot Cheetos.

69
00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:28.640
SAM: Are they better sweeter?

70
00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:30.506
Let's find out.

71
00:02:30.506 --> 00:02:33.040
TALIESIN: Okay, I'm all right with this,
I'm all right with this.

72
00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:33.873
MARISHA: It's like a--

73
00:02:33.873 --> 00:02:35.550
ASHLEY: I feel like it's going to be good.

74
00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:37.807
LAURA: Why you do you have to
make such a mess about it, Sam?

75
00:02:37.807 --> 00:02:40.460
MARISHA: It's spicy.
TRAVIS: -- shit through the back of your chair.

76
00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:41.293
LAURA: How is it?
TRAVIS: It's going to be

77
00:02:41.293 --> 00:02:43.070 line:15%
a river of magma.
SAM: It's better.

78
00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:45.985 line:15%
TRAVIS: No!
DANI (V.O.): Better.

79
00:02:45.985 --> 00:02:47.877
ASHLEY: How is it?
LAURA: It's not bad.

80
00:02:47.877 --> 00:02:50.750
SAM: There's two more.
LAURA: It's really not bad.

81
00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:52.393
SAM: There's two more, two more.
LAURA: No.

82
00:02:52.393 --> 00:02:54.037
SAM: Pepperoni pizza.
LAURA: Nope.

83
00:02:54.037 --> 00:02:56.373
MATT: Aw, that one's been sitting out for a while.

84
00:02:56.373 --> 00:02:57.910
LIAM: You going to fold that shit, fold that.

85
00:02:57.910 --> 00:03:00.640
LAURA: No, no, be careful with the table.

86
00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:02.194
SAM: Mm.
TRAVIS: (groaning)

87
00:03:02.194 --> 00:03:03.750
ASHLEY: It's all over your--
TRAVIS: Oh god.

88
00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:06.087
TALIESIN: Oh, yep, no, it's on the, no.

89
00:03:06.087 --> 00:03:07.620
SAM: Not as good.
TRAVIS: Okay.

90
00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:08.828
DANI (V.O.): Worse.

91
00:03:08.828 --> 00:03:10.784 line:15%
(laughter)

92
00:03:10.784 --> 00:03:12.515
SAM: But last but not least--
TRAVIS: You're not.

93
00:03:12.515 --> 00:03:14.109
MATT: Oh no.

94
00:03:14.109 --> 00:03:15.100
SAM: Fine wine.

95
00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:16.471
LAURA: No!

96
00:03:16.471 --> 00:03:20.182
(yelling)

97
00:03:20.182 --> 00:03:22.570
MARISHA: It instantly curdled.

98
00:03:22.570 --> 00:03:24.420
TRAVIS: Don't, no, don't, no!

99
00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:25.470
ASHLEY: It's dessert.

100
00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:26.690
TALIESIN: Go for it, go for it!

101
00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:27.523
MARISHA: Ooh, did you see that?

102
00:03:27.523 --> 00:03:28.960
TRAVIS: Yeah, I did, I did, I did.

103
00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:29.793 line:15%
SAM: Worse.

104
00:03:29.793 --> 00:03:31.610 line:15%
(laughter)
DANI (V.O.): Worse.

105
00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:32.754 line:15%
SAM: Wait, let me try it again.

106
00:03:32.754 --> 00:03:35.632 line:15%
(yelling)

107
00:03:35.632 --> 00:03:36.757 line:15%
SAM: Worse.

108
00:03:36.757 --> 00:03:37.590 line:15%
DANI (V.O.): Worse.

109
00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:38.600 line:15%
SAM: Oh, that was good.

110
00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:40.990
Maybe I should brush my teeth a little.

111
00:03:40.990 --> 00:03:43.170
MATT: (shouting) No, no, no!

112
00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:45.322
SAM: You know, just clean off the old teeth.

113
00:03:45.322 --> 00:03:47.490
TALIESIN: No, no, no.

114
00:03:49.332 --> 00:03:51.174
MATT: I'm pretty sure all this is against TOS.

115
00:03:52.216 --> 00:03:53.922 line:15%
SAM: Worse.

116
00:03:53.922 --> 00:03:55.565 line:15%
DANI (V.O.): Worse.
SAM: Oh, wait.

117
00:03:55.565 --> 00:03:56.706 line:15%
Better.

118
00:03:56.706 --> 00:03:58.167 line:15%
DANI (V.O.): Better.

119
00:03:58.167 --> 00:04:00.800 line:15%
SAM: Well, I think I've proven a point, guys.

120
00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:02.350
Making things sweeter makes it better.

121
00:04:02.350 --> 00:04:04.110
So go check out the sweet new update

122
00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:07.713

124
00:04:09.775 --> 00:04:11.257
TRAVIS: Don't!
(yelling)

125
00:04:11.257 --> 00:04:14.829
No, stop it!
(laughter)

126
00:04:14.829 --> 00:04:18.131
TALIESIN: No.

127
00:04:18.131 --> 00:04:20.453
TRAVIS: You looked like you walked under a street lamp.

128
00:04:20.453 --> 00:04:21.903
SAM: Back to you, Matt.

129
00:04:24.956 --> 00:04:28.241
LAURA: Oh no.
TRAVIS: No, no, no, why?

130
00:04:28.241 --> 00:04:32.575
(laughter)

131
00:04:33.692 --> 00:04:37.212
TRAVIS: Do you have antacids on standby?

132
00:04:37.212 --> 00:04:38.220
SAM: I'll just brush my teeth again.

133
00:04:38.220 --> 00:04:41.080
LAURA: I'm so glad that I moved further away.

134
00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:42.060
MATT: Thank you, Sam.

135
00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:44.220

00:04:53.578 --> 00:04:54.642
MARISHA: Do it.

140
00:04:54.642 --> 00:04:56.757
LAURA: No, it's good, it's good.

141
00:04:56.757 --> 00:04:58.298 line:15%
ASHLEY: (crunching)

142
00:04:58.298 --> 00:05:00.031
Oh, that is actually really good.

143
00:05:00.031 --> 00:05:01.260 line:15%
MARISHA: Yeah, that makes the most sense.

144
00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:02.862
ASHLEY: That makes the most sense to me.

145
00:05:02.862 --> 00:05:04.908
The wine one did, but--
TRAVIS: Get at us Frito Lay, we'll--

146
00:05:04.908 --> 00:05:06.633
MATT: All right, moving on.
ASHLEY: Okay, okay, okay.

147
00:05:06.633 --> 00:05:07.470
MATT: To our--

148
00:05:07.470 --> 00:05:11.860

for our free Comic Book Day special comic

171
00:06:01.690 --> 00:06:03.070
that's coming out.

172
00:06:03.070 --> 00:06:05.460
The cover art was created
by amazing Critter Hunter Bonyun

173
00:06:05.460 --> 00:06:07.350
and colors by Stephan McGowan.

174
00:06:07.350 --> 00:06:10.321
You can pick up your own
issue for Free Comic Book Day

175
00:06:10.321 --> 00:06:14.930
at your local comic book
shop on Free Comic Book Day.

176
00:06:14.930 --> 00:06:17.380
It's May 2nd, so keep
an eye on your calendars

177
00:06:17.380 --> 00:06:18.700
now for it, it's exciting,

178
00:06:18.700 --> 00:06:21.620
because it's a fun,
little stand alone piece.

179
00:06:21.620 --> 00:06:23.670
Even if you haven't read
any of Vox Machina Origins,

180
00:06:23.670 --> 00:06:25.440
it sits a little bit outside

181
00:06:25.440 --> 00:06:26.550
of the realm of the first campaign,

182
00:06:26.550 --> 00:06:28.010
and it's got some cool perspective.

183
00:06:28.010 --> 00:06:30.590
And we get to share a
cover with the name Neil Gaiman,

184
00:06:30.590 --> 00:06:32.200
who has content in there, as well,

185
00:06:32.200 --> 00:06:33.207
and that's kind of cool.

186
00:06:33.207 --> 00:06:34.907
TRAVIS: Sure.
MATT: Hi, Neil.

187
00:06:34.907 --> 00:06:37.280
ASHLEY: "Has content in there as well."
TALIESIN: Yeah, I know.

188
00:06:37.280 --> 00:06:38.610
MATT: Well, it's weird, because it's like us,

189
00:06:38.610 --> 00:06:39.820
and it's like, also Neil Gaiman.

190
00:06:39.820 --> 00:06:42.460
I'm like, this should be
the other way around, but okay.

191
00:06:42.460 --> 00:06:43.822
But yeah, check it out.

192
00:06:44.986 --> 00:06:45.840
I think that's it for me, and Marisha,

193
00:06:45.840 --> 00:06:47.020
you have an announcement.

194
00:06:47.020 --> 00:06:48.460
TRAVIS: I do.

195
00:06:48.460 --> 00:06:52.280
Speaking of Sam's ridiculous antics,

196
00:06:52.280 --> 00:06:54.371
and also Liam,

197
00:06:54.371 --> 00:06:57.746
All Work, No Play is coming back!

198
00:06:57.746 --> 00:06:58.928
SAM: What?!

199
00:06:58.928 --> 00:07:00.220
LIAM: No, surely not, no!

200
00:07:00.220 --> 00:07:01.622
MARISHA: I know.

201
00:07:01.622 --> 00:07:04.030
Just-- you know, we had to
keep up with the tradition

202
00:07:04.030 --> 00:07:08.890
of the podcast and make
it take forever for Season 2.

203
00:07:08.890 --> 00:07:10.745
LIAM: We recorded a minute a week.

204
00:07:10.745 --> 00:07:12.830
TRAVIS: Did you drink the entire time?

205
00:07:12.830 --> 00:07:16.400
MARISHA: Oh, yes, everyone continues
to have its signature cocktail

206
00:07:16.400 --> 00:07:18.480
attached to it, but it is premiering

207
00:07:18.480 --> 00:07:21.230
not this next Tuesday,
but the Tuesday after,

208
00:07:21.230 --> 00:07:23.949
February 4th.
TRAVIS: Woo!

209
00:07:23.949 --> 00:07:27.130
MARISHA: At 4:00 p.m. on our Twitch channel

210
00:07:27.130 --> 00:07:28.520
for our Season 2 premiere.

211
00:07:28.520 --> 00:07:30.320
We are airing the show
a little bit differently.

212
00:07:30.320 --> 00:07:32.440
Instead of a Friday night
show, we're going to put it

213
00:07:32.440 --> 00:07:34.690
in the Yee-Haw Game Ranch time slot.

214
00:07:34.690 --> 00:07:35.656
TRAVIS: Mm-hmm.

215
00:07:35.656 --> 00:07:40.550
MARISHA: And it's going to air
biweekly for the entire season.

216
00:07:40.550 --> 00:07:42.480
SAM: We're very excited about it.

217
00:07:42.480 --> 00:07:45.140
Yep, we did some fun stuff.
MARISHA: It's hilarious.

218
00:07:45.140 --> 00:07:50.140
There are some references
to times of the year.

219
00:07:50.150 --> 00:07:52.194
SAM: When we shot it?
MARISHA: When we shot it.

220
00:07:52.194 --> 00:07:53.027
(laughter)

221
00:07:53.027 --> 00:07:55.970
LIAM: You will be shocked
at how long ago we started.

222
00:07:55.970 --> 00:07:59.344
MARISHA: Yes.
(laughter)

223
00:07:59.344 --> 00:08:01.170
It took a bit, but yes.

224
00:08:01.170 --> 00:08:03.120
It's worth the wait.

225
00:08:03.120 --> 00:08:05.242
TRAVIS: Old President Obama.
MARISHA: Yeah.

226
00:08:05.242 --> 00:08:07.990
(laughter)

227
00:08:07.990 --> 00:08:10.220
MATT: The Force Awakens is coming up.

228
00:08:11.080 --> 00:08:12.750
MARISHA: That's more accurate.

229
00:08:12.750 --> 00:08:14.306
Yeah, there's like shit like that in it.

230
00:08:14.306 --> 00:08:16.590
Like, oh, wait, what?

231
00:08:16.590 --> 00:08:18.030
Okay.

232
00:08:18.030 --> 00:08:19.375
Yeah, it's great.

233
00:08:20.300 --> 00:08:22.590
It's worth the wait, tune in.

234
00:08:22.590 --> 00:08:24.020
MATT: There we go.
MARISHA: Content.

235
00:08:24.020 --> 00:08:25.570
TRAVIS: Finger guns.
MARISHA: Pew, pew.

236
00:08:25.570 --> 00:08:27.783
TRAVIS and MARISHA: Pew, pew, pew.

237
00:08:27.783 --> 00:08:29.250
MATT: Thank you, Marisha.
MARISHA: Yeah.

238
00:08:29.250 --> 00:08:31.047
MATT: Laura, you have some
announcements as well.

239
00:08:31.047 --> 00:08:32.570
LAURA: Oh me?
SAM: Oh, she does.

240
00:08:32.570 --> 00:08:33.700
MATT: You.
LAURA: Oh, well,

241
00:08:33.700 --> 00:08:36.450
you guys may have noticed, I'm wearing this

242
00:08:37.340 --> 00:08:41.805
fantabulous Traveler Con--
(yelling)

243
00:08:41.805 --> 00:08:42.849
What what!

244
00:08:42.849 --> 00:08:44.140
MARISHA: It's so cute.

245
00:08:44.140 --> 00:08:47.680
LAURA: That's available in our stores right now.

246
00:08:47.680 --> 00:08:50.078
MARISHA: You too can join the cult.

247
00:08:50.078 --> 00:08:52.380
LAURA: Were they handmade by Jester?

248
00:08:52.380 --> 00:08:53.213
Possibly.

249
00:08:53.213 --> 00:08:56.110
TRAVIS: What's on the--
what's on the cuff there?

250
00:08:56.110 --> 00:08:57.598
SAM: Oh, is that a secret?

251
00:08:57.598 --> 00:08:59.174
LAURA: Why you gotta
call it out like that?

252
00:08:59.174 --> 00:09:01.087
SAM: Let me see it.
TRAVIS: I just saw it. I don't know.

253
00:09:01.087 --> 00:09:01.920
SAM: Don't show them.

254
00:09:01.920 --> 00:09:03.590
LAURA: I don't know what you're talking about.

255
00:09:03.590 --> 00:09:05.420
ASHLEY: Oh, that's cool.
LAURA: It's cute, right?

256
00:09:05.420 --> 00:09:07.250
ASHLEY: Yeah.
SAM: Ooh, there's an Easter egg.

257
00:09:07.250 --> 00:09:08.720
LAURA: So anyway.
ASHLEY: You're supposed

258
00:09:08.720 --> 00:09:09.830
to wear it this way, right?

259
00:09:09.830 --> 00:09:11.355
LAURA: Yeah.
(laughter)

260
00:09:11.355 --> 00:09:13.360
TRAVIS: Are all the cultists ordering?
LAURA: So yeah, check them out,

261
00:09:13.360 --> 00:09:15.660
they're in both our U.S. and UK shops.

262
00:09:15.660 --> 00:09:18.271
And then, other thing that I wanted to mention

263
00:09:18.271 --> 00:09:23.271
is on Saturday, I will be joining
the Pull Your Finger Out,

264
00:09:23.500 --> 00:09:25.290
what finger, where it was, I don't know,

265
00:09:25.290 --> 00:09:26.710
but I'll be joining the
Pull Your Finger Out

266
00:09:26.710 --> 00:09:27.893
charity stream--

267
00:09:27.893 --> 00:09:30.840
MATT: That's a long name
for a charity stream.

268
00:09:30.840 --> 00:09:33.398
TALIESIN: Is it better if it's sweeter
is really my question.

269
00:09:33.398 --> 00:09:35.998
(laughter)
LAURA: Oh, no.

270
00:09:37.181 --> 00:09:39.230
LAURA: It's a charity stream put
together by my very good friend,

271
00:09:39.230 --> 00:09:42.310
Liam McIntyre to benefit those affected

272
00:09:42.310 --> 00:09:44.623
by the Australian bush fires.

273
00:09:44.623 --> 00:09:47.420
So that's going on from 11:00 to 5:00 on Saturday.

274
00:09:47.420 --> 00:09:50.150
Our good friends at
Retro Replay are hosting it,

275
00:09:50.150 --> 00:09:53.640
so check it out on
youtube.com/c/RetroReplay.

276
00:09:53.640 --> 00:09:55.400
I'll be joining around 3:00 p.m.,

277
00:09:55.400 --> 00:09:57.110
if you want to come show the critter love,

278
00:09:57.110 --> 00:09:59.639
I would appreciate it.
ASHLEY: Give it a critter a hug!

279
00:09:59.639 --> 00:10:01.540
LAURA: That's right.
LIAM: Critter hug!

280
00:10:01.540 --> 00:10:03.330
MATT: Thank you, Laura.

281
00:10:03.330 --> 00:10:05.560
All right, then, I believe that concludes

282
00:10:05.560 --> 00:10:07.938
our announcements for the evening.

283
00:10:07.938 --> 00:10:12.212
So let's go ahead and jump
into tonight's episode of...

284
00:10:12.212 --> 00:10:13.637

MATT: And welcome back.

322
00:11:53.338 --> 00:11:56.378
Oh, happy to have you join us, Sam.

323
00:11:56.378 --> 00:11:57.547
SAM: Just brushed my teeth again.

324
00:11:57.547 --> 00:12:00.503
MATT: (laughs) Is that how you keep them so large?

325
00:12:00.503 --> 00:12:03.331
(laughter)

326
00:12:03.331 --> 00:12:05.602
SAM: Wow.
TRAVIS: DM burn!

327
00:12:05.602 --> 00:12:07.606
Oh shit, we're in trouble.

328
00:12:07.606 --> 00:12:09.475
SAM: Burn.
TALIESIN: Mercer family hot sauce.

329
00:12:09.475 --> 00:12:11.427
TRAVIS: Two beholders and a fucking tarrasque--

330
00:12:11.427 --> 00:12:14.849
LIAM: Way to go tea on that man.
That is evil twin Matthew Mercer.

331
00:12:14.849 --> 00:12:16.044
(laughter)

332
00:12:16.044 --> 00:12:17.419
MATT: I get one every century.

333
00:12:17.419 --> 00:12:19.535
TALIESIN: That's the most tea I've ever seen you throw.

334
00:12:21.333 --> 00:12:23.258
TALIESIN: Holy shit.
ASHLEY: We should be nervous.

335
00:12:23.258 --> 00:12:25.723
TRAVIS: He's stunned, ladies and
gentlemen, he's on the ropes.

336
00:12:25.723 --> 00:12:29.587
MARISHA: I'm so proud!
ASHLEY: I know, it's like, "I might kill you all."

337
00:12:29.587 --> 00:12:30.778
MATT: So.

338
00:12:30.778 --> 00:12:33.861
(laughter)

339
00:12:33.861 --> 00:12:38.861
Last we left off, the Mighty Nein had brokered

340
00:12:38.964 --> 00:12:41.777
a coming negotiation between the warring nations

341
00:12:41.777 --> 00:12:44.826
of the Dwendalian Empire in the Kryn Dynasty.

342
00:12:44.826 --> 00:12:47.009
Set to occur somewhere in the Lucidian Ocean

343
00:12:47.009 --> 00:12:50.174
between Nicodranas and the Whitedawn Lagoon,

344
00:12:50.174 --> 00:12:53.932
about four, roughly four weeks out,

345
00:12:53.932 --> 00:12:56.120
I think is when they had confirmed it.

346
00:12:56.120 --> 00:12:59.029
You also heard that they had acquired and arrested Vence,

347
00:12:59.029 --> 00:13:03.873
the fugitive who was part of the Angel of Irons cult.

348
00:13:03.873 --> 00:13:06.788
And in the interim, you made your way back to Xhorhas.

349
00:13:06.788 --> 00:13:11.788
You made it to your home, the Xhorhaus,

350
00:13:13.087 --> 00:13:15.599
and had an evening to rest after an extended period

351
00:13:15.599 --> 00:13:18.970
of extreme duress and stress,

352
00:13:18.970 --> 00:13:21.865
the recovery of your friend Yasha,

353
00:13:21.865 --> 00:13:25.685
some underground pit fighting,

354
00:13:25.685 --> 00:13:28.285
and a dinner with Essek after an invitation--
MARISHA: Hot boi!

355
00:13:28.285 --> 00:13:29.781
ASHLEY: Hot boi!
TRAVIS: Wow.

356
00:13:29.781 --> 00:13:31.960
MATT: In which you got a chance

357
00:13:31.960 --> 00:13:33.410
to know each other a little better.

358
00:13:35.200 --> 00:13:39.530
You then, in discussing your plans moving forward,

359
00:13:39.530 --> 00:13:42.940
some possibilities and pursuing some of the various goals

360
00:13:42.940 --> 00:13:45.660
that still remain looming for a few of you,

361
00:13:45.660 --> 00:13:49.730
you were greeted by Essek and he offered

362
00:13:49.730 --> 00:13:52.100
at one point to help you with this strange problem

363
00:13:52.100 --> 00:13:53.720
you were having with this equation for the spell

364
00:13:53.720 --> 00:13:56.380
that you had been developing since discovering

365
00:13:56.380 --> 00:13:59.670
its early sketches, essentially,

366
00:13:59.670 --> 00:14:02.240
or the first half of its development by Halas

367
00:14:02.240 --> 00:14:05.360
within his Happy Fun Ball, as you put it.

368
00:14:07.170 --> 00:14:11.780
With the aid of Essek, both Nott and Caleb,

369
00:14:11.780 --> 00:14:15.560
up in his tower, finished the development of this spell.

370
00:14:16.540 --> 00:14:18.670
You all rushed to gather your materials

371
00:14:18.670 --> 00:14:22.310
that were required for its casting and watched

372
00:14:22.310 --> 00:14:23.800
as Caleb prepared the ritual

373
00:14:24.990 --> 00:14:28.740
to bring Nott back to her original form,

374
00:14:29.720 --> 00:14:31.270
the body she is meant to have.

375
00:14:32.540 --> 00:14:34.910
The ritual progressed, seemingly without issue

376
00:14:34.910 --> 00:14:38.340
until the moment in which the transition

377
00:14:38.340 --> 00:14:39.970
of the body was meant to happen.

378
00:14:41.150 --> 00:14:42.580
Reaching towards it, however,

379
00:14:42.580 --> 00:14:46.240
the magic was balked by some sort of dark power,

380
00:14:46.240 --> 00:14:49.120
a curse that remained laid upon Nott,

381
00:14:49.120 --> 00:14:51.060
preventing it from succeeding,

382
00:14:51.060 --> 00:14:55.110
locking herself still to the current goblin body

383
00:14:56.450 --> 00:14:57.800
that she's grown to loathe.

384
00:14:59.760 --> 00:15:01.450
Well, maybe grown a little more comfortable

385
00:15:01.450 --> 00:15:03.220
with it since then, but.

386
00:15:03.220 --> 00:15:05.497
SAM: She sure doesn't like her teeth anymore.

387
00:15:05.497 --> 00:15:08.414
(laughter)

388
00:15:11.880 --> 00:15:15.371
MATT: As the ritual comes to a...

389
00:15:16.688 --> 00:15:18.488
unexpected end,

390
00:15:19.700 --> 00:15:21.870
you look as the clay element of the tub

391
00:15:21.870 --> 00:15:24.640
that Nott had been placed upon

392
00:15:24.640 --> 00:15:27.060
has shattered and scattered across the room,

393
00:15:27.060 --> 00:15:30.020
the magic itself suddenly flaring out,

394
00:15:30.020 --> 00:15:33.490
the sigil that marked the ritual going cold,

395
00:15:33.490 --> 00:15:36.380
and all of you look down to see Nott there,

396
00:15:36.380 --> 00:15:40.100
sitting atop the broken sections of hardened clay,

397
00:15:41.220 --> 00:15:45.220
a goblin as she's always been since you met her.

398
00:15:47.120 --> 00:15:48.880
LIAM: Caleb just starts checking his notes

399
00:15:48.880 --> 00:15:50.070
and everything that they worked on together

400
00:15:50.070 --> 00:15:52.030
to see what went wrong.

401
00:15:53.713 --> 00:15:57.120
SAM: It didn't-- it didn't work, did it?

402
00:15:59.120 --> 00:16:03.270
LAURA: I mean, I think you're a little less green

403
00:16:03.270 --> 00:16:05.130
than you were before.

404
00:16:05.130 --> 00:16:07.780
SAM: Just look at my hands and stuff. Looks the same?

405
00:16:07.780 --> 00:16:08.613
MATT: Unchanged.

406
00:16:09.920 --> 00:16:11.624
SAM: Yeah, yeah, yes,

407
00:16:11.624 --> 00:16:13.800
look all around, see if it's all the same.

408
00:16:13.800 --> 00:16:15.200
LAURA: I'll check the ears

409
00:16:15.200 --> 00:16:17.997
and I'll check the back of the head to see.

410
00:16:17.997 --> 00:16:22.340
MATT: Some flecks of dry, brown clay that had gotten wedged

411
00:16:22.340 --> 00:16:24.020
in the elements of the hair, but beyond that,

412
00:16:24.020 --> 00:16:25.070
no noticeable change.

413
00:16:26.137 --> 00:16:27.937
SAM: (sighs)
LAURA: You're still Nott.

414
00:16:29.314 --> 00:16:30.617
SAM: Huh.

415
00:16:31.500 --> 00:16:35.190
I-- well, I mean, did you do it right?

416
00:16:35.190 --> 00:16:36.840
Did he do it right?

417
00:16:36.840 --> 00:16:38.320
MATT: Essek goes,

418
00:16:38.320 --> 00:16:41.190
"From what I could observe of this ritual,

419
00:16:41.190 --> 00:16:45.640
"everything was done to the required specifications."

420
00:16:45.640 --> 00:16:47.515
LIAM: I'm meticulous.

421
00:16:47.515 --> 00:16:48.931
SAM: Yes, you are.

422
00:16:50.140 --> 00:16:52.305
Did you all hear that? The--

423
00:16:52.305 --> 00:16:53.200
LAURA: Hear what?

424
00:16:53.200 --> 00:16:55.350
SAM: The woman laughing?

425
00:16:56.260 --> 00:16:57.200
MARISHA: Did we?
LAURA: No, we didn't--

426
00:16:57.200 --> 00:16:59.660
MATT: Only the both of you heard it.

427
00:16:59.660 --> 00:17:02.280
LAURA: I don't know what you're talking about.

428
00:17:02.280 --> 00:17:04.060
TALIESIN: No.
ASHLEY: None of us were laughing.

429
00:17:05.380 --> 00:17:06.646
SAM: I hope not.

430
00:17:06.646 --> 00:17:08.146
LIAM: I heard it.

431
00:17:09.540 --> 00:17:10.790
LAURA: What did it sound like?

432
00:17:12.100 --> 00:17:16.400
SAM: It sounded distant, and evil,

433
00:17:17.640 --> 00:17:21.610
and it sounded like-- yeah, I mean, the only person

434
00:17:21.610 --> 00:17:24.900
I can think of is the person who did this to me,

435
00:17:24.900 --> 00:17:28.130
this woman, this mage woman.

436
00:17:28.130 --> 00:17:29.990
It sounded like her, maybe.

437
00:17:31.270 --> 00:17:32.310
Maybe?

438
00:17:32.310 --> 00:17:34.510
LAURA: Did it sound like when I send you a message?

439
00:17:35.415 --> 00:17:36.890
SAM: I don't know that

440
00:17:36.890 --> 00:17:38.510
you've ever sent me a message.

441
00:17:38.510 --> 00:17:40.640
LAURA: I'm going to send Nott a message right now.

442
00:17:40.640 --> 00:17:42.090
MATT: Okay, what are you going to send?

443
00:17:42.090 --> 00:17:43.114
LAURA: I'm going to say--

444
00:17:43.114 --> 00:17:44.580
this is weird being right next to.

445
00:17:44.580 --> 00:17:46.020
Is it going to be like feedback on a cellphone?

446
00:17:46.020 --> 00:17:48.000
SAM: I can hear a delay.

447
00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:49.210
LAURA: What does it sound like?

448
00:17:49.210 --> 00:17:51.482
SAM: Oh, I have to leave the room.

449
00:17:51.482 --> 00:17:52.920
MATT: (laughs)
TALIESIN: Go downstairs.

450
00:17:52.920 --> 00:17:54.400
SAM: I'll leave the room.

451
00:17:54.400 --> 00:17:57.317
Okay, go.
LAURA: Does it sound like this?

452
00:17:57.317 --> 00:17:59.652
Did it sound like the laughing?
TRAVIS: That's it.

453
00:18:02.020 --> 00:18:03.270
SAM: Did it sound like that?

454
00:18:05.170 --> 00:18:06.930
MATT: A different kind of sense.

455
00:18:06.930 --> 00:18:09.920
This is a series of words

456
00:18:09.920 --> 00:18:11.100
being placed into your mind,

457
00:18:11.100 --> 00:18:13.550
into your very aware consciousness.

458
00:18:13.550 --> 00:18:17.510
The laughter felt deep-seated within you.

459
00:18:17.510 --> 00:18:19.900
SAM: Not the same.
MATT: No.

460
00:18:19.900 --> 00:18:23.877
MARISHA: Well, I mean, it's gotta to be exactly that.

461
00:18:23.877 --> 00:18:25.118
SAM: What does that mean?

462
00:18:25.118 --> 00:18:27.610
She's watching me, she's haunting me?

463
00:18:27.610 --> 00:18:30.516
LIAM: She still has some sort of grasp on you, yeah?

464
00:18:30.516 --> 00:18:31.349
LAURA: Oh my gosh.

465
00:18:31.349 --> 00:18:35.500
Do you think she can hear everything you do?

466
00:18:35.500 --> 00:18:37.110
SAM: Has she been with us this whole time?

467
00:18:37.110 --> 00:18:38.410
Who is she?

468
00:18:40.194 --> 00:18:43.240
LAURA: Do you remember anything about her, Nott?

469
00:18:43.240 --> 00:18:44.580
LIAM: Go over it again in your mind.

470
00:18:44.580 --> 00:18:45.780
Tell us the story again.

471
00:18:47.010 --> 00:18:49.290
SAM: Oh, well.

472
00:18:53.520 --> 00:18:55.880
I'll skip some of it.

473
00:18:58.018 --> 00:19:02.736
The pertinent parts are they took me to a river,

474
00:19:02.736 --> 00:19:06.610
they drowned me, and that's all I remembered

475
00:19:06.610 --> 00:19:08.910
for a long time, except, then, when I woke up,

476
00:19:09.760 --> 00:19:13.510
it was to the sound of that laughter.

477
00:19:13.510 --> 00:19:17.100
It was to the sound of that woman,

478
00:19:20.660 --> 00:19:24.702
just enjoying whatever she had done to me.

479
00:19:26.300 --> 00:19:28.830
I was in a sort of a state of shock,

480
00:19:32.622 --> 00:19:34.350
I didn't feel like myself.

481
00:19:34.350 --> 00:19:36.320
I wasn't sure what was going on.

482
00:19:36.320 --> 00:19:38.940
Things sounded louder, and felt different,

483
00:19:40.215 --> 00:19:44.730
and my body was colder, and I wasn't paying much attention

484
00:19:44.730 --> 00:19:47.859
but she was there. She was robed,

485
00:19:47.859 --> 00:19:52.550
and she was older, and--

486
00:19:52.550 --> 00:19:54.410
TRAVIS: You were at the river still?

487
00:19:54.410 --> 00:19:58.775
SAM: No, they had taken me somewhere, to her home?

488
00:19:59.920 --> 00:20:01.050
Did she seem--
Lair?

489
00:20:01.050 --> 00:20:02.360
Did she seem short?

490
00:20:02.360 --> 00:20:04.310
Do you remember?
Taller than me.

491
00:20:04.310 --> 00:20:06.390
What was the surrounding landscape?

492
00:20:07.380 --> 00:20:09.230
Okay, well, it wasn't Felderwin.

493
00:20:12.392 --> 00:20:15.880
It wasn't terribly far,

494
00:20:15.880 --> 00:20:20.700
but I, it was a wooded area at the base

495
00:20:20.700 --> 00:20:23.760
or in some mountains, a wooded, mountainous area.

496
00:20:24.670 --> 00:20:26.490
How did you get out?

497
00:20:26.490 --> 00:20:27.323
They took me.

498
00:20:27.323 --> 00:20:28.950
The goblins were still there.

499
00:20:28.950 --> 00:20:31.390
And you saw yourself leave from this lair,

500
00:20:31.390 --> 00:20:34.850
this house at the base of the mountains?

501
00:20:34.850 --> 00:20:36.940
Well, yes, they put me in the back of,

502
00:20:37.870 --> 00:20:40.570
just some sort of a cart and tied me up--

503
00:20:40.570 --> 00:20:41.700
Get the map out--
With them.

504
00:20:41.700 --> 00:20:44.020
Get the map out.
Which one, which,

505
00:20:44.020 --> 00:20:47.050
I have so many.
The Empire.

506
00:20:47.050 --> 00:20:47.883
The Empire one.

507
00:20:47.883 --> 00:20:50.890
Well, not near, but not terribly far.

508
00:20:50.890 --> 00:20:53.050
Well, it should take us back to this river.

509
00:20:53.050 --> 00:20:53.920
Where's our Empire map?

510
00:20:53.920 --> 00:20:55.260
The river was closer to Felderwin.

511
00:20:55.260 --> 00:20:57.800
I--
No, that's beyond us.

512
00:20:57.800 --> 00:20:59.200
Well, if they didn't take you that far,

513
00:20:59.200 --> 00:21:01.070
there cannot be many mountains--

514
00:21:01.070 --> 00:21:02.200
Hang on, hang on, let's look at the map.

515
00:21:02.200 --> 00:21:03.033
Let's look at the map.

516
00:21:03.033 --> 00:21:04.960
Where's the map, Fjord?
Oh, there it is,

517
00:21:04.960 --> 00:21:06.420
there it is, okay.
I've been sharing them

518
00:21:06.420 --> 00:21:07.980
with Yasha, okay, it's not always me.

519
00:21:07.980 --> 00:21:10.800
It was days in travel, once you had been,

520
00:21:10.800 --> 00:21:13.890
once you had reawoken and they had pulled you away,

521
00:21:13.890 --> 00:21:16.190
but it, you never left.

522
00:21:16.190 --> 00:21:18.400
Once you left the mountains, you know you were in

523
00:21:18.400 --> 00:21:20.490
the Marrow Valley.
Okay.

524
00:21:21.700 --> 00:21:22.960
This is all Marrow Valley?

525
00:21:22.960 --> 00:21:24.020
Yeah, the whole Marrow Valley's

526
00:21:24.020 --> 00:21:26.750
the southern area of the Empire.

527
00:21:26.750 --> 00:21:28.054
How long did it take you to get back

528
00:21:28.054 --> 00:21:30.300
to your goblin--
I wasn't counting,

529
00:21:30.300 --> 00:21:35.300
I was mostly crying and trying to tear my bindings, and--

530
00:21:36.390 --> 00:21:39.120
Damn, your emotional state.
I know.

531
00:21:39.120 --> 00:21:41.410
A day, two, three maybe?

532
00:21:41.410 --> 00:21:46.410
Also, we were stopping frequently.

533
00:21:46.890 --> 00:21:49.100
They were doing raids on the way.

534
00:21:49.100 --> 00:21:50.940
I don't know how long it would've taken

535
00:21:50.940 --> 00:21:53.130
if we had driven straight through.

536
00:21:53.130 --> 00:21:55.170
Wait, what?

537
00:21:55.170 --> 00:21:56.030
Mm.

538
00:21:56.030 --> 00:21:57.910
Why did they take you to the river

539
00:21:57.910 --> 00:21:59.460
to drown you anyway?

540
00:21:59.460 --> 00:22:02.310
Why do you think they chose you to do this?

541
00:22:02.310 --> 00:22:05.210
Well, I had killed one of them,

542
00:22:05.210 --> 00:22:08.620
and they didn't like that very much.

543
00:22:08.620 --> 00:22:11.490
I had killed their leader,

544
00:22:13.264 --> 00:22:17.290
and in my frantic escape,

545
00:22:17.290 --> 00:22:21.680
I had killed their leader, and his wife was not

546
00:22:21.680 --> 00:22:25.890
very happy about that, and she wanted to make

547
00:22:25.890 --> 00:22:28.620
an example of me, or punish me in a way

548
00:22:28.620 --> 00:22:31.370
that was much more cruel than death.

549
00:22:33.202 --> 00:22:34.820
Hmm.

550
00:22:34.820 --> 00:22:38.470
You want to restore yourself, don't you?

551
00:22:38.470 --> 00:22:40.090
Of course.

552
00:22:40.090 --> 00:22:41.830
Then we have to go there.
Why?

553
00:22:41.830 --> 00:22:43.100
How, what are you talking about?

554
00:22:43.100 --> 00:22:44.460
We have to find this woman and kill her.

555
00:22:44.460 --> 00:22:45.340
To find this woman.

556
00:22:45.340 --> 00:22:49.900
We have to approach this village of goblins

557
00:22:49.900 --> 00:22:53.280
you're talking about, to find some sort of lead,

558
00:22:53.280 --> 00:22:55.930
or go to the place of your drowning.

559
00:22:57.350 --> 00:22:58.921
Yeah, the goblins could essentially,

560
00:22:58.921 --> 00:23:03.190
hopefully, take us back to her, point us in that direction?

561
00:23:03.190 --> 00:23:04.030
And then what?

562
00:23:04.030 --> 00:23:04.863
We have--
What was it

563
00:23:04.863 --> 00:23:05.696
you were just saying?

564
00:23:05.696 --> 00:23:08.000
I was distracted by looking at the map about some woman

565
00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:09.310
who wanted to punish you?

566
00:23:09.310 --> 00:23:10.290
What did you do, what?

567
00:23:10.290 --> 00:23:12.484
The goblins, they didn't just kill me,

568
00:23:12.484 --> 00:23:15.880
because I had, I had killed one of their own,

569
00:23:15.880 --> 00:23:17.540
their chief or whatever,

570
00:23:18.520 --> 00:23:21.340
and his wife was not very pleased,

571
00:23:21.340 --> 00:23:23.670
and so, she--
A goblin wife.

572
00:23:23.670 --> 00:23:25.450
And so that Beau can be reminded

573
00:23:25.450 --> 00:23:27.150
of things that we've already heard,

574
00:23:27.150 --> 00:23:29.690
and you killed their chief because why?

575
00:23:29.690 --> 00:23:33.000
I was escaping, I was trying to escape--

576
00:23:33.000 --> 00:23:34.367
He was trying to escape.
Yes.

577
00:23:34.367 --> 00:23:37.150
Why were you captured in the first place?

578
00:23:37.150 --> 00:23:39.680
They had captured many of us from the village,

579
00:23:39.680 --> 00:23:43.650
including my husband and my baby,

580
00:23:43.650 --> 00:23:46.650
and we escaped one night.

581
00:23:46.650 --> 00:23:51.650
I had them, we split off, because I was faster,

582
00:23:51.730 --> 00:23:52.810
and I drew--
See?

583
00:23:53.940 --> 00:23:57.100
Well, faster than, yes, I mean, he's,

584
00:23:57.100 --> 00:23:59.180
he's a bit of a nerd, you know?

585
00:23:59.180 --> 00:24:00.013
So?

586
00:24:00.013 --> 00:24:01.720
Nerds can be fast--
Nope, they can't.

587
00:24:01.720 --> 00:24:02.570
They cannot be.

588
00:24:06.860 --> 00:24:11.320
So we split up, they got away, but I was captured,

589
00:24:12.986 --> 00:24:15.553
and in my struggle, I got in a good shot.

590
00:24:18.720 --> 00:24:19.570
Sounds like it.

591
00:24:20.710 --> 00:24:23.480
Caleb's right, we should try and find these goblins again.

592
00:24:23.480 --> 00:24:25.370
I know how terrible that must be, but that would be

593
00:24:25.370 --> 00:24:26.370
the fastest way to--

594
00:24:28.140 --> 00:24:29.170
To do what, though?
Find them.

595
00:24:29.170 --> 00:24:30.690
I mean, find this woman, and what?

596
00:24:30.690 --> 00:24:32.710
Tell her to undo what she has done?

597
00:24:32.710 --> 00:24:33.543
Yeah.

598
00:24:33.543 --> 00:24:35.050
Although I--
What if I kill,

599
00:24:35.050 --> 00:24:37.440
what if we kill her, and it doesn't wear off?

600
00:24:37.440 --> 00:24:38.350
What if it's permanent?

601
00:24:38.350 --> 00:24:40.620
Well, then we will coerce her.

602
00:24:40.620 --> 00:24:41.840
We will--
Of course, yeah.

603
00:24:41.840 --> 00:24:44.580
Wait, maybe we can try a great restoration

604
00:24:44.580 --> 00:24:46.000
sort of thing and break the curse.

605
00:24:46.000 --> 00:24:47.410
Does that work?

606
00:24:47.410 --> 00:24:49.830
What would we know about this big curse?

607
00:24:50.848 --> 00:24:52.198
Does it sound like a curse?

608
00:24:54.890 --> 00:24:57.140
You can go ahead and make a religion check.

609
00:24:58.550 --> 00:25:00.440
Anything that has a residual laugh on it,

610
00:25:00.440 --> 00:25:01.590
it sure sounds like it.

611
00:25:03.090 --> 00:25:04.390
17.

612
00:25:04.390 --> 00:25:06.310
17.
I'm looking at the map.

613
00:25:06.310 --> 00:25:08.810
The nature of what prevented you from breaking

614
00:25:08.810 --> 00:25:11.740
through this spell wasn't any sort

615
00:25:11.740 --> 00:25:15.340
of abjuration based offense.

616
00:25:15.340 --> 00:25:18.380
It wasn't any sort of arcane deflection.

617
00:25:18.380 --> 00:25:20.271
This was something outside of the spectrum

618
00:25:20.271 --> 00:25:24.130
of general arcane development.

619
00:25:24.130 --> 00:25:27.000
This was something older and something with a little more

620
00:25:27.000 --> 00:25:32.000
of a divine or outside magical force

621
00:25:32.170 --> 00:25:33.550
than what you're used to dealing with,

622
00:25:33.550 --> 00:25:35.460
and the best thing you can attribute it to

623
00:25:35.460 --> 00:25:37.660
with your experience is a curse or something

624
00:25:37.660 --> 00:25:41.850
that is laid deeply within that resists a spell

625
00:25:41.850 --> 00:25:43.987
such as what you were attempting.

626
00:25:43.987 --> 00:25:45.630
It has its own rules.

627
00:25:45.630 --> 00:25:48.990
Yeah, which we have encountered curses

628
00:25:49.840 --> 00:25:53.270
to an extent before?
Lesser ones.

629
00:25:53.270 --> 00:25:54.400
Yeah, lesser ones.

630
00:25:59.670 --> 00:26:02.030
On this note, the only way to break it

631
00:26:02.030 --> 00:26:06.760
is to find the caster, is that right?

632
00:26:06.760 --> 00:26:09.020
We don't know, but what is the other--

633
00:26:09.020 --> 00:26:11.420
The spell magic!
What is the alternative?

634
00:26:11.420 --> 00:26:13.480
Whoa.
Did it work?

635
00:26:13.480 --> 00:26:14.313
I don't know.

636
00:26:14.313 --> 00:26:15.340
What level did you cast there?

637
00:26:17.040 --> 00:26:18.680
Yeah, what draws--
Six.

638
00:26:18.680 --> 00:26:20.270
Okay.
Jesus.

639
00:26:20.270 --> 00:26:22.240
You cast the spell magic on Nott.

640
00:26:22.240 --> 00:26:23.620
Yeah.

641
00:26:23.620 --> 00:26:24.790
At six level.
Okay.

642
00:26:27.160 --> 00:26:29.520
Well, did it work?

643
00:26:31.320 --> 00:26:32.940
Do you feel any different?

644
00:26:34.800 --> 00:26:36.170
You don't look any different.

645
00:26:36.170 --> 00:26:37.650
Do you have chills?

646
00:26:37.650 --> 00:26:40.434
Are they multiplying?
(laughter)

647
00:26:40.434 --> 00:26:44.288
♪ Are you losing control ♪

648
00:26:44.288 --> 00:26:45.439
I'm going to remember that.

649
00:26:45.439 --> 00:26:48.800
Okay.
(laughter)

650
00:26:48.800 --> 00:26:51.410
I feel the same.
I hate Grease.

651
00:26:51.410 --> 00:26:52.660
(laughter)
Oh boy.

652
00:26:54.060 --> 00:26:59.060
So the woman that you can remember turning you

653
00:26:59.170 --> 00:27:01.440
into this form wasn't a goblin?

654
00:27:01.440 --> 00:27:03.070
It was someone else?
No.

655
00:27:03.070 --> 00:27:04.700
No, was she, she was a human?

656
00:27:04.700 --> 00:27:05.640
She was a humanoid?

657
00:27:05.640 --> 00:27:07.800
From what I remember, humanoid.

658
00:27:07.800 --> 00:27:10.850
Older, robed.

659
00:27:13.950 --> 00:27:15.650
You were looking up at her, so it's hard

660
00:27:15.650 --> 00:27:17.760
to remember the details, and you only caught a glimpse

661
00:27:17.760 --> 00:27:19.460
of her in the surroundings, but she definitely seemed

662
00:27:19.460 --> 00:27:22.210
to be like an older humanoid, human-type face,

663
00:27:22.210 --> 00:27:25.670
but definitely deep-set lines.

664
00:27:28.380 --> 00:27:32.260
You can hear the brief instance of the laughter

665
00:27:32.260 --> 00:27:37.260
and then, the only words you recall her saying dealt with,

666
00:27:39.460 --> 00:27:42.300
a debt has been paid.

667
00:27:42.300 --> 00:27:43.250
Okay.

668
00:27:43.250 --> 00:27:44.820
I convey that to them.

669
00:27:44.820 --> 00:27:47.440
A debt has been paid, like the goblins owed her a debt?

670
00:27:47.440 --> 00:27:48.800
Or no, she owed the goblins a debt.

671
00:27:48.800 --> 00:27:49.720
She must've owed them a debt.

672
00:27:49.720 --> 00:27:51.420
That's what it sounds like it.

673
00:27:51.420 --> 00:27:56.420
This goblin wife settled up with whoever this woman was,

674
00:27:57.790 --> 00:28:02.680
and an exchange was made, and she must be close

675
00:28:03.860 --> 00:28:06.900
to that place, and otherwise, you will just have

676
00:28:06.900 --> 00:28:10.790
to throw up your hands and accept that it's the only option.

677
00:28:10.790 --> 00:28:13.839
Of course, but I mean, we would have to go

678
00:28:13.839 --> 00:28:17.980
and find the goblins who did this first,

679
00:28:17.980 --> 00:28:22.370
and there's many of them, and they move a lot.

680
00:28:22.370 --> 00:28:23.690
I've got cottonmouth.

681
00:28:23.690 --> 00:28:26.550
Does anybody want anything to drink?

682
00:28:26.550 --> 00:28:28.880
Are we still in the, where are we?

683
00:28:28.880 --> 00:28:30.330
You're still in the Essek Tower.

684
00:28:30.330 --> 00:28:31.930
We should go, why don't we go?

685
00:28:31.930 --> 00:28:33.190
Why don't we go back home?

686
00:28:33.190 --> 00:28:35.450
Go back to the Xhorhaus?

687
00:28:35.450 --> 00:28:36.960
God, I'm itchy.
What is wrong?

688
00:28:36.960 --> 00:28:37.793
Are you okay?
Itchy?

689
00:28:37.793 --> 00:28:40.320
I'm just sweaty all of a sudden.

690
00:28:40.320 --> 00:28:42.890
Let's go back to the--
You feeling sick?

691
00:28:42.890 --> 00:28:44.430
A little.
Yeah.

692
00:28:44.430 --> 00:28:45.490
We should get you back, then.

693
00:28:45.490 --> 00:28:46.323
Yeah.

694
00:28:46.323 --> 00:28:47.270
And we can pick this up there.

695
00:28:48.960 --> 00:28:51.120
She does this, it's an extreme case of syphilis

696
00:28:51.120 --> 00:28:53.950
that surfaces once in awhile, so you know,

697
00:28:53.950 --> 00:28:56.320
she takes some STD--
It's in remission.

698
00:28:56.320 --> 00:28:57.153
Yeah.
All right.

699
00:28:57.153 --> 00:28:59.760
Try to keep it under wraps, but thanks, Caleb.

700
00:28:59.760 --> 00:29:01.080
Oh, well, we are friends.

701
00:29:01.080 --> 00:29:01.913
We are.

702
00:29:01.913 --> 00:29:03.990
We are good friends, aren't we, Essek?

703
00:29:03.990 --> 00:29:04.823
Apparently.

704
00:29:06.340 --> 00:29:08.980
My apologies that this did not work in your favor.

705
00:29:09.900 --> 00:29:12.420
Thank you for helping us get this far.

706
00:29:12.420 --> 00:29:13.660
Thank you for everything.

707
00:29:13.660 --> 00:29:14.493
Yeah.

708
00:29:14.493 --> 00:29:16.150
I hope the cheese was all right.

709
00:29:16.150 --> 00:29:17.470
It was delicious.

710
00:29:17.470 --> 00:29:19.930
Your pastries could use some work,

711
00:29:19.930 --> 00:29:21.580
but the cheese was delicious.

712
00:29:21.580 --> 00:29:23.730
I accept the criticism.

713
00:29:23.730 --> 00:29:25.630
It's all right if I take a little of the cheese--

714
00:29:25.630 --> 00:29:28.060
I will punish the bakery.

715
00:29:28.060 --> 00:29:31.380
So sorry for--
Don't punish, Essek.

716
00:29:31.380 --> 00:29:33.200
Just order better things next time.

717
00:29:33.200 --> 00:29:35.874
I was attempting a joke.
Oh.

718
00:29:35.874 --> 00:29:37.040
(laughter)

719
00:29:37.040 --> 00:29:38.240
Sorry for--
You see a crack

720
00:29:38.240 --> 00:29:39.700
of a smile.
Digging up your garden

721
00:29:39.700 --> 00:29:42.550
back there, too.
Eh, it is fine.

722
00:29:42.550 --> 00:29:43.383
Easy to fix.

723
00:29:46.880 --> 00:29:48.520
Anyway.

724
00:29:48.520 --> 00:29:52.000
Sorry then to dash like this.

725
00:29:52.000 --> 00:29:52.833
Of course.

726
00:29:52.833 --> 00:29:54.420
We could also help you one day

727
00:29:54.420 --> 00:29:56.270
to put together your garden again.

728
00:29:57.190 --> 00:30:01.190
I can have some servants take care of that.

729
00:30:01.190 --> 00:30:02.023
Okay.

730
00:30:02.023 --> 00:30:03.150
We will see you soon.

731
00:30:03.150 --> 00:30:04.720
She snaps back like that.

732
00:30:04.720 --> 00:30:07.070
She's like that.
Wonderful.

733
00:30:09.870 --> 00:30:12.810
He gestures for you to make your exit.

734
00:30:14.060 --> 00:30:16.470
As you're about to leave, Caleb grabs your shoulder

735
00:30:16.470 --> 00:30:19.330
for a minute and is like, if it's at all possible,

736
00:30:21.970 --> 00:30:25.290
because I helped also with the completion of this,

737
00:30:25.290 --> 00:30:28.690
would I be able to make a copy of this,

738
00:30:28.690 --> 00:30:29.930
but for my own records?

739
00:30:30.779 --> 00:30:31.612
Of course.

740
00:30:32.460 --> 00:30:35.860
I would not have been able to do it without you.

741
00:30:35.860 --> 00:30:37.090
Wonderful.
This is your spell,

742
00:30:37.090 --> 00:30:39.300
as well as mine.
Thank you.

743
00:30:39.300 --> 00:30:41.340
And the art mages.

744
00:30:44.791 --> 00:30:46.210
All right?
You all talk

745
00:30:46.210 --> 00:30:49.660
so closely when you speak to one another.

746
00:30:49.660 --> 00:30:50.640
We didn't want to upset you.

747
00:30:50.640 --> 00:30:53.030
I know how you get when it flares like that.

748
00:30:53.030 --> 00:30:54.530
Yeah.
Let's get you home.

749
00:30:57.740 --> 00:30:59.120
And I start to walk--
Okay.

750
00:30:59.120 --> 00:30:59.953
Okay.

751
00:31:04.855 --> 00:31:07.660
All right.
Once in the street.

752
00:31:07.660 --> 00:31:09.500
Do you really have syphilis?

753
00:31:09.500 --> 00:31:10.527
I don't know.
Why is--

754
00:31:10.527 --> 00:31:13.250
Because everything was sharing a hot tub with you.

755
00:31:13.250 --> 00:31:14.430
What's going on?
Yes.

756
00:31:14.430 --> 00:31:16.140
Previously--
I feel splotchy.

757
00:31:16.140 --> 00:31:17.810
Are you okay?
You look splotchy.

758
00:31:17.810 --> 00:31:19.500
What's going on, Beau?
We're just trying to leave.

759
00:31:19.500 --> 00:31:22.080
No, I just, well, I was also just trying to leave.

760
00:31:22.080 --> 00:31:23.990
Oh my God, if there was some shit

761
00:31:23.990 --> 00:31:25.590
in the clay or something,

762
00:31:25.590 --> 00:31:26.750
Nott, how do you feel?

763
00:31:26.750 --> 00:31:28.780
Maybe there were like parasites or something.

764
00:31:28.780 --> 00:31:29.613
I don't know about that.
What the fuck

765
00:31:29.613 --> 00:31:30.446
are you talking about?

766
00:31:30.446 --> 00:31:33.790
She wasn't in the clay.
Are you actually itchy?

767
00:31:33.790 --> 00:31:38.373
No, I just, it's all freakishly familiar.

768
00:31:40.150 --> 00:31:43.550
It's reminding me of stuff that my father babbled about

769
00:31:43.550 --> 00:31:46.790
all the fucking time.
What is, my story?

770
00:31:46.790 --> 00:31:48.850
Let's take this back to the Xhorhaus.

771
00:31:50.750 --> 00:31:51.583
Ah.
Okay.

772
00:31:53.064 --> 00:31:53.897
And then, Caleb starts leading,

773
00:31:53.897 --> 00:31:55.610
just walking towards the home, in hope--

774
00:31:55.610 --> 00:31:57.490
I'm pretty sure I broke the curse on Nott,

775
00:31:57.490 --> 00:31:59.040
we should just try the spell again.

776
00:31:59.040 --> 00:32:00.390
I'm pretty sure I broke it.

777
00:32:01.900 --> 00:32:03.000
We should try it.

778
00:32:03.000 --> 00:32:07.790
Is there an actual rash happening here?

779
00:32:08.710 --> 00:32:12.060
Is Beau--
Your perception of--

780
00:32:12.060 --> 00:32:14.120
My passive perception.
Of 19.

781
00:32:14.120 --> 00:32:18.650
Is, yeah, my passive perception is like, cartoonishly--

782
00:32:20.250 --> 00:32:21.083
Yeah.

783
00:32:22.680 --> 00:32:25.380
Beyond just the red marks for her scratching,

784
00:32:25.380 --> 00:32:27.630
doesn't appear to be any sort of actual rash or--

785
00:32:27.630 --> 00:32:29.320
Just mentally itchy.

786
00:32:29.320 --> 00:32:31.150
Can I--
Strip?

787
00:32:31.150 --> 00:32:34.210
Come over and just, may I look at whatever--

788
00:32:35.629 --> 00:32:37.520
Yeah, whatever.
(laughter)

789
00:32:37.520 --> 00:32:40.670
Do you mind if I take, is that what itches over there?

790
00:32:42.242 --> 00:32:43.840
Are you actually having a rash?

791
00:32:43.840 --> 00:32:45.250
No, I think I just--

792
00:32:45.250 --> 00:32:47.370
No, these are just scratch marks, I rub Beau's arm.

793
00:32:47.370 --> 00:32:49.490
Looks like scratch marks from scratching.

794
00:32:50.780 --> 00:32:52.460
We're focusing on the wrong part

795
00:32:52.460 --> 00:32:54.018
of the role play, everybody.

796
00:32:54.018 --> 00:32:57.057
(laughter)

797
00:32:57.057 --> 00:32:59.434
So she's mental--
Allergic to a fabric or--

798
00:32:59.434 --> 00:33:00.820
(laughter)
is it--

799
00:33:00.820 --> 00:33:04.110
Started wearing--
Do you have an EpiPen?

800
00:33:04.110 --> 00:33:06.280
EpiPen--
Of course I carry an EpiPen.

801
00:33:06.280 --> 00:33:07.690
Don't touch that chair.

802
00:33:07.690 --> 00:33:09.420
So are we back at the Xhorhaus yet?

803
00:33:09.420 --> 00:33:11.470
Yes, oh here we are at the Xhorhaus.

804
00:33:11.470 --> 00:33:12.770
Beau--
Let's make sure

805
00:33:12.770 --> 00:33:15.650
we don't come in contact with any synthetic fabrics.

806
00:33:15.650 --> 00:33:17.840
Need an antihistamine?
Go sit down.

807
00:33:17.840 --> 00:33:18.720
Go sit down.

808
00:33:18.720 --> 00:33:20.100
Both of you, sit down.

809
00:33:20.100 --> 00:33:22.510
I think, in this instance, we should definitely focus

810
00:33:22.510 --> 00:33:25.690
on Beau, because she's in way worse shape than I am.

811
00:33:26.880 --> 00:33:28.730
An oatmeal bath or something.

812
00:33:28.730 --> 00:33:30.240
Here.

813
00:33:30.240 --> 00:33:32.490
No, no, wait, that's not, no.

814
00:33:32.490 --> 00:33:33.323
What is that?

815
00:33:33.323 --> 00:33:34.156
What do you have?

816
00:33:34.156 --> 00:33:34.989
What do you have--

817
00:33:34.989 --> 00:33:36.750
You said you had cottonmouth.

818
00:33:36.750 --> 00:33:38.480
Yeah.
Oh yeah.

819
00:33:38.480 --> 00:33:40.350
We just a--
It's just a lot of--

820
00:33:41.510 --> 00:33:42.343
Sorry.

821
00:33:42.343 --> 00:33:43.176
She didn't say?

822
00:33:43.176 --> 00:33:44.009
Now it's trumpet.

823
00:33:45.963 --> 00:33:49.166
Where do you find all these instrument skills?

824
00:33:49.166 --> 00:33:52.760
(laughter)

825
00:33:52.760 --> 00:33:56.770
I have learned that a trumpet helps with cottonmouth.

826
00:33:56.770 --> 00:33:59.170
Oh.
Saliva going--

827
00:33:59.170 --> 00:34:03.007
Saliva going.
Yep. (blowing)

828
00:34:03.007 --> 00:34:05.461
(Beau imitating a dying trumpet)

829
00:34:05.461 --> 00:34:06.420
Rewind, rewind, rewind.

830
00:34:06.420 --> 00:34:07.253
Wow.

831
00:34:09.214 --> 00:34:10.165
Talk about it.

832
00:34:10.165 --> 00:34:12.680
You said that it reminded you of something.

833
00:34:12.680 --> 00:34:13.513
What?

834
00:34:14.890 --> 00:34:19.360
My dad said he made a deal with a woman,

835
00:34:20.530 --> 00:34:25.530
in the woods, like an old fortune teller woman.

836
00:34:27.050 --> 00:34:28.050
Okay?

837
00:34:28.050 --> 00:34:32.550
Did he say she had a weird laugh, or that she was in robes

838
00:34:32.550 --> 00:34:34.390
and she did something with goblins?

839
00:34:34.390 --> 00:34:37.580
What was the deal for?

840
00:34:37.580 --> 00:34:41.890
He wanted to be successful, and to be wealthy,

841
00:34:44.768 --> 00:34:48.060
and to have the ability to marry my mother.

842
00:34:48.060 --> 00:34:52.420
He was just a poor asshole street urchin

843
00:34:53.460 --> 00:34:56.440
who was in love with this lady of the town.

844
00:34:57.780 --> 00:34:58.613
And it worked?

845
00:35:00.360 --> 00:35:02.090
In a way.

846
00:35:02.090 --> 00:35:06.890
It's, he built his entire fucking life

847
00:35:06.890 --> 00:35:09.320
around this fortune teller,

848
00:35:09.320 --> 00:35:13.170
around a fucking tarot deck, basically.

849
00:35:13.170 --> 00:35:14.950
But did it work, is he rich?

850
00:35:14.950 --> 00:35:16.250
Is he married to your mom?

851
00:35:17.230 --> 00:35:18.630
Yeah.
She, yeah.

852
00:35:18.630 --> 00:35:23.010
But he, she said that he would just,

853
00:35:24.730 --> 00:35:28.000
he would be successful and that she told him

854
00:35:28.000 --> 00:35:31.550
that he should start, he should buy a plot of land

855
00:35:31.550 --> 00:35:36.240
and just try farming, and he ended up buying

856
00:35:36.240 --> 00:35:38.310
this shitty piece of land that no one wanted

857
00:35:38.310 --> 00:35:39.970
because they couldn't grow anything,

858
00:35:39.970 --> 00:35:41.940
and he was able to get grapes to grow,

859
00:35:41.940 --> 00:35:45.360
and then, he turned it into this really successful winery,

860
00:35:45.360 --> 00:35:47.720
but he busted his ass doing it.

861
00:35:51.102 --> 00:35:54.367
It wasn't that he had fortune, or the future told.

862
00:35:56.130 --> 00:35:59.200
He just--
But what about the woman?

863
00:35:59.200 --> 00:36:01.390
It sounds like--
What did she--

864
00:36:02.570 --> 00:36:03.403
Did he say--
Why do you think--

865
00:36:03.403 --> 00:36:04.410
How he found her?

866
00:36:04.410 --> 00:36:05.780
Like how, who--
Did she talk

867
00:36:05.780 --> 00:36:07.360
about debts or something?

868
00:36:09.760 --> 00:36:13.200
Also, you two live very far away from each other.

869
00:36:13.200 --> 00:36:14.820
Do you?
Many fairy tales

870
00:36:14.820 --> 00:36:16.940
with an old crone in the woods.

871
00:36:16.940 --> 00:36:18.320
Well, here's the thing.

872
00:36:18.320 --> 00:36:20.050
You're up here, right?

873
00:36:20.050 --> 00:36:21.330
Where are you, Beau?

874
00:36:21.330 --> 00:36:23.250
Yeah, protocol--
Beau is here.

875
00:36:23.250 --> 00:36:26.100
Felderwin is over here.
Yeah, but if she lives

876
00:36:26.100 --> 00:36:27.490
in the mountains or something,

877
00:36:27.490 --> 00:36:29.130
maybe Beau's--
Yeah, they're only

878
00:36:29.130 --> 00:36:30.622
like four inches from each other.

879
00:36:30.622 --> 00:36:31.455
(laughter)

880
00:36:31.455 --> 00:36:32.288
Should we ask your dad?

881
00:36:32.288 --> 00:36:34.130
Is this Mount Mentiri?

882
00:36:34.130 --> 00:36:35.360
What is Mount Mentiri?

883
00:36:35.360 --> 00:36:36.780
Right around--
What is that,

884
00:36:36.780 --> 00:36:38.320
what does that mean?
This is Mount Mentiri.

885
00:36:38.320 --> 00:36:39.850
Mount Mentiri actually is right

886
00:36:39.850 --> 00:36:42.130
in this region.
See?

887
00:36:42.130 --> 00:36:44.540
That's days, that's a day, that's a couple days

888
00:36:44.540 --> 00:36:47.170
traveling from Felderwin.
I mean--

889
00:36:47.170 --> 00:36:48.250
Yeah.
We really--

890
00:36:48.250 --> 00:36:50.040
Is that where he met this woman?

891
00:36:50.040 --> 00:36:52.530
He said he walked on foot,

892
00:36:52.530 --> 00:36:56.500
he heard about some woman who could trade.

893
00:36:56.500 --> 00:36:58.570
She had a home in the woods, in the mountains?

894
00:36:58.570 --> 00:37:01.060
She had a home in the woods, and he just walked barefoot

895
00:37:01.060 --> 00:37:02.920
until he eventually found her.

896
00:37:02.920 --> 00:37:04.630
I'm setting up a little circle.

897
00:37:04.630 --> 00:37:07.920
And she, he asked how he could find his own wealth,

898
00:37:09.421 --> 00:37:13.860
and she told him that he would be successful,

899
00:37:13.860 --> 00:37:15.800
and that he would have a successful winery,

900
00:37:15.800 --> 00:37:17.500
and that he would marry the woman he loved,

901
00:37:17.500 --> 00:37:21.060
and that he would birth a young beau

902
00:37:21.060 --> 00:37:23.930
to inherit the family business.

903
00:37:23.930 --> 00:37:26.080
Well, he didn't do that--
And he took it so literally

904
00:37:26.080 --> 00:37:27.530
that he named me Beau.

905
00:37:28.550 --> 00:37:31.400
Wow, your dad is super superstitious.

906
00:37:31.400 --> 00:37:32.460
Yep.

907
00:37:32.460 --> 00:37:35.450
This piece of jade that he gave me,

908
00:37:35.450 --> 00:37:38.930
it's the only thing that I keep on me.

909
00:37:38.930 --> 00:37:41.250
It's the only real gift he ever gave me,

910
00:37:41.250 --> 00:37:42.630
because he thought it would protect me.

911
00:37:42.630 --> 00:37:44.670
What was it--
He always gave me

912
00:37:44.670 --> 00:37:47.090
good luck trinkets.
Interesting.

913
00:37:47.090 --> 00:37:48.410
It's a piece of jade?
Are you sure

914
00:37:48.410 --> 00:37:49.990
it's just a good luck trinket?

915
00:37:52.349 --> 00:37:54.220
It's just a piece, it's just a jade necklace.

916
00:37:54.220 --> 00:37:55.920
Holy shit, you never checked?

917
00:37:55.920 --> 00:37:57.130
Ooh, Caleb, check it out.

918
00:37:57.130 --> 00:37:59.240
Is it expensive?
I feel like, okay,

919
00:37:59.240 --> 00:38:02.670
you know, it's been a rough day, but in the last six hours

920
00:38:02.670 --> 00:38:05.650
we've learned that Caduceus and Fjord are brothers.

921
00:38:05.650 --> 00:38:07.260
We've not known that.
And that,

922
00:38:07.260 --> 00:38:09.570
we've learned everything about you and me.

923
00:38:09.570 --> 00:38:11.080
Maybe we should all just say everything

924
00:38:11.080 --> 00:38:12.220
that's ever happened to us--

925
00:38:12.220 --> 00:38:13.940
I've told my story before.
In our lives.

926
00:38:13.940 --> 00:38:15.190
Well, I've told my story before.

927
00:38:15.190 --> 00:38:16.690
Why didn't you hear it before?

928
00:38:18.180 --> 00:38:22.730
Because it, a woman dousing you in a river

929
00:38:22.730 --> 00:38:24.250
could be any old woman.

930
00:38:24.250 --> 00:38:26.060
I didn't, I don't know.

931
00:38:26.060 --> 00:38:27.423
It's hard to hear on this side of the table.

932
00:38:27.423 --> 00:38:30.944
(laughter)

933
00:38:30.944 --> 00:38:33.100
I have begun casting Commune.

934
00:38:33.100 --> 00:38:34.609
Okay.

935
00:38:34.609 --> 00:38:36.150
I thought it was a coincidence.

936
00:38:36.150 --> 00:38:41.150
I didn't think it had any merits to connect our pasts.

937
00:38:43.460 --> 00:38:45.570
It sounded vague enough, I don't know.

938
00:38:45.570 --> 00:38:47.372
How can, can you ask your father what this--

939
00:38:47.372 --> 00:38:48.860
Yeah, would you--
Woman looked like?

940
00:38:48.860 --> 00:38:49.990
What was her name?

941
00:38:49.990 --> 00:38:54.990
Or where she was found, or, can you send him a message?

942
00:38:56.020 --> 00:38:57.480
You can--
I'll send him a message.

943
00:38:57.480 --> 00:38:59.730
Father, her father?
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

944
00:38:59.730 --> 00:39:00.563
Yeah, it freaks him out.

945
00:39:00.563 --> 00:39:04.490
Okay, okay, okay, what if I send him a message,

946
00:39:04.490 --> 00:39:05.930
I pretend to be the old woman--

947
00:39:05.930 --> 00:39:06.990
Of course, that's a no-brainer.

948
00:39:06.990 --> 00:39:07.840
Yeah.
Didn't you do that

949
00:39:07.840 --> 00:39:09.360
once already?
Well, I didn't know

950
00:39:09.360 --> 00:39:11.280
who I was pretending to be, I just spit a little,

951
00:39:11.280 --> 00:39:13.770
but I didn't know who I was pretending to be,

952
00:39:14.800 --> 00:39:17.410
but this time, I will pretend to be the old woman.

953
00:39:17.410 --> 00:39:20.760
So you just say, "Hi, I'm the old woman who--"

954
00:39:20.760 --> 00:39:23.090
What's my name?
What's my name

955
00:39:23.090 --> 00:39:24.630
and where do I live?
Where do I live?

956
00:39:24.630 --> 00:39:26.090
Tell me that.

957
00:39:26.090 --> 00:39:29.760
If you can tell me that, you're free from all your curses.

958
00:39:29.760 --> 00:39:31.570
Can I do that?

959
00:39:31.570 --> 00:39:32.870
About that moment, you see Caduceus,

960
00:39:32.870 --> 00:39:36.850
who has prepared a small circle of trinkets, implements

961
00:39:36.850 --> 00:39:40.650
that are on the ground, fall into a momentary trace.

962
00:39:41.660 --> 00:39:45.610
Caduceus, all the sounds of chatting and bickering

963
00:39:45.610 --> 00:39:49.099
and confused, raised voices here in the house begin to fade,

964
00:39:49.099 --> 00:39:53.150
as you feel the familiar warm breeze blow over you.

965
00:39:53.150 --> 00:39:55.310
You can sense the clouds above traveling

966
00:39:55.310 --> 00:39:57.740
at a far greater speed.

967
00:39:57.740 --> 00:39:59.370
Time begins to accelerate,

968
00:39:59.370 --> 00:40:01.740
but slow to a crawl simultaneously,

969
00:40:01.740 --> 00:40:06.740
and you feel the warm, familiar presence of your protector.

970
00:40:12.960 --> 00:40:16.040
Does the woman who cursed Nott live?

971
00:40:19.840 --> 00:40:24.000
The breeze comes cold and biting,

972
00:40:24.000 --> 00:40:27.690
not in a way to deny it, but in a way that shivers

973
00:40:27.690 --> 00:40:28.790
the truth through you.

974
00:40:33.290 --> 00:40:37.360
Has this creature ever had a conversation

975
00:40:37.360 --> 00:40:38.320
with Beau's father?

976
00:40:42.340 --> 00:40:45.690
The cold breeze rescinds,

977
00:40:45.690 --> 00:40:48.602
and then, blows with equal strength.

978
00:40:48.602 --> 00:40:52.240
Oh.
(tense music)

979
00:40:52.240 --> 00:40:53.466
Was that a yes or a no?

980
00:40:53.466 --> 00:40:55.399
I think it's a no.
Can't you read wind?

981
00:40:55.399 --> 00:40:57.582
(laughter)

982
00:40:57.582 --> 00:40:59.291
That's a yes from me.
(Jester blowing)

983
00:40:59.291 --> 00:41:02.791
(laughter)

984
00:41:13.110 --> 00:41:18.110
Does my family wait for me at the Menagerie?

985
00:41:18.269 --> 00:41:20.769
(tense music)

986
00:41:22.490 --> 00:41:24.770
The cold breeze comes once more,

987
00:41:24.770 --> 00:41:27.410
but this time, it turns warm,

988
00:41:27.410 --> 00:41:32.410
to confirm, as well, but this answer with less intensity.

989
00:41:36.620 --> 00:41:39.000
But all confirmations nonetheless.

990
00:41:39.000 --> 00:41:42.950
Okay, good.
(tense music)

991
00:41:45.915 --> 00:41:48.380
(sighing) I regret my weakness.

992
00:41:49.360 --> 00:41:50.450
What did you learn, Caduceus?

993
00:41:50.450 --> 00:41:51.550
What does that mean?

994
00:41:52.460 --> 00:41:54.830
We need to go see your father.

995
00:41:54.830 --> 00:41:57.160
What do you mean, you regret your weakness?

996
00:41:57.160 --> 00:41:58.460
Oh, that wasn't for you.

997
00:42:01.004 --> 00:42:01.880
Uh-huh.

998
00:42:01.880 --> 00:42:03.080
We need to talk to your father.

999
00:42:03.080 --> 00:42:05.270
I don't want to?

1000
00:42:06.170 --> 00:42:07.690
Oh, yeah, but if we talk to your dad,

1001
00:42:07.690 --> 00:42:09.490
we don't have to go see the goblins.

1002
00:42:10.660 --> 00:42:12.920
More to the point, we don't know where the goblins are,

1003
00:42:12.920 --> 00:42:14.720
but we do know where your father is.

1004
00:42:17.056 --> 00:42:18.550
If you don't want to talk to your father,

1005
00:42:18.550 --> 00:42:19.430
I could do it.

1006
00:42:19.430 --> 00:42:21.870
Hi, I'm Beau, I don't give a fuck.

1007
00:42:21.870 --> 00:42:23.210
Fuck you, Dad.

1008
00:42:23.210 --> 00:42:24.483
It's pretty good, actually.

1009
00:42:24.483 --> 00:42:25.480
(laughter)

1010
00:42:25.480 --> 00:42:27.700
When was the last time that you saw your dad?

1011
00:42:31.333 --> 00:42:33.570
The night he slapped me across the face

1012
00:42:33.570 --> 00:42:35.670
as I was getting drug out by the monks.

1013
00:42:35.670 --> 00:42:37.060
Ooh.

1014
00:42:37.060 --> 00:42:38.910
He slapped you as you were leaving?

1015
00:42:39.960 --> 00:42:40.793
Yeah.

1016
00:42:41.715 --> 00:42:43.120
I really don't like your dad.

1017
00:42:43.120 --> 00:42:45.060
Yeah, I'm starting to like him even less

1018
00:42:45.060 --> 00:42:46.260
than I did before.

1019
00:42:49.250 --> 00:42:50.500
He's a complicated man.

1020
00:42:53.426 --> 00:42:55.926
I don't know, that didn't sound too complicated.

1021
00:42:59.320 --> 00:43:04.320
Yeah, but for our friend, would you, would you?

1022
00:43:07.280 --> 00:43:08.113
Yeah.

1023
00:43:10.540 --> 00:43:11.740
Thank you, Beauregard.

1024
00:43:12.980 --> 00:43:13.880
Yes, thank you.

1025
00:43:16.980 --> 00:43:19.750
But do we need to go there in person?

1026
00:43:19.750 --> 00:43:21.010
It's very far away.

1027
00:43:22.040 --> 00:43:24.380
It's kind of close to Rexxentrum.

1028
00:43:25.489 --> 00:43:27.120
How would we not go there in person?

1029
00:43:27.120 --> 00:43:28.720
Closest to Zadash--

1030
00:43:28.720 --> 00:43:31.280
Could we just send a message or?

1031
00:43:32.680 --> 00:43:35.640
If we're going to go find her, we going to go there anyway.

1032
00:43:35.640 --> 00:43:36.473
It's true.

1033
00:43:36.473 --> 00:43:37.900
Yeah, we need to go to that region.

1034
00:43:37.900 --> 00:43:39.943
We could warn your father that we are coming.

1035
00:43:39.943 --> 00:43:41.420
I could take us to Zadash.

1036
00:43:41.420 --> 00:43:43.160
We could travel on foot.

1037
00:43:43.160 --> 00:43:44.790
Well, I don't know if this is a conversation

1038
00:43:44.790 --> 00:43:46.330
I want to have in 25 words.

1039
00:43:47.170 --> 00:43:48.460
We should go in person.

1040
00:43:48.460 --> 00:43:50.920
You want to just show up at the doorstep?

1041
00:43:50.920 --> 00:43:53.380
Wait, wait--
He threw me off the doorstep

1042
00:43:53.380 --> 00:43:57.310
so why can't I just fucking show up?

1043
00:43:57.310 --> 00:43:58.780
That's right.
I'll also point out--

1044
00:43:58.780 --> 00:44:00.420
Show him.
You'd probably,

1045
00:44:00.420 --> 00:44:01.990
you'd have a hard time throwing you off

1046
00:44:01.990 --> 00:44:03.650
the doorstep again at this point.

1047
00:44:03.650 --> 00:44:04.483
That's true.

1048
00:44:04.483 --> 00:44:07.050
We could throw him off the doorstep,

1049
00:44:07.050 --> 00:44:09.460
and slap him across the face, right as we do it.

1050
00:44:10.310 --> 00:44:12.542
But also, being nice enough so that he'll tell us

1051
00:44:12.542 --> 00:44:13.730
the information that we're--

1052
00:44:13.730 --> 00:44:16.110
We can make him talk if we're mean.

1053
00:44:18.120 --> 00:44:20.050
Jesus.
In all seriousness,

1054
00:44:20.050 --> 00:44:23.380
I do have it on pretty good authority

1055
00:44:23.380 --> 00:44:25.960
that there is something to be gained,

1056
00:44:26.820 --> 00:44:30.830
of seeing one's parents once we've matured enough

1057
00:44:30.830 --> 00:44:32.230
to see how fragile they are.

1058
00:44:34.980 --> 00:44:36.390
I appreciate all of you,

1059
00:44:38.920 --> 00:44:43.610
you know, committing to go and do these things on my behalf

1060
00:44:43.610 --> 00:44:46.090
but we had a plan, we have a plan.

1061
00:44:46.090 --> 00:44:50.207
We're going to Caduceus' family and we're going to meet,

1062
00:44:50.207 --> 00:44:53.130
we have to, I think we've, have we sent the boat

1063
00:44:53.130 --> 00:44:54.520
to meet us already or no?

1064
00:44:55.550 --> 00:44:57.210
It's weeks away.

1065
00:44:57.210 --> 00:44:58.760
Weeks.
We still have time.

1066
00:44:59.830 --> 00:45:03.750
But this is the other direction by thousands of miles.

1067
00:45:03.750 --> 00:45:04.583
Not really.

1068
00:45:06.560 --> 00:45:07.560
It is, though.

1069
00:45:08.440 --> 00:45:10.130
The Menagerie is where?

1070
00:45:10.130 --> 00:45:11.810
South, straight down.

1071
00:45:11.810 --> 00:45:14.740
I can just tell Orly, it's been like what, an hour,

1072
00:45:14.740 --> 00:45:16.830
he hasn't left yet, I can tell Orly,

1073
00:45:16.830 --> 00:45:18.260
hey, don't meet us there.

1074
00:45:18.260 --> 00:45:20.320
Meet us in Nicodranas.

1075
00:45:20.320 --> 00:45:24.330
It's not just, it's not just about that.

1076
00:45:27.737 --> 00:45:28.950
I mean, there's no immediacy.

1077
00:45:28.950 --> 00:45:31.540
We don't have to find this woman today.

1078
00:45:31.540 --> 00:45:33.540
Caduceus, you are on a path.

1079
00:45:36.520 --> 00:45:38.420
I don't know if I'm quite ready yet.

1080
00:45:40.240 --> 00:45:41.860
You seemed to be.

1081
00:45:41.860 --> 00:45:42.693
Hmm.

1082
00:45:44.173 --> 00:45:45.006
I don't know.

1083
00:45:45.969 --> 00:45:47.270
I mean, it's not just you, either.

1084
00:45:47.270 --> 00:45:49.257
You've got a brother now.

1085
00:45:49.257 --> 00:45:52.530
(Beau laughing)

1086
00:45:52.530 --> 00:45:55.290
Mm, mm, mm.
I mean, he wants

1087
00:45:55.290 --> 00:45:56.870
to meet his family, too.

1088
00:45:56.870 --> 00:45:59.060
No, it's not, no, nope.

1089
00:46:00.600 --> 00:46:02.370
I see the resemblance.

1090
00:46:04.270 --> 00:46:08.020
Listen, you can't deny the immense coincidence involved.

1091
00:46:08.020 --> 00:46:09.370
Of course, yes.

1092
00:46:11.000 --> 00:46:12.790
That has to mean something.

1093
00:46:12.790 --> 00:46:14.480
I don't think it does.

1094
00:46:14.480 --> 00:46:15.720
I think it does mean something.

1095
00:46:15.720 --> 00:46:18.520
I just don't necessarily think we know what it means,

1096
00:46:24.825 --> 00:46:27.780
and I've--
(laughter)

1097
00:46:29.119 --> 00:46:31.270
I mean, it's pretty obvious.

1098
00:46:31.270 --> 00:46:34.170
No, it really isn't.
You got the same nose.

1099
00:46:34.170 --> 00:46:35.850
We really don't.
No.

1100
00:46:35.850 --> 00:46:38.630
He is a total different--
Literally,

1101
00:46:38.630 --> 00:46:39.940
it couldn't be more different.

1102
00:46:39.940 --> 00:46:41.300
His hair is far better than mine.

1103
00:46:41.300 --> 00:46:42.850
Accents are the same.
Thank you.

1104
00:46:42.850 --> 00:46:44.750
I like your hair.
You share a comb.

1105
00:46:45.720 --> 00:46:46.980
Yeah.
Well, that.

1106
00:46:47.950 --> 00:46:49.130
Not just that.
No.

1107
00:46:49.130 --> 00:46:51.120
It's a lot.
Yeah, it's a lot.

1108
00:46:51.120 --> 00:46:54.750
And sometimes, coincidences are just coincidences.

1109
00:46:54.750 --> 00:46:55.700
Exactly.

1110
00:46:55.700 --> 00:46:58.290
Sometimes, though, it means that, you know,

1111
00:46:58.290 --> 00:47:00.270
your dad interacted with the person

1112
00:47:00.270 --> 00:47:03.250
that cursed your friend.

1113
00:47:03.250 --> 00:47:04.360
Do we know that for sure?

1114
00:47:04.360 --> 00:47:05.193
Or is that--
Yeah.

1115
00:47:05.193 --> 00:47:08.030
We just got confirmation from the Wildmother.

1116
00:47:08.030 --> 00:47:09.370
Yes.
Yeah, I mean--

1117
00:47:09.370 --> 00:47:11.020
We're going the right direction.

1118
00:47:11.020 --> 00:47:13.430
Fjord talked to The Wild, oh, I'm sorry.

1119
00:47:13.430 --> 00:47:14.920
You're Caduceus.

1120
00:47:14.920 --> 00:47:16.620
I get them mixed up sometimes,

1121
00:47:16.620 --> 00:47:20.558
because they're so similar.
(laughter)

1122
00:47:20.558 --> 00:47:21.620
It's bothered me.

1123
00:47:21.620 --> 00:47:24.740
I've been trying to think of a way to help you through it

1124
00:47:24.740 --> 00:47:27.350
for a long while, Nott, and what I can do to,

1125
00:47:28.720 --> 00:47:31.200
everyone else is easier to help with their struggles.

1126
00:47:31.200 --> 00:47:35.550
You are complicated, and it's been difficult in this,

1127
00:47:35.550 --> 00:47:38.540
and it's nice to finally have a path forward,

1128
00:47:38.540 --> 00:47:40.270
and there's a way to help you.

1129
00:47:40.270 --> 00:47:42.880
Yes, plus what if this is not the only hold

1130
00:47:42.880 --> 00:47:44.760
that she has over you?

1131
00:47:44.760 --> 00:47:47.770
I mean, she prevented the tremendously powerful spell

1132
00:47:47.770 --> 00:47:48.603
from taking effect.

1133
00:47:48.603 --> 00:47:50.840
What if there's something else?

1134
00:47:50.840 --> 00:47:52.760
We have to find out what leads to.

1135
00:47:52.760 --> 00:47:56.040
We don't have to confront your dad,

1136
00:47:56.040 --> 00:47:57.060
or even involve you,

1137
00:47:57.060 --> 00:47:58.330
if you're really uncomfortable about it.

1138
00:47:58.330 --> 00:47:59.670
We're not forcing anybody to do anything,

1139
00:47:59.670 --> 00:48:03.050
but I think we need to clear your ledger.

1140
00:48:03.050 --> 00:48:04.850
You do have access to the library,

1141
00:48:05.940 --> 00:48:07.360
to research if you wanted to.

1142
00:48:07.360 --> 00:48:08.450
In Zadash?

1143
00:48:08.450 --> 00:48:10.060
Well, in pretty much any of the Cobalt Soul Libraries,

1144
00:48:10.060 --> 00:48:11.710
but that's the nearest one there.

1145
00:48:13.538 --> 00:48:16.290
It's all you, we have been working toward.

1146
00:48:16.290 --> 00:48:19.710
I know, but, I don't know, if I'm being honest,

1147
00:48:19.710 --> 00:48:24.230
we got so close, and I think I had a little bit

1148
00:48:24.230 --> 00:48:25.550
of a cold feet.

1149
00:48:27.940 --> 00:48:30.090
What do you mean?
How do you feel now?

1150
00:48:31.450 --> 00:48:34.240
You got really close, you committed to it.

1151
00:48:34.240 --> 00:48:36.520
I know.
Do you feel relief?

1152
00:48:36.520 --> 00:48:37.570
A little bit, yeah.

1153
00:48:40.130 --> 00:48:41.950
Sometimes, when you play eenie, meenie, miney moe,

1154
00:48:41.950 --> 00:48:43.420
because you don't know which choice you want,

1155
00:48:43.420 --> 00:48:45.370
and then, you get to the moe,

1156
00:48:45.370 --> 00:48:48.250
and then, you know, at the end, if you wanted the thing

1157
00:48:48.250 --> 00:48:50.040
or if you didn't want the thing by what you land on.

1158
00:48:50.040 --> 00:48:51.090
You know what I mean?

1159
00:48:52.040 --> 00:48:53.840
It makes the choice for you, when you find out

1160
00:48:53.840 --> 00:48:54.673
what you can and can't do.

1161
00:48:54.673 --> 00:48:57.330
I know what you mean.
I do know what you mean.

1162
00:49:01.160 --> 00:49:02.110
But--
Well, but.

1163
00:49:05.310 --> 00:49:07.680
I mean, I can't, I have to pursue it.

1164
00:49:09.158 --> 00:49:10.990
I do want to be me again.

1165
00:49:12.050 --> 00:49:14.450
It's just, it was happening so fast.

1166
00:49:14.450 --> 00:49:16.640
It was a little scary.

1167
00:49:18.290 --> 00:49:20.310
I mean, Caduceus, you said you're not ready yet.

1168
00:49:20.310 --> 00:49:22.340
I don't know if I'm ready yet.

1169
00:49:24.630 --> 00:49:26.970
I don't know if I'm ready to see my dad yet,

1170
00:49:26.970 --> 00:49:31.207
but that's a bunch of us waiting

1171
00:49:32.360 --> 00:49:34.660
for something to happen to us.

1172
00:49:34.660 --> 00:49:37.880
And I've accepted the inevitability that when we head

1173
00:49:37.880 --> 00:49:42.230
towards the Traveler that we're going to be

1174
00:49:42.230 --> 00:49:44.970
right where I need to be, and that's inevitable.

1175
00:49:44.970 --> 00:49:46.590
That's gravity pulling me there.

1176
00:49:47.600 --> 00:49:51.300
I don't, I think we have to spend the time before that

1177
00:49:51.300 --> 00:49:53.200
doing as much as we can for everybody.

1178
00:49:54.678 --> 00:49:57.150
How long has it been, Beau, since you've seen your father?

1179
00:49:57.150 --> 00:49:59.430
How many years?

1180
00:49:59.430 --> 00:50:00.570
Two, three?

1181
00:50:01.770 --> 00:50:03.816
Close to three years.
Three?

1182
00:50:03.816 --> 00:50:05.860
A lot can happen in that amount of time.

1183
00:50:07.740 --> 00:50:08.990
How would we get there?

1184
00:50:10.000 --> 00:50:12.380
Teleport.
We teleport to Zadash.

1185
00:50:12.380 --> 00:50:14.240
It's still days away.

1186
00:50:14.240 --> 00:50:15.370
A couple of days.
A few days,

1187
00:50:15.370 --> 00:50:19.210
but that would take us to Nicodranas.

1188
00:50:19.210 --> 00:50:20.860
It's not that far on horseback.

1189
00:50:22.330 --> 00:50:23.980
I know, I've done the trek.

1190
00:50:25.050 --> 00:50:26.250
Yeah, we ride.

1191
00:50:26.250 --> 00:50:28.300
Has he reached out to you since?

1192
00:50:30.840 --> 00:50:32.440
I got a letter from my mother,

1193
00:50:34.160 --> 00:50:36.870
about six months or so, maybe more,

1194
00:50:37.830 --> 00:50:39.080
being at the Cobalt Soul,

1195
00:50:46.303 --> 00:50:47.953
saying that they had been granted

1196
00:50:49.470 --> 00:50:51.370
their greatest wish and had a son.

1197
00:50:55.700 --> 00:50:57.900
Named him Thoreau, Jr. After my father.

1198
00:51:00.440 --> 00:51:01.640
How many guys you got?

1199
00:51:02.868 --> 00:51:04.268
I guess he's like two now.

1200
00:51:06.960 --> 00:51:08.560
You've never met your brother?

1201
00:51:10.600 --> 00:51:11.433
Do you want to?

1202
00:51:14.090 --> 00:51:16.210
It's hard to even think of him as my brother.

1203
00:51:17.140 --> 00:51:17.973
Why?

1204
00:51:19.400 --> 00:51:21.540
No connection or contacts for the kid.

1205
00:51:23.470 --> 00:51:25.761
He's just a name and a letter.

1206
00:51:25.761 --> 00:51:26.880
Do you wonder if, when you see him,

1207
00:51:26.880 --> 00:51:27.930
you'll feel that way?

1208
00:51:29.070 --> 00:51:29.903
Maybe.

1209
00:51:31.080 --> 00:51:34.760
You said that the woman told your father

1210
00:51:34.760 --> 00:51:36.090
that he would have a beau,

1211
00:51:37.740 --> 00:51:39.550
and that that would do what?

1212
00:51:40.750 --> 00:51:45.660
That that would complete the spell or what is that?

1213
00:51:45.660 --> 00:51:47.860
Young beau to take on his name,

1214
00:51:48.910 --> 00:51:52.920
continue his bloodline, and take over his family business

1215
00:51:52.920 --> 00:51:56.440
and all of those things, and--

1216
00:51:56.440 --> 00:51:57.760
But beau means like--
Boy.

1217
00:51:57.760 --> 00:51:59.730
Your boyfriend or something.

1218
00:51:59.730 --> 00:52:01.500
Or boy.
Oh, it's just a boy?

1219
00:52:01.500 --> 00:52:02.340
I think so.

1220
00:52:02.340 --> 00:52:05.250
It has a few different interpretations.

1221
00:52:05.250 --> 00:52:07.150
And he thought he was getting a boy,

1222
00:52:09.050 --> 00:52:11.640
so as soon as my mom got pregnant,

1223
00:52:11.640 --> 00:52:13.760
he got really set on that son.

1224
00:52:15.880 --> 00:52:17.820
And you know, for a long time,

1225
00:52:20.370 --> 00:52:22.470
I tried to bend my life to what he wanted.

1226
00:52:23.670 --> 00:52:26.840
I was willing to take over the family business.

1227
00:52:30.390 --> 00:52:31.970
I just wanted to do it my way,

1228
00:52:34.060 --> 00:52:35.280
and he didn't want that.

1229
00:52:36.712 --> 00:52:38.260
What does your way look like?

1230
00:52:42.650 --> 00:52:46.110
I liked traveling and fighting,

1231
00:52:48.026 --> 00:52:49.600
and talking to people, so.

1232
00:52:51.790 --> 00:52:55.670
I wanted to take the Lionett wine,

1233
00:52:55.670 --> 00:52:57.720
and take it to neighboring cities,

1234
00:52:57.720 --> 00:53:01.400
and expand it into Zadash, and we'd get this big name

1235
00:53:01.400 --> 00:53:05.520
and I tried to convince him several times to load up a cart

1236
00:53:05.520 --> 00:53:08.240
and a couple of horses, and give me a few crates

1237
00:53:08.240 --> 00:53:11.600
and let me take off and see what I could do,

1238
00:53:11.600 --> 00:53:13.710
selling crates to different taverns,

1239
00:53:13.710 --> 00:53:15.110
of anyone who would take it.

1240
00:53:17.008 --> 00:53:19.000
And he thought that that was a useless waste of time,

1241
00:53:19.000 --> 00:53:22.450
and that I would get hurt, something would happen to me.

1242
00:53:22.450 --> 00:53:26.230
And that it was best if I just learned

1243
00:53:26.230 --> 00:53:31.230
how to crunch numbers and do accounting and balance books.

1244
00:53:32.890 --> 00:53:33.880
He didn't want me to leave.

1245
00:53:33.880 --> 00:53:38.490
He never wanted me to leave, because he was terrified

1246
00:53:39.480 --> 00:53:42.730
that fate was going to come knocking at his door.

1247
00:53:44.801 --> 00:53:48.150
And then, one day, I realized that I was building

1248
00:53:48.150 --> 00:53:52.130
my whole life around what someone else told him

1249
00:53:52.130 --> 00:53:53.930
his life was going to be,

1250
00:53:55.570 --> 00:53:58.590
and that it was in this fucking cycle

1251
00:53:58.590 --> 00:54:00.120
of everyone chasing a destiny.

1252
00:54:02.820 --> 00:54:05.010
And how fathers do love their sons.

1253
00:54:05.010 --> 00:54:06.500
Yes, they do.

1254
00:54:06.500 --> 00:54:09.020
Sounds like he was very protective of you.

1255
00:54:09.020 --> 00:54:09.853
He was.

1256
00:54:11.410 --> 00:54:12.620
I'd always felt selfish,

1257
00:54:14.300 --> 00:54:15.510
like if something happened to me,

1258
00:54:15.510 --> 00:54:18.100
his entire fucking dynasty

1259
00:54:18.100 --> 00:54:19.950
would come crumbling down around him.

1260
00:54:21.720 --> 00:54:23.910
Give me a picture of your family now,

1261
00:54:23.910 --> 00:54:25.740
they're very successful in this area.

1262
00:54:25.740 --> 00:54:28.290
Does that mean that you have lived on an estate?

1263
00:54:28.290 --> 00:54:29.210
Is there security?

1264
00:54:29.210 --> 00:54:30.760
Does your father have men?

1265
00:54:31.960 --> 00:54:35.240
Or is it as simple as walking up and knocking on the door?

1266
00:54:35.240 --> 00:54:40.240
Hmm, pretty big winery, big house, a few stories.

1267
00:54:42.460 --> 00:54:44.620
Very upper-class life that he built.

1268
00:54:46.280 --> 00:54:47.510
Does my dad have any men?

1269
00:54:47.510 --> 00:54:48.610
Do we have bodyguards?

1270
00:54:48.610 --> 00:54:50.000
Maybe a couple?

1271
00:54:50.000 --> 00:54:52.530
He'd probably have a couple of folks

1272
00:54:52.530 --> 00:54:55.180
that work to both just watch the premises

1273
00:54:55.180 --> 00:54:58.860
they lived at and to keep watch on storage

1274
00:54:58.860 --> 00:55:01.040
of their wines, suppose the process.

1275
00:55:01.040 --> 00:55:02.480
I relay the message.

1276
00:55:02.480 --> 00:55:05.350
Does he know how capable you are in battle, Beau?

1277
00:55:05.350 --> 00:55:07.860
Because you're one of the best fighters I've ever seen.

1278
00:55:10.458 --> 00:55:11.908
I don't know what he knows.

1279
00:55:13.370 --> 00:55:14.203
Hmm.

1280
00:55:18.320 --> 00:55:19.890
Him giving me away was the greatest thing

1281
00:55:19.890 --> 00:55:21.140
that ever happened to me.

1282
00:55:25.110 --> 00:55:26.900
It led me to all of you.

1283
00:55:26.900 --> 00:55:28.180
We should let him know that.

1284
00:55:30.127 --> 00:55:31.809
Let him see what got away.

1285
00:55:31.809 --> 00:55:34.910
(whimsical adventure music)

1286
00:55:34.910 --> 00:55:37.260
We have to speak to him.

1287
00:55:37.260 --> 00:55:38.950
Even if we don't go trudging into the mountains

1288
00:55:38.950 --> 00:55:40.850
or into the middle of the goblin camp,

1289
00:55:41.810 --> 00:55:42.800
we need to find out.

1290
00:55:42.800 --> 00:55:45.950
We have talked about it for, (sighing) ages.

1291
00:55:47.040 --> 00:55:48.410
Yeah, I know.

1292
00:55:48.410 --> 00:55:50.820
I know, yes, you're right.

1293
00:55:50.820 --> 00:55:54.450
You're right.
And we have the time now.

1294
00:55:54.450 --> 00:55:57.810
We can follow this trail as far as we want,

1295
00:55:57.810 --> 00:55:59.750
and Beau can lead.

1296
00:56:02.710 --> 00:56:07.300
Yes, and I suppose, even after we find this woman,

1297
00:56:09.940 --> 00:56:12.680
we don't have to do the thing right away, if--

1298
00:56:12.680 --> 00:56:15.890
Exactly.
If I'm not feeling it.

1299
00:56:15.890 --> 00:56:18.550
Right, we can--
It is an open offer.

1300
00:56:18.550 --> 00:56:21.530
We can go find a woman, we destroy her,

1301
00:56:21.530 --> 00:56:24.510
or we destroy the curse, whichever.

1302
00:56:24.510 --> 00:56:26.210
At least we take a step in that direction.

1303
00:56:26.210 --> 00:56:29.290
And then, you can be free to do whatever you want to.

1304
00:56:30.620 --> 00:56:33.260
If we destroy her or destroy her magic,

1305
00:56:34.610 --> 00:56:37.780
does that somehow mean that Beau's father

1306
00:56:37.780 --> 00:56:39.040
will lose everything?

1307
00:56:39.950 --> 00:56:41.080
And--
Hmm.

1308
00:56:41.080 --> 00:56:42.290
I don't think so.

1309
00:56:42.290 --> 00:56:43.123
Possible.

1310
00:56:44.270 --> 00:56:45.850
I don't think so, either.

1311
00:56:45.850 --> 00:56:49.120
Like he won't die or anything, right?

1312
00:56:50.221 --> 00:56:52.250
It won't be sort of like a Back to the Future situation?

1313
00:56:52.250 --> 00:56:53.320
Maybe it will protect him,

1314
00:56:53.320 --> 00:56:55.010
because whatever deal he made with her,

1315
00:56:55.010 --> 00:56:57.800
I'm sure she traded something pretty valuable for it.

1316
00:56:58.712 --> 00:56:59.830
I don't know if there's any way to know.

1317
00:56:59.830 --> 00:57:03.900
I threw the sword in the lava, and that was it.

1318
00:57:08.207 --> 00:57:09.310
I'm sure if we did--

1319
00:57:09.310 --> 00:57:10.410
You're Fjord, right?

1320
00:57:12.740 --> 00:57:14.270
That was it for Uk'otoa.

1321
00:57:16.140 --> 00:57:18.340
Sorry I dropped my staff again.

1322
00:57:18.340 --> 00:57:19.550
You going to stop doing that.

1323
00:57:19.550 --> 00:57:21.420
It's getting tinier and tinier each time.

1324
00:57:21.420 --> 00:57:23.398
It's splintering into pieces.

1325
00:57:23.398 --> 00:57:24.320
Let me get it for you--
Get a new one.

1326
00:57:24.320 --> 00:57:28.120
Thank you, thank you.
(sword whooshing)

1327
00:57:28.120 --> 00:57:31.078
It's nunchuks now, dope!
(laughter)

1328
00:57:31.078 --> 00:57:34.100
I don't know, I think if we did destroy this woman,

1329
00:57:35.120 --> 00:57:37.190
it would not undo time.

1330
00:57:37.190 --> 00:57:40.650
It would, maybe it would spoil the land, if that.

1331
00:57:43.440 --> 00:57:45.910
Well, it's evening now?

1332
00:57:47.020 --> 00:57:50.470
I don't know, it's, after all the work and preparing

1333
00:57:50.470 --> 00:57:52.920
for the ritual that you guys did, it's afternoon.

1334
00:57:54.500 --> 00:57:56.810
I mean, do we go now?
I say we go now.

1335
00:57:56.810 --> 00:57:57.643
Let's go.

1336
00:57:58.870 --> 00:58:00.260
If we're going through Zadash,

1337
00:58:00.260 --> 00:58:02.010
and we're going through the Cobalt Soul,

1338
00:58:02.010 --> 00:58:04.570
we can do a little bit of research first before we leave.

1339
00:58:04.570 --> 00:58:05.670
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

1340
00:58:05.670 --> 00:58:07.260
Sweet, sweet, sweet, sweet, sweet, sweet, sweet.

1341
00:58:07.260 --> 00:58:08.950
I say we go now, and then, get horses,

1342
00:58:08.950 --> 00:58:11.020
and leave in the morning from--

1343
00:58:11.020 --> 00:58:13.980
Yeah, we can always stay the night in my room.

1344
00:58:13.980 --> 00:58:15.810
Oh, yeah, all of us just pile in?

1345
00:58:15.810 --> 00:58:17.333
Yeah.

1346
00:58:17.333 --> 00:58:18.283
This is exciting.

1347
00:58:19.170 --> 00:58:20.710
Totally serious, but exciting.

1348
00:58:20.710 --> 00:58:23.250
Yeah, yeah, no, yeah, it's exciting, yeah.

1349
00:58:25.360 --> 00:58:26.430
Yep.

1350
00:58:26.430 --> 00:58:27.963
Doing it?

1351
00:58:27.963 --> 00:58:28.796
We're doing it?
Let's do it.

1352
00:58:28.796 --> 00:58:29.810
We're on our way.
All right.

1353
00:58:31.050 --> 00:58:33.700
All right, hang on, make sure everything's unplugged.

1354
00:58:34.891 --> 00:58:36.390
Just turn off the hot water heater.

1355
00:58:36.390 --> 00:58:37.290
Oven's off.

1356
00:58:37.290 --> 00:58:38.811
All right.

1357
00:58:38.811 --> 00:58:40.810
I'm going to go upstairs, check everything.

1358
00:58:40.810 --> 00:58:42.760
It looks like some fruit over here.

1359
00:58:42.760 --> 00:58:43.910
Should we just--
Just take it.

1360
00:58:43.910 --> 00:58:45.970
Just, no, put it in my bag, put it my bag.

1361
00:58:45.970 --> 00:58:47.710
Compost into the kitchen--

1362
00:58:47.710 --> 00:58:50.600
I mean, what are we going to do with 12 oranges?

1363
00:58:50.600 --> 00:58:51.870
Take them with us.
Really?

1364
00:58:51.870 --> 00:58:52.703
Yeah.
All right.

1365
00:58:52.703 --> 00:58:54.320
I will eat that shit.

1366
00:58:54.320 --> 00:58:56.320
Caleb goes to their shared laboratory,

1367
00:58:56.320 --> 00:58:59.940
and just does 90% of what is required to travel to Zadash.

1368
00:58:59.940 --> 00:59:01.280
All right.
Waits til everyone is ready.

1369
00:59:01.280 --> 00:59:04.540
Fair enough.
Drain the hot tub.

1370
00:59:04.540 --> 00:59:08.798
You drain your hot tub.
(laughter)

1371
00:59:08.798 --> 00:59:10.580
Oh, man, that's going to take forever to fill back up.

1372
00:59:11.847 --> 00:59:13.370
You don't want to come back to the green water.

1373
00:59:13.370 --> 00:59:14.820
It's terrible.
(Jester gagging)

1374
00:59:14.820 --> 00:59:17.237
That's for everyone.
Yeah.

1375
00:59:17.237 --> 00:59:19.137
Get syphilis from it.
All righty.

1376
00:59:20.590 --> 00:59:21.910
Is there anything specific that needs to prep

1377
00:59:21.910 --> 00:59:23.280
before you make your way

1378
00:59:23.280 --> 00:59:25.150
towards Caleb's Teleportation Circle?

1379
00:59:25.150 --> 00:59:26.630
You ready?
I feel pretty good.

1380
00:59:26.630 --> 00:59:28.170
No.
Here we go.

1381
00:59:28.170 --> 00:59:30.050
Do we need to prep anything?

1382
00:59:30.050 --> 00:59:32.400
The back of my neck gets really sweaty.

1383
00:59:32.400 --> 00:59:34.450
Psyche yourself up.
Ugh.

1384
00:59:34.450 --> 00:59:36.040
We don't need to tell Essek we're leaving,

1385
00:59:36.040 --> 00:59:36.980
we don't need to do anything.

1386
00:59:36.980 --> 00:59:38.430
No.
We're just going to go.

1387
00:59:38.430 --> 00:59:40.010
I'm going to Essek we're leaving.

1388
00:59:40.010 --> 00:59:41.210
Yeah, last thing I said to him

1389
00:59:41.210 --> 00:59:42.448
is that we would see him soon.

1390
00:59:42.448 --> 00:59:44.840
Okay, yeah, I'm going to send Essek a message.

1391
00:59:44.840 --> 00:59:46.270
All right.

1392
00:59:46.270 --> 00:59:49.460
Hey, Essek, we're going to find that evil laughing lady

1393
00:59:49.460 --> 00:59:52.910
so that means we'll be back, I don't know when.

1394
00:59:52.910 --> 00:59:55.410
We'll be at the negotiations, though, don't worry.

1395
00:59:57.030 --> 00:59:58.800
Practice was fun.

1396
00:59:58.800 --> 01:00:00.577
He got most of that.
Okay.

1397
01:00:00.577 --> 01:00:02.350
(Matt chuckling)
Forgot to capitalize--

1398
01:00:02.350 --> 01:00:04.610
Just this once.
(Jester laughing)

1399
01:00:04.610 --> 01:00:06.210
Very well.

1400
01:00:06.210 --> 01:00:08.110
I have my own business to attend to, as well.

1401
01:00:08.110 --> 01:00:12.100
So good luck, and I'm sure we'll cross paths

1402
01:00:12.100 --> 01:00:12.933
again very soon.

1403
01:00:14.220 --> 01:00:15.700
He says he loves you so much, Caleb.

1404
01:00:15.700 --> 01:00:19.040
What?
You did?

1405
01:00:19.040 --> 01:00:20.050
Yeah, he loves Caleb.

1406
01:00:20.050 --> 01:00:21.660
Yeah, I am such a, yeah.

1407
01:00:23.133 --> 01:00:26.130
(laughter)
That was great.

1408
01:00:27.320 --> 01:00:30.350
That is a 23.
Aw.

1409
01:00:30.350 --> 01:00:33.090
(laughter)

1410
01:00:33.090 --> 01:00:34.319
Make a deception check test.

1411
01:00:34.319 --> 01:00:36.210
(laughter)

1412
01:00:36.210 --> 01:00:37.095
Roll versus roll.

1413
01:00:37.095 --> 01:00:39.104
Yeah, boom!
No!

1414
01:00:39.104 --> 01:00:41.690
(laughter)
Seven.

1415
01:00:45.973 --> 01:00:47.740
All righty.

1416
01:00:47.740 --> 01:00:50.000
You've gathered your things from the Xhorhaus--

1417
01:00:50.000 --> 01:00:52.170
Fuck me.
You go and meet Caleb

1418
01:00:52.170 --> 01:00:55.340
in the laboratory as he completes the majority

1419
01:00:55.340 --> 01:00:57.810
of the teleportation circle with the central sigil

1420
01:00:57.810 --> 01:01:00.510
that leads you towards Zadash.

1421
01:01:00.510 --> 01:01:01.343
Zadash.

1422
01:01:03.720 --> 01:01:05.500
He finishes the final marking, and vroom,

1423
01:01:05.500 --> 01:01:07.590
you see it light up in the familiar sense.

1424
01:01:07.590 --> 01:01:09.030
The doorway is open.

1425
01:01:09.030 --> 01:01:10.651
You rush through, one after the other--

1426
01:01:10.651 --> 01:01:12.800
Were we supposed to point when we're coming?

1427
01:01:12.800 --> 01:01:15.717
(laughter)

1428
01:01:19.600 --> 01:01:20.433
Oh, shoot.

1429
01:01:21.400 --> 01:01:22.640
We are the worst.

1430
01:01:23.805 --> 01:01:26.168
Oh.
It's too much to track, man.

1431
01:01:26.168 --> 01:01:27.001
It's so much to track.

1432
01:01:27.001 --> 01:01:30.540
You return to the familiar underground teleportation nexus

1433
01:01:30.540 --> 01:01:33.200
of the Cobalt Soul where two of the guards,

1434
01:01:33.200 --> 01:01:34.670
and they spin around, (yelling).

1435
01:01:34.670 --> 01:01:38.270
I'm sorry, oh, I'm sorry.

1436
01:01:38.270 --> 01:01:41.350
I didn't meant to do the last marking on the floor.

1437
01:01:41.350 --> 01:01:43.420
I got a little overexcited--

1438
01:01:43.420 --> 01:01:45.860
It's all right, it's all right.

1439
01:01:45.860 --> 01:01:46.693
Forgetting the protocol.

1440
01:01:46.693 --> 01:01:47.830
It's my bad.

1441
01:01:47.830 --> 01:01:49.790
I, remember, I'm the one that does it.

1442
01:01:49.790 --> 01:01:50.740
I should've sent a message.

1443
01:01:50.740 --> 01:01:53.690
It was a Sunday, I wasn't thinking of people

1444
01:01:53.690 --> 01:01:55.170
being in on office hours.

1445
01:01:55.170 --> 01:01:57.830
What's Sunday?
What's a Sunday?

1446
01:01:57.830 --> 01:02:02.056
There's sun every day.
(laughter)

1447
01:02:02.056 --> 01:02:04.980
That's what's hitting their mind real hard.

1448
01:02:04.980 --> 01:02:07.252
Oh, that's fast.
(laughter)

1449
01:02:07.252 --> 01:02:08.740
There's the itch.
It itches.

1450
01:02:08.740 --> 01:02:11.550
Then you lose track of the days,

1451
01:02:11.550 --> 01:02:15.650
then your ears fall off.
(laughter)

1452
01:02:15.650 --> 01:02:17.854
You're the old crone, it's you.

1453
01:02:17.854 --> 01:02:21.130
(Beau laughing)

1454
01:02:21.130 --> 01:02:22.740
Let's reset some shit.
All right.

1455
01:02:22.740 --> 01:02:23.780
All right, so you have access

1456
01:02:23.780 --> 01:02:24.613
to a couple of tomes.

1457
01:02:24.613 --> 01:02:26.486
Anything you want to specifically try and research,

1458
01:02:26.486 --> 01:02:28.400
now is the time to do so.

1459
01:02:28.400 --> 01:02:30.640
Is there a book on old women?

1460
01:02:30.640 --> 01:02:33.790
Old hags in woods?
Who grant wishes?

1461
01:02:33.790 --> 01:02:35.510
Is there, there's going to be, right?

1462
01:02:35.510 --> 01:02:37.300
Like myths, and then, local myths?

1463
01:02:37.300 --> 01:02:38.133
Yeah, yeah.

1464
01:02:38.133 --> 01:02:39.800
Well, what is it your trying to research

1465
01:02:39.800 --> 01:02:41.250
I guess is more the question?

1466
01:02:43.200 --> 01:02:44.620
Worldly deal-makers.

1467
01:02:45.520 --> 01:02:47.540
Old ladies in woods.

1468
01:02:47.540 --> 01:02:50.030
Women that trade in fortune.
Okay.

1469
01:02:50.030 --> 01:02:52.120
The mysterious women who grant wishes

1470
01:02:52.120 --> 01:02:54.703
who live in the forest calendar of this year.

1471
01:02:54.703 --> 01:02:57.135
(laughter)

1472
01:02:57.135 --> 01:02:57.968
It's going to be a calendar.

1473
01:02:57.968 --> 01:03:00.170
There are no titles matching that search.

1474
01:03:00.170 --> 01:03:03.520
I found a calendar for men with plants this week,

1475
01:03:03.520 --> 01:03:06.610
I'm not kidding, it was just pictures of men with plants.

1476
01:03:06.610 --> 01:03:07.800
They've got a calendar for everything.

1477
01:03:07.800 --> 01:03:09.290
Don't google that.
So--

1478
01:03:09.290 --> 01:03:11.530
Oh boy.
(laughter)

1479
01:03:11.530 --> 01:03:12.880
The towel's not endorsed.

1480
01:03:13.720 --> 01:03:15.290
Who wants to research what?

1481
01:03:15.290 --> 01:03:16.510
What preparation are you doing?

1482
01:03:16.510 --> 01:03:18.280
Who's looking for what?

1483
01:03:18.280 --> 01:03:20.500
I'm going to hit local myths.

1484
01:03:20.500 --> 01:03:21.990
Local myths.

1485
01:03:21.990 --> 01:03:24.480
That sound like old hags in--

1486
01:03:24.480 --> 01:03:26.999
Yeah, fairy tales in Kamordah.

1487
01:03:26.999 --> 01:03:30.980
I will assist Beauregard.
I can do some research, too.

1488
01:03:30.980 --> 01:03:34.290
I'm going to do, any books

1489
01:03:34.290 --> 01:03:38.830
about goblin movements around,

1490
01:03:38.830 --> 01:03:40.170
goblin, goblin.
Okay.

1491
01:03:40.170 --> 01:03:41.350
Tracing patterns.

1492
01:03:41.350 --> 01:03:42.650
Go ahead and make, if you're assisting,

1493
01:03:42.650 --> 01:03:45.831
go ahead and make an investigation check with advantage.

1494
01:03:45.831 --> 01:03:49.720
(dice clattering)
♪ Yay for advantage. ♪

1495
01:03:49.720 --> 01:03:51.480
24.
24.

1496
01:03:51.480 --> 01:03:53.200
Oh, 23, 23.
23.

1497
01:03:53.200 --> 01:03:54.350
Still pretty dang good.

1498
01:03:56.150 --> 01:03:58.090
That's actually really good, okay.

1499
01:04:00.850 --> 01:04:05.330
So what you end up finding is a record of

1500
01:04:07.620 --> 01:04:12.620
somewhat, I'd say known, but at least spoken about

1501
01:04:13.190 --> 01:04:16.340
soothsayers and hermits that fits similar

1502
01:04:16.340 --> 01:04:18.260
to the realm of what you're looking for,

1503
01:04:20.460 --> 01:04:22.130
within the region of the Marrow Valley.

1504
01:04:22.130 --> 01:04:23.890
There's a number of them, and some that are up north.

1505
01:04:23.890 --> 01:04:26.360
There are some that, you know,

1506
01:04:26.360 --> 01:04:28.680
wander through the Cyrios Mountains.

1507
01:04:28.680 --> 01:04:29.930
On the Menagerie Coast side,

1508
01:04:29.930 --> 01:04:33.330
there's talk of one hermit that lives

1509
01:04:33.330 --> 01:04:36.440
way, way out in the Menagerie Coast,

1510
01:04:36.440 --> 01:04:41.440
this female protector of the island creatures.

1511
01:04:42.840 --> 01:04:44.350
All of these are unique stories and stuff.

1512
01:04:44.350 --> 01:04:46.340
There's one that you, there's two that you find

1513
01:04:46.340 --> 01:04:48.890
that are local to the area you're looking

1514
01:04:48.890 --> 01:04:50.640
in the Marrow Valley.

1515
01:04:50.640 --> 01:04:54.760
One is Isharnai, the Prism Sage.

1516
01:04:54.760 --> 01:04:58.610
Ashani--
Isharnai, the Prism Sage.

1517
01:04:58.610 --> 01:05:00.840
Do I dare ask you to spell that?

1518
01:05:00.840 --> 01:05:04.350
I-S-H-A-R-N-A-I.
Isharnai.

1519
01:05:05.640 --> 01:05:07.090
The Prison Sage?
The Prism?

1520
01:05:07.090 --> 01:05:08.200
The Prism Sage.

1521
01:05:10.050 --> 01:05:12.970
A woman who lives alone among the Cyrios Mountain Woods,

1522
01:05:12.970 --> 01:05:14.600
north of the Bromkiln Hills.

1523
01:05:14.600 --> 01:05:17.500
She wields strange magics, weaving boons and hexes

1524
01:05:17.500 --> 01:05:19.640
for those who make the journey to find her.

1525
01:05:19.640 --> 01:05:21.000
Many high prices for her deeds,

1526
01:05:21.000 --> 01:05:22.350
sometimes beyond mere coin.

1527
01:05:23.250 --> 01:05:25.350
You also find Old Masqier.

1528
01:05:26.250 --> 01:05:28.920
Old?
Old Masqier.

1529
01:05:28.920 --> 01:05:32.094
Mask?
M-A-S-Q-I-E-R.

1530
01:05:32.094 --> 01:05:33.230
Mm, okay.
Oh.

1531
01:05:33.230 --> 01:05:34.685
Yeah, that's a better spelling.

1532
01:05:34.685 --> 01:05:39.685
Old Masqier is a gnarled gnome of terse temperament,

1533
01:05:39.850 --> 01:05:42.740
who migrates through the Cyrengreen Forest.

1534
01:05:42.740 --> 01:05:45.060
Learned to take sides with the forest over civilization,

1535
01:05:45.060 --> 01:05:47.230
he has both been a healer and an adversary to some

1536
01:05:47.230 --> 01:05:49.010
over the decades, depending on the disposition

1537
01:05:49.010 --> 01:05:50.160
when encountering them.

1538
01:05:51.500 --> 01:05:53.520
That's a man--
That's a gnome?

1539
01:05:53.520 --> 01:05:54.890
A gnomish man?
Yes.

1540
01:05:54.890 --> 01:05:56.280
A wandering--
That sounds like

1541
01:05:56.280 --> 01:05:58.150
not the right one.
What was his name?

1542
01:05:58.150 --> 01:05:59.280
Old--
Old Masqier.

1543
01:05:59.280 --> 01:06:01.080
Old Masqier.
Masqier.

1544
01:06:01.080 --> 01:06:03.280
The Cyrengreen Forest, is that what you said?

1545
01:06:03.280 --> 01:06:04.738
Correct.
It all makes sense.

1546
01:06:04.738 --> 01:06:07.200
Where is that?

1547
01:06:07.200 --> 01:06:09.860
The Cyrengreen Forest is here.

1548
01:06:09.860 --> 01:06:10.980
Okay.

1549
01:06:10.980 --> 01:06:13.300
Okay.
And the other is north

1550
01:06:13.300 --> 01:06:17.290
of Bromkiln Hills.
North of the Bromkiln Hills.

1551
01:06:17.290 --> 01:06:19.540
I'm excited by both these options.

1552
01:06:19.540 --> 01:06:21.230
What with Old Masqier?

1553
01:06:22.840 --> 01:06:24.650
It's going to be Isharnai.

1554
01:06:24.650 --> 01:06:27.000
Is that it, or are those the--

1555
01:06:27.000 --> 01:06:29.890
Those are the two that find that match

1556
01:06:29.890 --> 01:06:32.190
what you're looking for loosely,

1557
01:06:32.190 --> 01:06:36.820
as far as hermited sages and you know,

1558
01:06:36.820 --> 01:06:39.550
soothsayers, people that deal in the sorta stuff

1559
01:06:39.550 --> 01:06:41.730
that you're looking for in the region.

1560
01:06:45.600 --> 01:06:47.870
Any other detail on Isharnai?

1561
01:06:49.130 --> 01:06:50.100
Is she old?

1562
01:06:50.100 --> 01:06:55.100
Does it say how long these stories go back, anything?

1563
01:06:55.330 --> 01:06:58.110
The stories go back about 50 or so years.

1564
01:07:00.717 --> 01:07:01.610
That doesn't feel right.

1565
01:07:01.610 --> 01:07:05.260
And they're just, you know,

1566
01:07:05.260 --> 01:07:08.440
loose mutterings of people who had encounters

1567
01:07:08.440 --> 01:07:09.340
with both of them.

1568
01:07:10.280 --> 01:07:11.860
Here's another stack, try these.

1569
01:07:11.860 --> 01:07:12.693
Mm, okay.

1570
01:07:16.740 --> 01:07:17.660
All right.

1571
01:07:17.660 --> 01:07:19.430
This one, that's my roll.

1572
01:07:19.430 --> 01:07:21.297
Okay, pretty good.
Right?

1573
01:07:21.297 --> 01:07:22.130
Yeah.

1574
01:07:22.130 --> 01:07:24.440
Hey, maybe I can try scrying with Isharnai.

1575
01:07:27.060 --> 01:07:28.810
Describe what she looks like again.

1576
01:07:29.690 --> 01:07:34.330
Well, she's a human, so sort of like Beau,

1577
01:07:34.330 --> 01:07:37.110
except way older.
Okay.

1578
01:07:37.110 --> 01:07:40.870
And not strong like Beau?

1579
01:07:41.760 --> 01:07:46.031
And also, with a hood, and also,

1580
01:07:46.031 --> 01:07:48.830
not looking anything like Beauregard in any way.

1581
01:07:48.830 --> 01:07:51.150
So just basically human.

1582
01:07:51.150 --> 01:07:52.350
Like a human.

1583
01:07:52.350 --> 01:07:54.960
Like an old ass human.
Yeah, yeah,

1584
01:07:54.960 --> 01:07:57.840
like saggy jowls, and--
Are you sure

1585
01:07:57.840 --> 01:07:59.540
it was a human and not like a half-elf?

1586
01:07:59.540 --> 01:08:00.980
You know what, I'm really not, no.

1587
01:08:00.980 --> 01:08:04.210
Humanoid, old ass humanoid.

1588
01:08:04.210 --> 01:08:06.890
Old ass humanoid.
In robes.

1589
01:08:06.890 --> 01:08:08.510
Yeah, that day.
Okay.

1590
01:08:10.130 --> 01:08:14.150
And she said, "Debt paid," and her voice sounded

1591
01:08:14.150 --> 01:08:16.270
like this, "A debt paid."

1592
01:08:16.270 --> 01:08:18.000
It sounded like you.

1593
01:08:18.000 --> 01:08:19.430
Yeah.
Okay.

1594
01:08:19.430 --> 01:08:22.080
Well, if you want, roll an intelligence check for me.

1595
01:08:23.660 --> 01:08:25.270
Just a straight intelligence?

1596
01:08:25.270 --> 01:08:26.380
13.
13.

1597
01:08:26.380 --> 01:08:27.970
Okay, you have a fairly decent recollection

1598
01:08:27.970 --> 01:08:28.850
of what she looks like

1599
01:08:28.850 --> 01:08:30.330
from the brief moment you encountered.

1600
01:08:30.330 --> 01:08:32.330
You actually have a pretty good mental image.

1601
01:08:32.330 --> 01:08:34.570
Can you make yourself look like her?

1602
01:08:34.570 --> 01:08:35.403
I can try.

1603
01:08:36.350 --> 01:08:39.360
I will cast whatever that is.

1604
01:08:39.360 --> 01:08:40.193
Disguise Self?

1605
01:08:40.193 --> 01:08:41.380
Disguise Self, thank you.

1606
01:08:41.380 --> 01:08:43.510
And do my best.

1607
01:08:43.510 --> 01:08:45.570
There's some blurry bits.
Okay.

1608
01:08:45.570 --> 01:08:48.530
Yeah, there's no hood beyond the one that Nott has,

1609
01:08:48.530 --> 01:08:50.300
so there's no clothing element to it,

1610
01:08:50.300 --> 01:08:52.150
but from the face that you can see,

1611
01:08:52.150 --> 01:08:54.840
you see what appears to be a humanoid woman,

1612
01:08:54.840 --> 01:08:56.380
elongated features,

1613
01:08:59.950 --> 01:09:01.920
very high cheekbones that ride

1614
01:09:01.920 --> 01:09:04.120
the side of the face back far,

1615
01:09:05.200 --> 01:09:07.620
jowls that seem very deep, but then hang below,

1616
01:09:07.620 --> 01:09:10.560
almost like a droopy dog type--

1617
01:09:10.560 --> 01:09:11.990
Ugh.
Aesthetic.

1618
01:09:11.990 --> 01:09:14.550
Droopy dog.
But far less adorable.

1619
01:09:14.550 --> 01:09:19.228
But we see it.
(laughter)

1620
01:09:19.228 --> 01:09:21.170
And these dull, green eyes.

1621
01:09:21.170 --> 01:09:22.560
Does she look human to me,

1622
01:09:22.560 --> 01:09:24.760
or does she look like otherworldly to me?

1623
01:09:26.150 --> 01:09:28.130
It rides a line.
Okay.

1624
01:09:28.130 --> 01:09:29.610
And because I didn't see her hair--

1625
01:09:29.610 --> 01:09:30.443
It's pretty stretched.

1626
01:09:30.443 --> 01:09:31.910
I could just make of it a hook,

1627
01:09:31.910 --> 01:09:34.160
and because I didn't see her body very much,

1628
01:09:34.160 --> 01:09:37.156
I'm just going to make it look like three co. bolts.

1629
01:09:37.156 --> 01:09:39.387
(laughter)

1630
01:09:39.387 --> 01:09:42.930
I'm going to focus on the face.
(laughter)

1631
01:09:44.155 --> 01:09:46.230
But it is quite a sight for the rest of them.

1632
01:09:46.230 --> 01:09:47.560
Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay.

1633
01:09:47.560 --> 01:09:50.330
I'm going to try and scry on her.

1634
01:09:50.330 --> 01:09:52.360
Okay, so you're saying you're going to attempt a scry.

1635
01:09:52.360 --> 01:09:54.150
Yeah, in the library.
Okay.

1636
01:09:55.080 --> 01:09:58.170
As you're sketching it up, one of the monks is like,

1637
01:09:58.170 --> 01:10:00.090
"I'm sorry, miss?"
Huh?

1638
01:10:01.320 --> 01:10:02.220
They're with me.

1639
01:10:03.200 --> 01:10:04.930
One.
I'm, huh, what?

1640
01:10:04.930 --> 01:10:05.770
Nothing, continue.

1641
01:10:05.770 --> 01:10:07.945
And they shuffle (laughs)

1642
01:10:07.945 --> 01:10:08.778
That's awesome.

1643
01:10:11.404 --> 01:10:13.970
You finish the spell, you close your eyes,

1644
01:10:15.630 --> 01:10:17.900
leech your consciousness out to the Traveler,

1645
01:10:17.900 --> 01:10:19.610
to take you where it needs to be.

1646
01:10:26.076 --> 01:10:28.207
Hello.
Here it is.

1647
01:10:28.207 --> 01:10:29.040
Uh-oh.

1648
01:10:29.895 --> 01:10:30.797
Uh-oh.

1649
01:10:30.797 --> 01:10:32.260
Some betting over there.

1650
01:10:32.260 --> 01:10:36.670
The Traveler, you see the sleeves emerge

1651
01:10:36.670 --> 01:10:40.420
from the ether around you, the imagery of the arms

1652
01:10:41.260 --> 01:10:45.180
touching and framing yours like a papa bear

1653
01:10:45.180 --> 01:10:46.013
over the cub.

1654
01:10:46.013 --> 01:10:47.360
Kind of like matching, like teeth?

1655
01:10:47.360 --> 01:10:48.410
A little bit, yeah.

1656
01:10:49.855 --> 01:10:51.420
And as you do, you feel your consciousness

1657
01:10:51.420 --> 01:10:52.920
drift out of the library,

1658
01:10:52.920 --> 01:10:55.310
brought up into the clouds once more,

1659
01:10:55.310 --> 01:10:59.690
rushed through the darkened, rain-bearing sky,

1660
01:10:59.690 --> 01:11:02.180
until eventually you're brought down rapidly

1661
01:11:02.180 --> 01:11:05.740
through fog, and through mists into the treetops.

1662
01:11:05.740 --> 01:11:07.460
You come through brambled forests,

1663
01:11:07.460 --> 01:11:09.640
and dark, dangerous wood,

1664
01:11:09.640 --> 01:11:11.570
and rocky, mountainside cliffs

1665
01:11:11.570 --> 01:11:15.000
before you come to rest where it seems like the interior

1666
01:11:15.000 --> 01:11:17.660
of some sort of a house.

1667
01:11:17.660 --> 01:11:21.530
Small, dense, cluttered, organized, in a way.

1668
01:11:21.530 --> 01:11:22.630
Everything has its place,

1669
01:11:22.630 --> 01:11:24.700
but it is very, very jam packed,

1670
01:11:24.700 --> 01:11:27.080
filled, and you see that the radius,

1671
01:11:27.080 --> 01:11:31.050
what looks like the outline of many collected books,

1672
01:11:31.050 --> 01:11:34.960
papers, broken lanterns and pieces,

1673
01:11:35.860 --> 01:11:38.430
elements of animal bone.

1674
01:11:38.430 --> 01:11:41.020
You can see what looks to be a large collection

1675
01:11:41.020 --> 01:11:44.120
of jars and vials of things that you can't quite make out

1676
01:11:44.120 --> 01:11:45.570
the details of what's inside.

1677
01:11:47.430 --> 01:11:49.800
You see just in the corner,

1678
01:11:51.120 --> 01:11:56.120
what looks to be a collection of stones

1679
01:11:56.310 --> 01:11:58.610
that are arranged in a pattern,

1680
01:11:58.610 --> 01:12:00.590
and then, in the center of the chamber,

1681
01:12:00.590 --> 01:12:05.590
you see a woman wrapped in heavy tattered robes

1682
01:12:06.780 --> 01:12:10.200
with these long elements of gold trim rope

1683
01:12:10.200 --> 01:12:12.290
wrapped around shoulder to side shoulder

1684
01:12:12.290 --> 01:12:15.890
to side, holding it on in a very unique

1685
01:12:15.890 --> 01:12:17.520
sort of ready to travel pattern.

1686
01:12:19.650 --> 01:12:23.550
You see the familiar face of her, currently looking down,

1687
01:12:23.550 --> 01:12:25.770
and grasped some of these arranged runes

1688
01:12:25.770 --> 01:12:28.290
in the side.
Are her arms long?

1689
01:12:28.290 --> 01:12:29.510
Her arms are long.
Yeah.

1690
01:12:29.510 --> 01:12:31.650
The fingers extending outward,

1691
01:12:31.650 --> 01:12:33.750
reminding you of Keona the Keen,

1692
01:12:33.750 --> 01:12:36.160
but with a physicality that matches.

1693
01:12:36.160 --> 01:12:36.993
Ooh.

1694
01:12:36.993 --> 01:12:37.930
What is she?

1695
01:12:37.930 --> 01:12:41.640
The movement seems, while you were debating

1696
01:12:41.640 --> 01:12:44.610
the human aspect of her with the visual element

1697
01:12:44.610 --> 01:12:48.460
of the illusion, the physicality of her definitely

1698
01:12:48.460 --> 01:12:52.030
scatters any idea of your standard human soothsayer.

1699
01:12:53.850 --> 01:12:57.010
Unable to really gauge size, it's hard to tell,

1700
01:12:57.010 --> 01:13:02.010
but the movements themselves are sweeping unnatural grace

1701
01:13:03.690 --> 01:13:06.370
to rapid grasps, and then, snatching,

1702
01:13:06.370 --> 01:13:09.590
as she takes some of these arranged runes

1703
01:13:09.590 --> 01:13:11.520
and you can see, to the ground in front of her,

1704
01:13:11.520 --> 01:13:14.330
there are these unique sketches with,

1705
01:13:14.330 --> 01:13:16.430
it looks almost like charcoal of some kind,

1706
01:13:16.430 --> 01:13:17.670
like you have these small circles.

1707
01:13:17.670 --> 01:13:19.610
She takes the runes and scatters them onto the ground.

1708
01:13:19.610 --> 01:13:22.320
As they all scatter and then arrange,

1709
01:13:22.320 --> 01:13:25.490
almost like there are magnets holding them to place.

1710
01:13:25.490 --> 01:13:27.220
Do the runes look familiar to me at all?

1711
01:13:27.220 --> 01:13:28.740
They're just outside of the range to make

1712
01:13:28.740 --> 01:13:30.620
any detail, but you can see them hitting

1713
01:13:30.620 --> 01:13:32.370
and scattering into place.
Okay.

1714
01:13:32.370 --> 01:13:35.980
At which point, her eyes go.
(Jester gasping)

1715
01:13:37.039 --> 01:13:38.890
Hello.
Oh, shit.

1716
01:13:42.710 --> 01:13:44.900
Who is this I see?

1717
01:13:47.220 --> 01:13:51.060
Um, Fiona Fancypants.
(laughter)

1718
01:13:51.060 --> 01:13:52.110
You can't converse through it.

1719
01:13:52.110 --> 01:13:53.330
Oh no.

1720
01:13:53.330 --> 01:13:56.770
But she just slowly stands up,

1721
01:13:56.770 --> 01:14:01.770
very aware of the scrying, arcane bobble

1722
01:14:01.860 --> 01:14:04.880
that you've sent there, and just puts the arms

1723
01:14:04.880 --> 01:14:06.240
almost like wrapping around it,

1724
01:14:06.240 --> 01:14:10.330
and just moves like, (groaning).

1725
01:14:10.330 --> 01:14:12.780
Oh, my curiosity is piqued.

1726
01:14:15.087 --> 01:14:18.217
I hope this means I'm having visitors,

1727
01:14:18.217 --> 01:14:19.137
(Matt clapping)
(gasping)

1728
01:14:19.137 --> 01:14:21.110
and it slams out.
(Jester yelling)

1729
01:14:21.110 --> 01:14:22.090
Are you okay?

1730
01:14:22.090 --> 01:14:23.269
What happened?
Oh my God.

1731
01:14:23.269 --> 01:14:26.280
She's so scary, she's so scary.

1732
01:14:27.127 --> 01:14:30.150
She knew I was there, she knew I was scrying on her.

1733
01:14:30.150 --> 01:14:31.800
Oh my God.
Did she threaten you?

1734
01:14:31.800 --> 01:14:32.850
Did she see you?

1735
01:14:32.850 --> 01:14:34.820
Did she know who you are?

1736
01:14:34.820 --> 01:14:35.740
I don't know.

1737
01:14:35.740 --> 01:14:37.460
I don't know if she saw me, I don't know if she saw

1738
01:14:37.460 --> 01:14:39.190
who I was, I don't know, I don't know.

1739
01:14:39.190 --> 01:14:41.150
She just said that she thought she was going

1740
01:14:41.150 --> 01:14:45.170
to have company, because she saw that I was looking at her.

1741
01:14:45.170 --> 01:14:47.500
She had really long hands and long arms,

1742
01:14:47.500 --> 01:14:48.910
and she's scary as fuck.

1743
01:14:48.910 --> 01:14:50.940
There goes the element of surprise.

1744
01:14:51.920 --> 01:14:52.780
Oh my God.

1745
01:14:54.325 --> 01:14:56.070
Oh my God.
She must be very magical.

1746
01:14:56.070 --> 01:14:58.330
Her face was so close to my scrying eye.

1747
01:14:59.290 --> 01:15:00.667
It was so close.

1748
01:15:00.667 --> 01:15:05.360
(laughs) Did you see up her nose?

1749
01:15:05.360 --> 01:15:08.380
I mean, I saw hair coming out of it,

1750
01:15:08.380 --> 01:15:10.900
I saw a booger hanging on the side of her nose.

1751
01:15:10.900 --> 01:15:11.780
That's how close she was.

1752
01:15:11.780 --> 01:15:13.240
Did she say anything?

1753
01:15:13.240 --> 01:15:16.880
She said, "What is this curiosity?"

1754
01:15:16.880 --> 01:15:19.520
See, I told you she sounded like that.

1755
01:15:19.520 --> 01:15:21.970
Well, she sounded, too--

1756
01:15:21.970 --> 01:15:23.710
Did she, can you disguise yourself

1757
01:15:23.710 --> 01:15:25.030
and make you look like her?

1758
01:15:25.030 --> 01:15:27.230
Oh my God, I cast Disguise Self,

1759
01:15:27.230 --> 01:15:30.320
and I do it so everyone can see how scary she was.

1760
01:15:30.320 --> 01:15:31.153
Ooh, ah.
Ugh.

1761
01:15:32.501 --> 01:15:33.770
And then she was like that.

1762
01:15:33.770 --> 01:15:34.603
Ugh, with the fingers?

1763
01:15:34.603 --> 01:15:36.260
And then, suddenly go like this,

1764
01:15:36.260 --> 01:15:38.510
and then like--
What is that?

1765
01:15:38.510 --> 01:15:40.870
You can see the gnarled clumps of hair

1766
01:15:40.870 --> 01:15:43.710
that drift out of the sides of the robe themselves,

1767
01:15:43.710 --> 01:15:45.920
tangled and knotted into these large,

1768
01:15:45.920 --> 01:15:48.330
gather rats' nests.

1769
01:15:48.330 --> 01:15:50.680
I walk up and start dancing next to Fjord.

1770
01:15:53.109 --> 01:15:56.280
(Jester hissing)
Please no.

1771
01:15:56.280 --> 01:15:59.170
There are now four members of the Cobalt Soul Library

1772
01:15:59.170 --> 01:16:00.920
that are about 25 feet away, going.

1773
01:16:03.910 --> 01:16:04.743
It's all right.

1774
01:16:04.743 --> 01:16:06.470
A few others are coming to join.

1775
01:16:06.470 --> 01:16:07.880
We are the Mighty Nein.

1776
01:16:07.880 --> 01:16:10.530
Beauregard, should we get bottle service over here?

1777
01:16:10.530 --> 01:16:11.460
What's wrong with you?

1778
01:16:11.460 --> 01:16:13.850
Are you okay?
I'm okay.

1779
01:16:13.850 --> 01:16:16.350
Does that ring any bells, that visage?

1780
01:16:16.350 --> 01:16:17.910
Wait, have you seen this person?

1781
01:16:17.910 --> 01:16:19.410
No.
Okay.

1782
01:16:20.794 --> 01:16:23.200
Does this look like, this looks like the woman, yeah?

1783
01:16:23.200 --> 01:16:24.370
Am I traumatizing you, Nott,

1784
01:16:24.370 --> 01:16:26.110
or do you want me to drop it?

1785
01:16:26.110 --> 01:16:28.390
No, I mean, I just looked like her a second ago.

1786
01:16:28.390 --> 01:16:29.350
That's true.
So it's fine.

1787
01:16:29.350 --> 01:16:31.210
But then you can't see that part, you know what I mean?

1788
01:16:31.210 --> 01:16:32.745
That's true.
Are you all right?

1789
01:16:32.745 --> 01:16:33.790
No, it's fine.

1790
01:16:33.790 --> 01:16:35.650
You do look super creepy, though.

1791
01:16:35.650 --> 01:16:38.530
Wait, you said she was laughing at you, or?

1792
01:16:38.530 --> 01:16:41.050
She was laughing, yes, and--

1793
01:16:41.050 --> 01:16:42.010
I dropped it. (laughs)

1794
01:16:42.010 --> 01:16:45.270
She seemed delighted that whatever she did to me worked

1795
01:16:47.282 --> 01:16:49.990
and that she'd created something horrifying.

1796
01:16:51.110 --> 01:16:51.943
You said you were hoping--

1797
01:16:51.943 --> 01:16:54.360
Why, do you know something about her, as well?

1798
01:16:54.360 --> 01:16:55.193
No.
Oh, okay.

1799
01:16:55.193 --> 01:16:56.026
I was just going to say if maybe--

1800
01:16:56.026 --> 01:16:57.660
Because everyone seems to be connected all of a sudden.

1801
01:16:57.660 --> 01:16:58.730
Oh, man, she's really smart.

1802
01:16:58.730 --> 01:17:00.760
What if she connects the dots that it's you,

1803
01:17:00.760 --> 01:17:03.240
that it's something about you that was scrying on her,

1804
01:17:03.240 --> 01:17:04.970
because you know, she just laughed--

1805
01:17:04.970 --> 01:17:05.803
How would she do that?
At you--

1806
01:17:05.803 --> 01:17:06.810
What?
Because she just laughed

1807
01:17:06.810 --> 01:17:07.830
in your head, you know?

1808
01:17:07.830 --> 01:17:09.940
But that could've been from ages ago.

1809
01:17:11.250 --> 01:17:12.083
That's true.

1810
01:17:12.083 --> 01:17:13.680
But maybe she gets senses when it happens,

1811
01:17:13.680 --> 01:17:14.790
because she's really powerful.

1812
01:17:14.790 --> 01:17:16.290
Let's go get some drinks.

1813
01:17:17.370 --> 01:17:19.560
Oh, that's not a bad idea.

1814
01:17:19.560 --> 01:17:21.920
Are we done looking up everything?

1815
01:17:21.920 --> 01:17:23.380
I think so.

1816
01:17:23.380 --> 01:17:24.390
Let's go.

1817
01:17:24.390 --> 01:17:26.260
I have checked out all of the information

1818
01:17:26.260 --> 01:17:27.093
on where to find this.

1819
01:17:27.093 --> 01:17:27.926
I draw.

1820
01:17:29.380 --> 01:17:31.200
Okay, yeah, it's,

1821
01:17:31.200 --> 01:17:33.850
Cyrios Mountain Woods, north of the Bromkiln Hills.

1822
01:17:33.850 --> 01:17:35.450
Some Kama Sutra--

1823
01:17:35.450 --> 01:17:37.290
Maybe in the Cobalt Soul books, those are really--

1824
01:17:37.290 --> 01:17:39.170
Roughly.
Okay, goodbye.

1825
01:17:39.170 --> 01:17:41.040
Yeah.
It's scattered.

1826
01:17:42.130 --> 01:17:43.770
She drew something in some books.

1827
01:17:43.770 --> 01:17:44.603
Mm.

1828
01:17:45.596 --> 01:17:47.303
Need a sleight of hand check.

1829
01:17:47.303 --> 01:17:48.378
Give me guidance--
Really?

1830
01:17:48.378 --> 01:17:49.800
Guide me.
Not for this.

1831
01:17:49.800 --> 01:17:50.886
I'm going to die--
Guidance.

1832
01:17:50.886 --> 01:17:53.803
(laughter)

1833
01:17:55.754 --> 01:17:57.310
♪ Sleight of hand ♪

1834

1835
01:18:01.190 --> 01:18:02.290
Oh, wait, I got a D4, too.

1836
01:18:02.290 --> 01:18:04.150
Hold on, hold on, I guided myself.

1837
01:18:05.466 --> 01:18:06.730
I'll remind you to guide it,

1838
01:18:06.730 --> 01:18:07.700
but I'm not going to guide it for you.

1839
01:18:07.700 --> 01:18:09.270
Ah, 20.
20, okay.

1840
01:18:10.970 --> 01:18:14.170
You proceed to leave a series--

(Matt laughing)

1842
01:18:19.673 --> 01:18:22.010
Call back.
And as tightly watched

1843
01:18:22.010 --> 01:18:23.980
as you are, Beau's presence leaves them

1844
01:18:23.980 --> 01:18:25.500
a little more comfortable about the fact

1845
01:18:25.500 --> 01:18:28.000
that you're not having to look over your shoulder

1846
01:18:28.000 --> 01:18:29.488
for the research you're doing.

1847
01:18:29.488 --> 01:18:31.690
You manage to leave a few of these sketches

1848
01:18:31.690 --> 01:18:33.170
within the books you find, and put them away

1849
01:18:33.170 --> 01:18:34.500
without being called on it.

1850
01:18:34.500 --> 01:18:36.060
You're uncertain if you've been noticed,

1851
01:18:36.060 --> 01:18:37.530
but you certainly weren't called out

1852
01:18:37.530 --> 01:18:40.720
or publicly punished for it.

1853
01:18:40.720 --> 01:18:41.553
Nice.

1854
01:18:42.630 --> 01:18:43.950
We're going to go get a drink.

1855
01:18:43.950 --> 01:18:45.650
Are we staying in Beau's house tonight?

1856
01:18:45.650 --> 01:18:49.220
Or are we going to stay at Dad's place?

1857
01:18:49.220 --> 01:18:50.730
Dad's is a bit of a ways off.

1858
01:18:50.730 --> 01:18:52.420
Yeah, we're in Zadash.

1859
01:18:52.420 --> 01:18:53.730
We probably need to find a place to stay

1860
01:18:53.730 --> 01:18:55.390
for the evening, and set off in the morning.

1861
01:18:55.390 --> 01:18:56.850
Yeah.
Beau's house was the plan.

1862
01:18:56.850 --> 01:18:59.030
Beau's house is--
I mean, Beau's place.

1863
01:18:59.030 --> 01:19:00.710
They're talking about The Gentleman.

1864
01:19:00.710 --> 01:19:03.260
The Gentleman, my mama, my dad.

1865
01:19:03.260 --> 01:19:05.110
Yeah, the Evening Nips, The Gentleman.

1866
01:19:05.110 --> 01:19:07.290
We've got a room there, too, you know?

1867
01:19:07.290 --> 01:19:08.450
Wherever we want to go.

1868
01:19:08.450 --> 01:19:11.590
Maybe we see where we'll end up after we drink.

1869
01:19:11.590 --> 01:19:12.900
But Beau's room is nicer.

1870
01:19:15.648 --> 01:19:19.910
But Gentleman's House is your dad, right?

1871
01:19:19.910 --> 01:19:20.840
Yup.

1872
01:19:20.840 --> 01:19:21.860
Dad seems the theme--

1873
01:19:21.860 --> 01:19:23.360
Of the day.
This is my dad.

1874
01:19:25.060 --> 01:19:27.670
Should we go get drinks at the Leaky Nip and then--

1875
01:19:27.670 --> 01:19:30.470
(laughs) It's the Evening Nip.

1876
01:19:30.470 --> 01:19:32.000
And then see if--

1877
01:19:32.980 --> 01:19:34.120
Have you told us that before?

1878
01:19:34.120 --> 01:19:35.294
What?

1879
01:19:35.294 --> 01:19:36.390
Have you told us that dad bit?

1880
01:19:36.390 --> 01:19:37.230
How are you--
I mean,

1881
01:19:37.230 --> 01:19:38.890
we suspected it, right?

1882
01:19:38.890 --> 01:19:40.850
Do we have confirmation?

1883
01:19:40.850 --> 01:19:41.840
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1884
01:19:41.840 --> 01:19:44.030
I mean, I'm assuming that I told you.

1885
01:19:44.030 --> 01:19:45.350
Okay, yeah.

1886
01:19:45.350 --> 01:19:46.530
We're roommates, so I'd say all.

1887
01:19:46.530 --> 01:19:48.310
Yeah.
This is Jester and Marisha.

1888
01:19:48.310 --> 01:19:50.530
Yeah.
(laughter)

1889
01:19:50.530 --> 01:19:52.960
But yeah, you guys, he totally, definitely told me,

1890
01:19:52.960 --> 01:19:54.690
he's definitely, totally my dad.

1891
01:19:56.140 --> 01:19:59.140
Yasha, my dad is The Gentleman.

1892
01:19:59.140 --> 01:20:02.310
The, the--
The blue guy?

1893
01:20:02.310 --> 01:20:03.980
Really moist and blue?

1894
01:20:03.980 --> 01:20:06.430
The moist guy?
He's, yeah, it's, yeah.

1895
01:20:06.430 --> 01:20:07.550
Tall drink of water.

1896
01:20:07.550 --> 01:20:09.490
Who has all of our blood on file.

1897
01:20:09.490 --> 01:20:11.760
Yeah, but now we know he's going to be cool about it,

1898
01:20:11.760 --> 01:20:12.593
because he's my dad.

1899
01:20:12.593 --> 01:20:14.790
He's not going to do anything fucked up, you know?

1900
01:20:14.790 --> 01:20:15.749
That's really cool.

1901
01:20:15.749 --> 01:20:16.582
Mm.

1902
01:20:16.582 --> 01:20:18.350
He seemed really cool.
Uh.

1903
01:20:18.350 --> 01:20:19.183
He is.

1904
01:20:20.100 --> 01:20:22.790
I really, I liked him, I feel weird

1905
01:20:22.790 --> 01:20:27.110
that he has some of my blood, but I really like him.

1906
01:20:27.110 --> 01:20:29.160
I think it's very cool that you found your dad.

1907
01:20:29.160 --> 01:20:30.940
I feel like the moral of the last couple of months

1908
01:20:30.940 --> 01:20:32.630
is dads can do some messed up things.

1909
01:20:32.630 --> 01:20:34.930
I don't know if he's my dad,

1910
01:20:34.930 --> 01:20:37.093
he's not going to do anything uncool is really the moral

1911
01:20:37.093 --> 01:20:38.810
we're supposed to walk away with.

1912
01:20:38.810 --> 01:20:40.810
I'm pretty sure that's what it is.

1913
01:20:40.810 --> 01:20:41.643
Okay.

1914
01:20:43.910 --> 01:20:44.880
Well, we have options.

1915
01:20:44.880 --> 01:20:46.660
We can go to the Leaky Tap,

1916
01:20:46.660 --> 01:20:48.340
we can go to the Evening Nip,

1917
01:20:48.340 --> 01:20:50.040
we can go the Song and Supper Inn.

1918
01:20:50.040 --> 01:20:51.350
It's a karaoke bar.

1919
01:20:51.350 --> 01:20:52.886
We can go up to the Pillow Trove.

1920
01:20:52.886 --> 01:20:54.050
(laughter)

1921
01:20:54.050 --> 01:20:58.320
We can go to Chastity's Nook Porn Shop.

1922
01:20:58.320 --> 01:21:00.190
We can go to--
Always a solid option.

1923
01:21:00.190 --> 01:21:01.330
Karaoke bar that only has public--

1924
01:21:01.330 --> 01:21:03.030
Poobah and Souls.

1925
01:21:03.030 --> 01:21:05.060
Did we have anything, is he making us anything?

1926
01:21:05.060 --> 01:21:05.893
Nope.
Okay.

1927
01:21:05.893 --> 01:21:07.363
There's a porn shop?

1928
01:21:07.363 --> 01:21:08.510
There's a porn shop.
No, no.

1929
01:21:08.510 --> 01:21:11.280
It wasn't really porn, it was more like cheap--

1930
01:21:11.280 --> 01:21:12.330
Tusk Love, Yasha.

1931
01:21:13.507 --> 01:21:14.570
Does anybody got a Player's Handbook?

1932
01:21:14.570 --> 01:21:17.050
Oh, that's right.
Nope.

1933
01:21:17.050 --> 01:21:18.180
Here's one right there.

1934
01:21:19.165 --> 01:21:21.200
Are we going to go to the karaoke place?

1935
01:21:21.200 --> 01:21:24.040
No, it's too loud at the karaoke place.

1936
01:21:24.040 --> 01:21:24.873
Let's go to The Gentleman's.

1937
01:21:24.873 --> 01:21:25.706
People sing.

1938
01:21:25.706 --> 01:21:27.190
Yeah, let's go to--
What's wrong with singing?

1939
01:21:27.190 --> 01:21:28.340
Singing's nice.

1940
01:21:29.340 --> 01:21:31.600
When people do karaoke, they try too hard.

1941
01:21:32.540 --> 01:21:33.860
No, you have your song that you go,

1942
01:21:33.860 --> 01:21:35.940
you have a song that you always sing,

1943
01:21:35.940 --> 01:21:37.140
and you're good at it.
Do you have a song

1944
01:21:37.140 --> 01:21:38.010
that you always sing?

1945
01:21:38.010 --> 01:21:38.843
What do you sing?

1946
01:21:38.843 --> 01:21:40.170
Sweet Caroline.
(laughter)

1947
01:21:40.170 --> 01:21:41.670
How does it go?

1948
01:21:41.670 --> 01:21:44.090
Well, it's in--
(laughter)

1949
01:21:44.090 --> 01:21:47.410
It's in Abyssal.
(laughter)

1950
01:21:47.410 --> 01:21:49.280
I want to speak Abyssal,

1951
01:21:49.280 --> 01:21:51.260
so I'll know exactly what you're singing.

1952
01:21:51.260 --> 01:21:54.177
(laughter)

1953
01:21:59.380 --> 01:22:00.500
It goes like this.

1954
01:22:02.921 --> 01:22:05.830
(singing in foreign language)

1955
01:22:05.830 --> 01:22:07.707
♪ Bum, bum, bum ♪

1956
01:22:07.707 --> 01:22:11.540
(singing in foreign language)

1957
01:22:14.168 --> 01:22:16.210
♪ Bah, bah, bah ♪

1958
01:22:16.210 --> 01:22:19.596
(singing in foreign language)

1959
01:22:19.596 --> 01:22:20.820
(laughter)
Oh.

1960
01:22:22.420 --> 01:22:23.253
Wow.

1961
01:22:23.253 --> 01:22:26.730
I feel like a lot of those,

1962
01:22:26.730 --> 01:22:29.667
you said, you had sentences that sometimes

1963
01:22:29.667 --> 01:22:32.640
didn't make sense.
(laughter)

1964
01:22:32.640 --> 01:22:35.210
I learned it like third hand,

1965
01:22:35.210 --> 01:22:37.293
and I think, all the people, you know,

1966
01:22:37.293 --> 01:22:39.660
they had a selection of songs,

1967
01:22:39.660 --> 01:22:41.050
and some of them were in Abyssal.

1968
01:22:41.050 --> 01:22:43.891
I think they got their book from an Abyssal karaoke bar?

1969
01:22:43.891 --> 01:22:45.290
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1970
01:22:45.290 --> 01:22:46.450
Or something, and so--
That's weird

1971
01:22:46.450 --> 01:22:47.800
that that's your go to, though.

1972
01:22:47.800 --> 01:22:49.690
Well, I mean, nobody sang those songs,

1973
01:22:49.690 --> 01:22:51.960
so I felt like those were more open game.

1974
01:22:51.960 --> 01:22:54.660
Everyone kept singing the same songs all the time.

1975
01:22:54.660 --> 01:22:56.580
Yeah, because you said something like,

1976
01:22:56.580 --> 01:23:00.610
"Good times never felt so flute."

1977
01:23:00.610 --> 01:23:04.280
It was like wrong--
Kind of conjugation.

1978
01:23:04.280 --> 01:23:06.050
Well, no, that these good times

1979
01:23:06.050 --> 01:23:08.030
never felt so good, I think.

1980
01:23:08.030 --> 01:23:09.070
That makes a lot more sense.

1981
01:23:09.070 --> 01:23:10.190
That doesn't make any sense.

1982
01:23:10.190 --> 01:23:11.790
Good times never felt so good?

1983
01:23:11.790 --> 01:23:13.350
What's the lyrics?
Stupid lyrics.

1984
01:23:13.350 --> 01:23:14.234
Some lazy songwriting.

1985
01:23:14.234 --> 01:23:16.950
♪ Good times never felt so good ♪

1986
01:23:16.950 --> 01:23:17.950
♪ Blah blah blah ♪
That's stupid.

1987
01:23:17.950 --> 01:23:19.940
I think it's flute.
Listen.

1988
01:23:19.940 --> 01:23:21.590
Good times never felt so flute.

1989
01:23:23.902 --> 01:23:24.930
What the shit is going on?

1990
01:23:24.930 --> 01:23:26.870
So karaoke or?
No.

1991
01:23:26.870 --> 01:23:28.730
Leaky Nip?
No. (laughs)

1992
01:23:28.730 --> 01:23:30.300
Leaky Nip.
Leaky Nip.

1993
01:23:30.300 --> 01:23:31.940
Yeah, we already got some music from--

1994
01:23:31.940 --> 01:23:35.040
There's the Leaky Tap and there's the Evening Nip.

1995
01:23:35.040 --> 01:23:36.580
Where you going? (laughs)

1996
01:23:36.580 --> 01:23:37.530
The Evening Nip.

1997
01:23:37.530 --> 01:23:40.240
We open our own tavern.
Leaky Nip.

1998
01:23:40.240 --> 01:23:41.340
In between the two places.

1999
01:23:41.340 --> 01:23:42.610
We're going to the Gentleman's.

2000
01:23:42.610 --> 01:23:44.480
I'm kind of into this.
Okay.

2001
01:23:44.480 --> 01:23:45.800
All righty.

2002
01:23:45.800 --> 01:23:46.940
We should save money for this.

2003
01:23:46.940 --> 01:23:49.290
It's a good idea. (laughs)

2004
01:23:49.290 --> 01:23:50.430
All righty.

2005
01:23:50.430 --> 01:23:51.840
Both businesses hate us.

2006
01:23:53.410 --> 01:23:57.170
So, you make your way to the familiar dive bar

2007
01:23:57.170 --> 01:23:59.550
that is the Evening Nip.

2008
01:23:59.550 --> 01:24:01.290
Your remember, you get a password,

2009
01:24:01.290 --> 01:24:04.110
and are let down within the subterranean bar.

2010
01:24:04.110 --> 01:24:05.680
It's a bit empty at the moment.

2011
01:24:05.680 --> 01:24:08.950
At this point, not entire sure whether people are busy

2012
01:24:08.950 --> 01:24:11.220
or have other business to take care of.

2013
01:24:11.220 --> 01:24:12.690
The Gentleman is not immediately in the bar,

2014
01:24:12.690 --> 01:24:14.110
but you are recognized upon arrival,

2015
01:24:14.110 --> 01:24:17.640
and are allowed your use of the space.

2016
01:24:17.640 --> 01:24:19.119
There is a bartender there who's in the process

2017
01:24:19.119 --> 01:24:21.100
of half-sleeping in the corner,

2018
01:24:21.100 --> 01:24:22.140
that as soon as you approach,

2019
01:24:22.140 --> 01:24:26.580
and speak with the familiar ogre bodyguard

2020
01:24:26.580 --> 01:24:29.520
at the interior, he's like, (grunting)

2021
01:24:29.520 --> 01:24:31.520
All right, lets you in.

2022
01:24:31.520 --> 01:24:35.560
The bartender shoots up and can I get you drinks?

2023
01:24:35.560 --> 01:24:38.226
Yeah, my dad said give us whatever we want.

2024
01:24:38.226 --> 01:24:41.160
(laughs) Oh, she's a loud and crazy guy.

2025
01:24:42.890 --> 01:24:44.670
What would you want then?

2026
01:24:44.670 --> 01:24:45.720
Whatever they want.

2027
01:24:47.560 --> 01:24:48.760
Whiskey.
Whiskey.

2028
01:24:48.760 --> 01:24:50.103
Whiskey all round.

2029
01:24:50.103 --> 01:24:50.936
Whiskey.
Here.

2030
01:24:50.936 --> 01:24:53.120
Whiskey juice.
Whiskey juice?

2031
01:24:53.120 --> 01:24:53.953
Milk.

2032
01:24:55.175 --> 01:24:58.130
I really hope he brings you a whiskey juice.

2033
01:24:58.130 --> 01:24:59.690
What's a whiskey juice?
Exactly.

2034
01:24:59.690 --> 01:25:00.890
Did you find out?

2035
01:25:00.890 --> 01:25:03.990
He brings around--
A case of whiskey juice--

2036
01:25:03.990 --> 01:25:06.480
A shot of whiskey, a shot of whiskey, a shot of whiskey,

2037
01:25:06.480 --> 01:25:08.940
a shot of whiskey, milk, juice, whiskey.

2038
01:25:11.130 --> 01:25:12.620
All right, bottoms up.

2039
01:25:12.620 --> 01:25:17.470
That is a very, very terrible tasting, strong,

2040
01:25:17.470 --> 01:25:20.730
pungent juice, very strong bite to it.

2041
01:25:20.730 --> 01:25:22.530
I got something for this, hold on.

2042
01:25:23.690 --> 01:25:24.740
Same with the milk.

2043
01:25:26.080 --> 01:25:27.970
That's a whiskey milk.
Oh.

2044
01:25:29.480 --> 01:25:31.510
That's a whiskey milk.

2045
01:25:31.510 --> 01:25:32.343
I'm going to put a little--

2046
01:25:32.343 --> 01:25:33.176
Partially curdled.

2047
01:25:33.176 --> 01:25:34.009
Ugh.
Just a tiny bit

2048
01:25:34.009 --> 01:25:35.240
of that I've saving some of that--

2049
01:25:35.240 --> 01:25:36.440
Put some whipped cream on it.

2050
01:25:36.440 --> 01:25:38.780
Hallucinogenic fruit that I've now preserved

2051
01:25:38.780 --> 01:25:39.613
as best I can.

2052
01:25:39.613 --> 01:25:41.310
I'm just going to use it like nutmeg,

2053
01:25:41.310 --> 01:25:42.570
and see if I can fix this.

2054
01:25:42.570 --> 01:25:43.403
Put some in here, too.

2055
01:25:43.403 --> 01:25:44.236
Yeah, okay.

2056
01:25:44.236 --> 01:25:45.110
Here we go.
Okay.

2057
01:25:46.180 --> 01:25:47.013
Upgrading this night.

2058
01:25:47.013 --> 01:25:48.756
Are you making a white Xhorhasian again?

2059
01:25:48.756 --> 01:25:52.120
(laughs) It helps with the sting of the flavor.

2060
01:25:52.120 --> 01:25:53.020
Oh, I love that.

2061
01:25:54.760 --> 01:25:56.310
Yeah.

2062
01:25:56.310 --> 01:25:58.020
So you enjoy some drinks,

2063
01:25:58.020 --> 01:25:59.880
you have a space, you know,

2064
01:25:59.880 --> 01:26:00.750
to relax for a bit.

2065
01:26:00.750 --> 01:26:03.180
Gonna ask around for your pops or no?

2066
01:26:03.180 --> 01:26:06.590
Yeah, I'm going to go find my dad's office, go say hello.

2067
01:26:06.590 --> 01:26:07.640
Okay. (laughs)

2068
01:26:07.640 --> 01:26:10.450
I'm going to cast Disguise Self to still look just like me,

2069
01:26:10.450 --> 01:26:13.007
except Fjord in my clothes with my hair.

2070
01:26:13.007 --> 01:26:16.150
I knew it.
(laughter)

2071
01:26:16.150 --> 01:26:19.700
Just trying to be off in the periphery,

2072
01:26:19.700 --> 01:26:20.533
sitting next to you.

2073
01:26:20.533 --> 01:26:22.230
But you're super tall now.

2074
01:26:22.230 --> 01:26:24.430
No, I can actually--
Oh.

2075
01:26:24.430 --> 01:26:25.610
Yeah, I can do that.

2076
01:26:25.610 --> 01:26:28.260
Jester, have you ever had alcohol before?

2077
01:26:28.260 --> 01:26:29.202
Yes.
You have?

2078
01:26:29.202 --> 01:26:30.035
Yeah.

2079
01:26:30.035 --> 01:26:33.420
But not many times.
Not many times.

2080
01:26:33.420 --> 01:26:35.350
I didn't down my milk, you can have my milk,

2081
01:26:35.350 --> 01:26:36.900
whiskey milk if you want to.

2082
01:26:36.900 --> 01:26:40.380
I feel like, I, okay.

2083
01:26:40.380 --> 01:26:41.690
It's got some lumps in it.

2084
01:26:41.690 --> 01:26:42.550
That's, you know.

2085
01:26:43.480 --> 01:26:44.840
Oh, it would curdle.

2086
01:26:44.840 --> 01:26:47.340
Yeah, it'd curdle.
It'd curdle, oh.

2087
01:26:48.380 --> 01:26:50.380
It's chewy.
(groaning)

2088
01:26:50.380 --> 01:26:52.580
Interesting taste.
It's got chunks.

2089
01:26:52.580 --> 01:26:54.870
Yeah, I feel like I would just get the whiskey

2090
01:26:54.870 --> 01:26:56.240
next time, maybe.
Yeah.

2091
01:26:57.488 --> 01:26:58.530
You're starting to feel a little funny.

2092
01:26:58.530 --> 01:26:59.840
That is, yeah.

2093
01:27:01.620 --> 01:27:04.150
Hello, I'm Fjord.
(Nott and Jester gasping)

2094
01:27:04.150 --> 01:27:05.270
Try it, wait, wait.

2095
01:27:05.270 --> 01:27:08.160
You lost your accent.
Hello, I'm Fjord.

2096
01:27:08.160 --> 01:27:10.860
Yeah, it's--
Are you being old Fjord

2097
01:27:10.860 --> 01:27:12.290
or current Fjord?

2098
01:27:12.290 --> 01:27:14.310
Trying to do your accent.

2099
01:27:14.310 --> 01:27:16.439
It's--
Oh, he's going--

2100
01:27:16.439 --> 01:27:19.150
Hello, all.
That's very close.

2101
01:27:19.150 --> 01:27:20.850
That's pretty good.
That's not bad, yeah.

2102
01:27:20.850 --> 01:27:22.090
Say this, say this.

2103
01:27:22.090 --> 01:27:23.010
Say this.
I don't know,

2104
01:27:23.010 --> 01:27:24.770
I can't remember.

2105
01:27:24.770 --> 01:27:26.940
I don't know, I can't remember.

2106
01:27:26.940 --> 01:27:29.210
It's just like him.
No, I can't remember.

2107
01:27:29.210 --> 01:27:31.120
I can't, like I can't remember.

2108
01:27:31.120 --> 01:27:32.670
Hit us with a Eldritch Blast.

2109
01:27:36.860 --> 01:27:39.410
Eldritch Blast, ooh, that's hard to say.

2110
01:27:39.410 --> 01:27:40.760
Blast, blast.
You got caught up

2111
01:27:40.760 --> 01:27:41.861
in the moment, and you're just like,

2112
01:27:41.861 --> 01:27:44.360
just, drift--
It's really cool

2113
01:27:44.360 --> 01:27:45.420
when you do that, though.

2114
01:27:45.420 --> 01:27:47.130
It is just one of the, you know, you know,

2115
01:27:47.130 --> 01:27:48.640
it's pretty cool when you do that.

2116
01:27:48.640 --> 01:27:50.150
As you come to the office door--

2117
01:27:50.150 --> 01:27:50.983
Dad!

2118
01:27:50.983 --> 01:27:52.890
Dad, Dad, it's me.

2119
01:27:54.360 --> 01:27:55.440
Yes?

2120
01:27:55.440 --> 01:27:58.070
Dad, it's Jester, I'm here to say hi.

2121
01:27:58.070 --> 01:28:00.226
Open the door.
Okay.

2122
01:28:00.226 --> 01:28:01.580
Hi.

2123
01:28:01.580 --> 01:28:04.280
As you walk inside his office, you can see there's,

2124
01:28:04.280 --> 01:28:07.410
his desk currently is strewn with some papers,

2125
01:28:07.410 --> 01:28:09.570
and he's putting something away,

2126
01:28:09.570 --> 01:28:12.660
and turning in his chair toward you.

2127
01:28:12.660 --> 01:28:14.920
Ah, I had no idea you'd be joining me.

2128
01:28:15.800 --> 01:28:17.330
Well, I didn't either.

2129
01:28:17.330 --> 01:28:18.900
We just found out.

2130
01:28:18.900 --> 01:28:20.110
Oh, welcome.

2131
01:28:21.440 --> 01:28:22.960
Are your friends here as well?

2132
01:28:22.960 --> 01:28:24.480
They are, they're drinking.

2133
01:28:25.760 --> 01:28:27.280
I told them it's on the house.

2134
01:28:28.600 --> 01:28:31.890
Sure.
(laughter)

2135
01:28:31.890 --> 01:28:34.270
So what have you been up to?

2136
01:28:35.800 --> 01:28:36.633
Business.

2137
01:28:38.680 --> 01:28:39.900
What have you been up to?

2138
01:28:39.900 --> 01:28:42.250
Oh my God, just don't, I tell him everything.

2139
01:28:42.250 --> 01:28:44.520
Just like launch into the whole thing.

2140
01:28:46.031 --> 01:28:48.290
As it progresses, he just leans further

2141
01:28:48.290 --> 01:28:49.440
and further back in his chair,

2142
01:28:49.440 --> 01:28:51.670
until he hits the back of the chair.

2143
01:28:51.670 --> 01:28:53.780
Yeah, so anyway, we got to find this weird,

2144
01:28:53.780 --> 01:28:56.810
creepy lady who totally saw me scrying on her.

2145
01:28:56.810 --> 01:28:58.310
We got to find out what the deal with it is,

2146
01:28:58.310 --> 01:28:59.710
we can break the curse, then,

2147
01:28:59.710 --> 01:29:01.745
we going to to go to the negotiations,

2148
01:29:01.745 --> 01:29:04.100
then Traveler Con, and somewhere,

2149
01:29:04.100 --> 01:29:07.020
we're fitting into that Clay's family stuff.

2150
01:29:11.150 --> 01:29:14.300
One of these days, I'm going to have to teach you

2151
01:29:15.440 --> 01:29:17.420
something I've learned at a very young age,

2152
01:29:17.420 --> 01:29:20.850
which is how to not have to do everything yourself.

2153
01:29:22.270 --> 01:29:23.850
It's much easier.

2154
01:29:23.850 --> 01:29:25.470
Okay, I'm okay with that.

2155
01:29:26.390 --> 01:29:28.060
Teach me your ways.

2156
01:29:29.020 --> 01:29:31.040
In time.
Have you called Mom?

2157
01:29:31.040 --> 01:29:32.800
Have you sent her a letter?

2158
01:29:32.800 --> 01:29:33.650
Have you gone to see her?

2159
01:29:33.650 --> 01:29:35.918
Have you been like, oh my gosh, I miss you?

2160
01:29:35.918 --> 01:29:37.240
(tense music)

2161
01:29:37.240 --> 01:29:40.090
No, there's been a lot to take care of here.

2162
01:29:40.090 --> 01:29:42.080
There's, in the midst of,

2163
01:29:44.360 --> 01:29:47.170
conflict, if done right, in the Empire,

2164
01:29:47.170 --> 01:29:48.520
can be a very profitable endeavor,

2165
01:29:48.520 --> 01:29:52.423
but one has to be very on top of their organization

2166
01:29:54.990 --> 01:29:59.890
to maintain it, so I've been, been working a lot.

2167
01:30:01.370 --> 01:30:02.620
Will you make me, well,

2168
01:30:04.024 --> 01:30:05.174
will you do me a favor?

2169
01:30:06.640 --> 01:30:08.300
Possibly.

2170
01:30:08.300 --> 01:30:12.430
If, by any chance, when people offer you things

2171
01:30:12.430 --> 01:30:15.780
or whatever, you come across smuggled items

2172
01:30:16.890 --> 01:30:20.240
that resemble the beacons that I told you about--

2173
01:30:21.350 --> 01:30:22.600
Right, right.

2174
01:30:22.600 --> 01:30:24.880
If you come across anything like that,

2175
01:30:24.880 --> 01:30:27.030
will you let me know before you try to sell

2176
01:30:27.030 --> 01:30:28.230
it another person?

2177
01:30:31.570 --> 01:30:33.200
For you, yes.

2178
01:30:33.200 --> 01:30:34.033
Thank you.

2179
01:30:36.460 --> 01:30:38.370
I'll send you messages every once in awhile

2180
01:30:38.370 --> 01:30:40.970
just so you can get it to me, if you, you know.

2181
01:30:40.970 --> 01:30:42.450
Because we travel around a lot.

2182
01:30:42.450 --> 01:30:43.950
You won't know where I am, so.

2183
01:30:44.930 --> 01:30:46.430
Of course.
Okay.

2184
01:30:47.570 --> 01:30:51.700
If I don't respond, don't take it personally.

2185
01:30:51.700 --> 01:30:52.920
I might be indisposed.

2186
01:30:54.300 --> 01:30:55.290
Like how?

2187
01:30:56.590 --> 01:30:58.170
Many things.

2188
01:30:58.170 --> 01:30:59.750
Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, here's the thing.

2189
01:30:59.750 --> 01:31:01.200
What if I send you a message,

2190
01:31:02.390 --> 01:31:05.560
and you should have a way to communicate with me

2191
01:31:05.560 --> 01:31:06.590
that you're indisposed,

2192
01:31:06.590 --> 01:31:09.420
like so I can know that you're not just in trouble

2193
01:31:09.420 --> 01:31:13.050
but you're boning somebody, or you're in a meeting

2194
01:31:13.050 --> 01:31:17.240
or something, you could be like, or you could be like,

2195
01:31:17.240 --> 01:31:19.510
what if you just cough when I send,

2196
01:31:19.510 --> 01:31:21.440
or you say like.

2197
01:31:23.250 --> 01:31:24.430
A cough, a cough would do well.

2198
01:31:24.430 --> 01:31:25.510
Okay.
I'll cough,

2199
01:31:25.510 --> 01:31:28.120
and we'll pick it up another time.

2200
01:31:28.120 --> 01:31:30.470
All right, all right, all right.

2201
01:31:30.470 --> 01:31:31.820
Look at us, we have a code.

2202
01:31:33.280 --> 01:31:36.280
Can I sleep in the room tonight that you said we could have?

2203
01:31:38.610 --> 01:31:41.120
Sure, sure.

2204
01:31:41.120 --> 01:31:42.970
Thank you, Dad.
I'll arrange it.

2205
01:31:46.260 --> 01:31:47.480
He laughs in spite of himself.

2206
01:31:47.480 --> 01:31:49.900
You can see him trying to organize being in a deep

2207
01:31:49.900 --> 01:31:54.050
moment of thought and the whirlwind of chaos

2208
01:31:54.050 --> 01:31:56.390
that is Jester just blowing in like a storm,

2209
01:31:57.470 --> 01:31:59.130
and in spite of his momentary frustration,

2210
01:31:59.130 --> 01:32:00.680
he can't help but crack a smile.

2211
01:32:02.490 --> 01:32:04.650
Well, say hello to your friends for me.

2212
01:32:05.690 --> 01:32:06.523
Okay.

2213
01:32:06.523 --> 01:32:07.650
Close the door on your way out.

2214
01:32:07.650 --> 01:32:09.570
I will.

2215
01:32:12.616 --> 01:32:13.900
We have a room!

2216
01:32:13.900 --> 01:32:16.140
So do you have to say Eldritch Blast every time,

2217
01:32:16.140 --> 01:32:18.310
or is that part of the spell, or do you just do it

2218
01:32:18.310 --> 01:32:20.490
because it's just, like, I've always wondered

2219
01:32:20.490 --> 01:32:23.461
is it just like--
Showmanship, right?

2220
01:32:23.461 --> 01:32:26.740
So it's like going whoosh, when you're like--

2221
01:32:26.740 --> 01:32:29.340
It's also like stay clear, because shit's about to go down.

2222
01:32:29.340 --> 01:32:31.670
Oh, so it's for us--
Hey, Eldritch Blast.

2223
01:32:31.670 --> 01:32:33.430
Oh, that's--
You could try it

2224
01:32:33.430 --> 01:32:34.263
for other things.

2225
01:32:34.263 --> 01:32:36.410
You could say, "Magician's Judge,"

2226
01:32:36.410 --> 01:32:38.000
and be really like, judge!

2227
01:32:38.000 --> 01:32:39.770
I'm going to hit you.

2228
01:32:39.770 --> 01:32:41.800
A little, maybe work that phrase more.

2229
01:32:41.800 --> 01:32:43.050
It's kind of ordinary.

2230
01:32:43.050 --> 01:32:44.140
I'm going to kill you.

2231
01:32:44.140 --> 01:32:46.270
I'm going to heal you.
Yeah.

2232
01:32:46.270 --> 01:32:47.370
Ooh, that's good, too.
I like it.

2233
01:32:47.370 --> 01:32:49.390
Here it comes.
You're okay.

2234
01:32:49.390 --> 01:32:51.750
Sometimes, though, it's also good not to telegraph

2235
01:32:51.750 --> 01:32:53.360
what you're about to do before you do it,

2236
01:32:53.360 --> 01:32:54.960
because then you surprise them more.

2237
01:32:54.960 --> 01:32:56.380
What if you go, I'm going to heal you,

2238
01:32:56.380 --> 01:32:58.170
and then, you Magician's Judge them.

2239
01:32:58.170 --> 01:33:00.110
Or branding's very important, so maybe instead of,

2240
01:33:00.110 --> 01:33:03.200
I'm going to hit you, I'm going to judge you.

2241
01:33:03.200 --> 01:33:05.640
Ooh.
Oh, wow.

2242
01:33:05.640 --> 01:33:08.290
You have been judged!
Oh, that's good.

2243
01:33:08.290 --> 01:33:09.670
That's good, that's after you've killed him.

2244
01:33:09.670 --> 01:33:11.960
And the jury's going to deliberate.

2245
01:33:11.960 --> 01:33:12.793
That's good.

2246
01:33:12.793 --> 01:33:14.030
And Caduceus could be like,

2247
01:33:14.030 --> 01:33:16.900
"I'm going to duck and drop a deuce on you."

2248
01:33:16.900 --> 01:33:17.733
Ooh.

2249
01:33:17.733 --> 01:33:20.230
I'm going to do the deuce.
Yep.

2250
01:33:20.230 --> 01:33:22.880
Wait, Jester, how did it go with your dad?

2251
01:33:22.880 --> 01:33:25.590
Oh my God, you guys, he loves me so much.

2252
01:33:26.678 --> 01:33:27.769
Of course he does.

2253
01:33:27.769 --> 01:33:30.096
What's there not to love?
What's not to love?

2254
01:33:30.096 --> 01:33:32.330
(laughs) He said you could have a room,

2255
01:33:32.330 --> 01:33:34.840
he said that we could have free drinks,

2256
01:33:34.840 --> 01:33:38.870
he said that if he runs across any beacons,

2257
01:33:38.870 --> 01:33:39.703
he'll let us know.

2258
01:33:39.703 --> 01:33:40.536
Oh, that's nice.

2259
01:33:40.536 --> 01:33:41.831
That's great.
Yeah.

2260
01:33:41.831 --> 01:33:45.140
Did you happen to ask him about any magical women

2261
01:33:45.140 --> 01:33:46.590
hid in the woods or anything?

2262
01:33:46.590 --> 01:33:48.130
No, I mean, we already know--

2263
01:33:48.130 --> 01:33:49.350
Okay, okay.
What exactly

2264
01:33:49.350 --> 01:33:51.470
we're looking for here.
Or maybe he's interacted

2265
01:33:51.470 --> 01:33:53.720
with her in the past.
Oh my God.

2266
01:33:53.720 --> 01:33:57.170
I'll pick up my jacket and head over to where Beau is.

2267
01:33:57.170 --> 01:33:58.003
Mm.

2268
01:34:00.340 --> 01:34:01.340
How are you doing?

2269
01:34:05.351 --> 01:34:06.184
I'm great.

2270
01:34:08.340 --> 01:34:11.480
Your histamine reactions are going again.

2271
01:34:12.910 --> 01:34:14.382
Yeah.

2272
01:34:14.382 --> 01:34:16.010
I've been away from Zadash for a little bit,

2273
01:34:16.010 --> 01:34:18.670
so the pollen, it's kicking a little, you know?

2274
01:34:20.981 --> 01:34:25.223
I take it you don't fully, fully hate your dad.

2275
01:34:27.243 --> 01:34:29.320
It's going to be hard to hear this.

2276
01:34:30.315 --> 01:34:33.982
(uplifting adventure music)

2277
01:34:35.060 --> 01:34:37.340
Everyone wants to make their dad proud, you know?

2278
01:34:44.890 --> 01:34:45.940
Just hoping he could,

2279
01:34:52.200 --> 01:34:53.710
he could show some of that.

2280
01:34:58.310 --> 01:34:59.570
You don't know that he can't.

2281
01:35:01.120 --> 01:35:02.040
It's been years.

2282
01:35:04.060 --> 01:35:05.580
You've grown, you've changed.

2283
01:35:08.010 --> 01:35:10.970
I'm sure you were even more of an unbearable shit before.

2284
01:35:15.693 --> 01:35:17.870
I'm not saying he deserves a second chance, but,

2285
01:35:21.010 --> 01:35:23.010
he is your father, and you do have a mother

2286
01:35:23.010 --> 01:35:24.810
and a brother that you've never met.

2287
01:35:28.531 --> 01:35:31.198
(Beau sniffing)

2288
01:35:32.740 --> 01:35:34.220
I guess it's hard when,

2289
01:35:44.080 --> 01:35:47.300
the word inevitable has been brought up several times

2290
01:35:47.300 --> 01:35:49.150
in the past 24 hours amongst us.

2291
01:35:53.673 --> 01:35:56.953
I feel like I've found my family with The Mighty Nein.

2292
01:35:58.560 --> 01:36:00.000
I don't like looking at my past,

2293
01:36:00.000 --> 01:36:04.550
because it doesn't have The Mighty Nein in it,

2294
01:36:08.890 --> 01:36:10.740
and I think I put off the inevitable,

2295
01:36:15.040 --> 01:36:18.680
because I'm going to, I'm afraid it's going to be like my past.

2296
01:36:25.350 --> 01:36:27.440
I don't think one contaminates the other.

2297
01:36:30.070 --> 01:36:32.510
You've got good, solid footing here.

2298
01:36:35.596 --> 01:36:37.730
I mean, shit, if we want to run, we run.

2299
01:36:37.730 --> 01:36:40.310
If we want to kick his ass, we'll kick his ass.

2300
01:36:42.040 --> 01:36:44.518
Yeah. (sniffing)

2301
01:36:44.518 --> 01:36:45.868
I don't want to kick his ass,

2302
01:36:48.557 --> 01:36:49.657
and I don't want to run.

2303
01:36:52.490 --> 01:36:56.770
Could I ask you, in your wildest dreams,

2304
01:36:56.770 --> 01:36:59.420
and feel free to say you don't want to tell me,

2305
01:37:01.160 --> 01:37:03.484
what would you have happen when we go there?

2306
01:37:03.484 --> 01:37:06.817
(tense adventure music)

2307
01:37:12.100 --> 01:37:13.920
I think I've worked so hard

2308
01:37:17.500 --> 01:37:20.630
because I scripted this day,

2309
01:37:24.580 --> 01:37:29.170
in my inevitable future that I would go back to him,

2310
01:37:30.750 --> 01:37:34.960
successful woman, respectable member of society,

2311
01:37:37.400 --> 01:37:39.340
Cobalt Soul, and Expositor,

2312
01:37:41.350 --> 01:37:44.420
the thing he threw me away to, and I embraced.

2313
01:37:48.990 --> 01:37:52.180
And then, I would get mad at myself,

2314
01:37:52.180 --> 01:37:55.380
because I felt like I was doing exactly

2315
01:37:55.380 --> 01:37:58.560
what he was doing to me my entire life,

2316
01:37:58.560 --> 01:38:02.460
scripting me to be something else.

2317
01:38:05.370 --> 01:38:07.740
And I'm still doing it.

2318
01:38:11.809 --> 01:38:13.530
I haven't seen him in three years,

2319
01:38:13.530 --> 01:38:15.907
and I'm still trying to be something,

2320
01:38:22.470 --> 01:38:25.597
and I think what's scary is that I like this,

2321
01:38:28.730 --> 01:38:31.770
and what I've found, and I don't think it was until

2322
01:38:34.030 --> 01:38:37.920
Nott started talking about having to go home

2323
01:38:40.370 --> 01:38:44.860
and go away that it truly started terrifying me.

2324
01:38:46.597 --> 01:38:50.014
(upbeat adventure music)

2325
01:38:51.810 --> 01:38:53.660
Because for the first time, I'm happy.

2326
01:38:57.840 --> 01:38:59.190
And what if that goes away?

2327
01:39:03.009 --> 01:39:04.190
It could always go away.

2328
01:39:05.071 --> 01:39:06.321
It could go away tonight.

2329
01:39:07.240 --> 01:39:09.618
The Gentleman's debtors could come calling.

2330
01:39:09.618 --> 01:39:12.379
(Beau chuckling)

2331
01:39:12.379 --> 01:39:13.860
And I think I know that,

2332
01:39:13.860 --> 01:39:17.720
and I think I say things to not like,

2333
01:39:20.330 --> 01:39:22.980
you don't have to put those stipulations on yourself,

2334
01:39:24.060 --> 01:39:25.850
because I've convinced myself that

2335
01:39:29.680 --> 01:39:33.600
destiny or the inevitability won't come knocking.

2336
01:39:35.370 --> 01:39:40.280
If you ignore it, it won't exist, and that's not true.

2337
01:39:44.236 --> 01:39:46.819
(both sighing)

2338
01:39:51.050 --> 01:39:52.750
It'll be interesting either way.

2339
01:39:54.750 --> 01:39:57.480
Your face is leaking.

2340
01:39:58.741 --> 01:39:59.940
I hate it.

2341
01:39:59.940 --> 01:40:01.450
I won't tell--
Don't tell anybody.

2342
01:40:01.450 --> 01:40:02.970
Yep.

2343
01:40:02.970 --> 01:40:05.550
You're a good friend, you're a good trainer.

2344
01:40:08.290 --> 01:40:09.720
We're still working out tomorrow.

2345
01:40:13.512 --> 01:40:15.870
So I don't know if you give a fuck is all I'm saying.

2346
01:40:19.970 --> 01:40:22.250
Fair enough.

2347
01:40:26.370 --> 01:40:27.203
Thank you.

2348
01:40:29.110 --> 01:40:29.943
Of course.

2349
01:40:32.189 --> 01:40:33.670
And you're still my captain.

2350
01:40:36.920 --> 01:40:39.560
Ball eater or no.
Okay.

2351
01:40:39.560 --> 01:40:43.230
(laughter)
Come back Thursday.

2352
01:40:48.140 --> 01:40:48.973
Thank you.

2353
01:40:54.010 --> 01:40:57.470
Then you guys finish your drinks,

2354
01:40:57.470 --> 01:41:01.940
wind down for the night, share a bit of a rousing toast

2355
01:41:01.940 --> 01:41:03.670
with the Gentleman as we he emerges from his work

2356
01:41:03.670 --> 01:41:06.550
for the day, to congratulate you on the multitude of things

2357
01:41:06.550 --> 01:41:09.000
that he seems to know about.
(Jester laughing)

2358
01:41:09.000 --> 01:41:11.490
Every detail of your travels.
Hey.

2359
01:41:11.490 --> 01:41:12.323
Wait, what I'd miss?

2360
01:41:12.323 --> 01:41:14.230
How does he, what'd I miss?

2361
01:41:17.130 --> 01:41:18.580
Just have a drink.
Okay.

2362
01:41:21.020 --> 01:41:24.080
You're all very talented, it seems,

2363
01:41:24.080 --> 01:41:26.430
or extremely stupid, or both.

2364
01:41:26.430 --> 01:41:27.590
Yeah, it's a bit of both.

2365
01:41:28.670 --> 01:41:31.220
That's a rare combination, but it'll keep you alive.

2366
01:41:32.910 --> 01:41:33.800
Listen to her.

2367
01:41:35.650 --> 01:41:37.420
What?
Listen to Jester?

2368
01:41:37.420 --> 01:41:39.470
Always.
Good.

2369
01:41:45.115 --> 01:41:46.615
She's got a good blood in her.

2370
01:41:49.590 --> 01:41:52.339
Now, rest up.

2371
01:41:52.339 --> 01:41:55.890
Apparently, you've got a bit of travel to do in the morning.

2372
01:41:55.890 --> 01:41:57.810
I like, I sort of told him what we were doing.

2373
01:41:57.810 --> 01:41:59.360
That's okay, he's your dad.

2374
01:41:59.360 --> 01:42:01.300
You can trust him.
Yeah.

2375
01:42:01.300 --> 01:42:03.370
I need to go blow off some steam.

2376
01:42:05.470 --> 01:42:07.050
Don't message me for awhile.

2377
01:42:07.050 --> 01:42:09.380
Oh, he's going to go bone somebody, gross.

2378
01:42:09.380 --> 01:42:13.530
Oh, if you're going to, maybe, you might want to just,

2379
01:42:13.530 --> 01:42:14.730
you're schvitzing still.

2380
01:42:16.870 --> 01:42:18.469
His face just goes.

2381
01:42:18.469 --> 01:42:20.460
So just do a little dab.

2382
01:42:21.550 --> 01:42:23.580
Don't wipe, just dab.
A little rub--

2383
01:42:23.580 --> 01:42:24.830
A little dab'll do you.

2384
01:42:28.010 --> 01:42:29.620
Good night.

2385
01:42:29.620 --> 01:42:32.940
And he leaves.
(laughter)

2386
01:42:33.830 --> 01:42:35.115
A little dab'll do you.

2387
01:42:35.115 --> 01:42:36.680
(laughter)
Goddamn it.

2388
01:42:38.396 --> 01:42:40.870
You find a way to your quarters to rest for the night.

2389
01:42:41.990 --> 01:42:45.110
Sleep takes you, thoughts of early morning travel

2390
01:42:45.110 --> 01:42:47.470
towards whatever strange direction

2391
01:42:47.470 --> 01:42:49.630
and destination calls you.

2392
01:42:50.640 --> 01:42:52.190
We'll get to that when we come back from the break.

2393
01:42:52.190 --> 01:42:53.463
Oh.
Oh, shit.

2394
01:42:53.463 --> 01:42:54.990
Oh.
Ooh.

2395
01:42:54.990 --> 01:42:56.640
So.
Take some spells with you.

2396
01:42:56.640 --> 01:42:57.740
We'll return shortly.

2397
01:42:57.740 --> 01:42:59.116
Make sure you get your spells prepared,

2398
01:42:59.116 --> 01:43:00.300
those of you who do that.

2399
01:43:00.300 --> 01:43:03.100
But for the next morning, we have our giveaway

2400
01:43:06.200 --> 01:43:07.290
from our friends at Wyrmwood.

2401
01:43:07.290 --> 01:43:09.520
We have the padauk dice vault,

2402
01:43:09.520 --> 01:43:12.020
the bright orange awesome coloration.

2403
01:43:12.020 --> 01:43:13.170
It's very cool.
Ooh.

2404
01:43:13.170 --> 01:43:16.350
The keyword for tonight, for whoever wants

2405
01:43:16.350 --> 01:43:19.270
to enter the possibility of winning this lovely piece,

2406
01:43:19.270 --> 01:43:22.030
the keyword for tonight is stone, S-T-O-N-E.

2407
01:43:23.570 --> 01:43:26.480
Enter it more than one, enter it once only.

2408
01:43:26.480 --> 01:43:27.550
More than once, you'll be disqualified,

2409
01:43:27.550 --> 01:43:29.930
and once again, only folks in the U.S. and Canada,

2410
01:43:29.930 --> 01:43:33.577
yeah, I had to dig it in.
(laughter)

2411
01:43:33.577 --> 01:43:35.460
But we'll come back to you in a little bit

2412
01:43:35.460 --> 01:43:37.630
with a winner, and the rest of tonight's session.

2413
01:43:37.630 --> 01:43:41.104
So see you in a little bit.

They deserve to be as vivid and vibrant

(light adventure music)

2455
01:45:30.659 --> 01:45:32.610
(upbeat music)

2456
01:45:32.610 --> 01:45:33.980
Guess what, America?

2457
01:45:33.980 --> 01:45:35.100
Nope.
(beeping)

2458
01:45:35.100 --> 01:45:36.240
Guess what, world?

2459
01:45:36.240 --> 01:45:37.600
We're back.

2460
01:45:37.600 --> 01:45:40.310
All Work, No Play.
That's inaccurate.

2461
01:45:40.310 --> 01:45:41.689
We're not back?
We're not back.

2462
01:45:41.689 --> 01:45:42.810
(beeping)
We will be back.

2463
01:45:42.810 --> 01:45:45.636
Oh, okay.
We're coming back at, in--

2464
01:45:45.636 --> 01:45:46.820
(beeping)
We don't know when

2465
01:45:46.820 --> 01:45:47.653
we're coming back.

2466
01:45:47.653 --> 01:45:48.960
We're very close, we've been shooting stuff,

2467
01:45:48.960 --> 01:45:50.390
we've been doing all kinds of activities, like--

2468
01:45:50.390 --> 01:45:51.290
Are you looking at that camera?

2469
01:45:51.290 --> 01:45:52.445
Should I look at that camera?

2470
01:45:52.445 --> 01:45:53.900
(beeping)
Gene splicing,

2471
01:45:53.900 --> 01:45:55.942
intelligence uploads.
But like that one

2472
01:45:55.942 --> 01:45:57.070
or this one?
(beeping)

2473
01:45:57.070 --> 01:45:58.890
I'm going to just commit to this camera.

2474
01:45:58.890 --> 01:46:02.139
Anyway, catch all that and more on, oh, hi.

2475
01:46:02.139 --> 01:46:05.320 line:15%
(beeping)
Clones in the future of me.

2476
01:46:05.320 --> 01:46:06.470
I want that.

2477
01:46:06.470 --> 01:46:07.303
I want clones.

2478
01:46:07.303 --> 01:46:08.136
They won't remember you.

2479
01:46:08.136 --> 01:46:10.780
And you won't know them, and they won't be you.

2480
01:46:10.780 --> 01:46:13.377
But I just want more of me around.

2481
01:46:13.377 --> 01:46:14.210
(twinkling music)

2482
01:46:14.210 --> 01:46:17.050
This season is going to be packed with amazing stuff like--

2483
01:46:17.050 --> 01:46:18.580
Shark baiting.
Okay.

2484
01:46:18.580 --> 01:46:20.120
Shark dating.
Uh-huh.

2485
01:46:20.120 --> 01:46:21.540
Shark mating.
Oh, boy.

2486
01:46:22.510 --> 01:46:24.720
What else can we do with a shark, I wonder?

2487
01:46:24.720 --> 01:46:26.085
You'll have to wait to find out.

2488
01:46:26.085 --> 01:46:28.920
(beeping)

2489
01:46:28.920 --> 01:46:30.270 line:15%
Yeah, that's pretty good.

2490
01:46:30.270 --> 01:46:32.728 line:15%
Let's do it again.
(Sam laughing)

2491
01:46:32.728 --> 01:46:34.240
(upbeat music)

2492
01:46:34.240 --> 01:46:35.810
I'm Sam Riegel, this is Liam O'Brien,

2493
01:46:35.810 --> 01:46:37.470
we're the hosts of your favorite show,

2494
01:46:37.470 --> 01:46:39.370
All Work, No Play, which is coming back

2495
01:46:39.370 --> 01:46:42.550
to the Critical Role Twitch and YouTube channels.

2496
01:46:42.550 --> 01:46:46.014
You can catch us on twitch.tv/criticalrole

2497
01:46:46.014 --> 01:46:48.472
on some night of the week, which will be displayed

2498
01:46:48.472 --> 01:46:51.660
in front of us, starting soon,

2499
01:46:51.660 --> 01:46:54.070
and on YouTube.com/criticalrole.

2500
01:46:55.040 --> 01:46:58.640
So tune in, subscribe, like, tell your friends,

2501
01:46:58.640 --> 01:47:00.900
have a viewing party, I don't know.

2502
01:47:00.900 --> 01:47:02.441
Just watch the (buzzing) show.

2503
01:47:02.441 --> 01:47:05.024
(upbeat music)

2504
01:47:14.510 --> 01:47:16.980
Last time, on Talks Machina.

2505
01:47:16.980 --> 01:47:18.450
Sam, I have a question.

2506
01:47:18.450 --> 01:47:21.240
Are they remaking The Wire and setting it in Beverly Hills

2507
01:47:21.240 --> 01:47:23.341
about the plight of the bike messenger?

2508
01:47:23.341 --> 01:47:26.270
(Sam laughing)
Harsh.

2509
01:47:26.270 --> 01:47:28.040
What's happening here?
Guys,

2510
01:47:28.040 --> 01:47:29.630
I'm just a hip teen.

2511
01:47:29.630 --> 01:47:31.000
My wife knitted this hat.

2512
01:47:31.000 --> 01:47:32.960
She claims it takes four hours per hat,

2513
01:47:32.960 --> 01:47:35.000
but I don't know, there's a lot of hats

2514
01:47:35.000 --> 01:47:35.833
at our house right now.

2515
01:47:35.833 --> 01:47:38.710
There's probably 15, 18, 20 hats at our house right now.

2516
01:47:38.710 --> 01:47:42.290
Share a few hats.
Are you, you should see,

2517
01:47:42.290 --> 01:47:44.230
your--
(Sam laughing)

2518
01:47:44.230 --> 01:47:45.710
It's like a huge bong right now.

2519
01:47:45.710 --> 01:47:47.940
Hey, man.
Turn your head to left.

2520
01:47:47.940 --> 01:47:49.340
There you go, yeah.
I don't know

2521
01:47:49.340 --> 01:47:50.960
if we can do this on Twitch.

2522
01:47:50.960 --> 01:47:53.430 line:15%
What was it that ultimately convinced her

2523
01:47:53.430 --> 01:47:54.430 line:15%
to take the jump?

2524
01:47:54.430 --> 01:47:56.770 line:15%
Ooh.
(Sam sighing)

2525
01:47:56.770 --> 01:47:58.840 line:15%
I mean, deep down, she knew she was going to do it

2526
01:47:58.840 --> 01:48:03.840 line:15%
at some point, and she wanted a moment

2527
01:48:04.100 --> 01:48:08.440 line:15%
to think about, this is a big shift, a big change,

2528
01:48:08.440 --> 01:48:11.360 line:15%
and sometimes, you want something so long,

2529
01:48:11.360 --> 01:48:12.540 line:15%
and you're right at the cusp of it,

2530
01:48:12.540 --> 01:48:15.290 line:15%
right on the edge of getting it, and you're like, ooh, wait,

2531
01:48:15.290 --> 01:48:16.180 line:15%
do I really want this?

2532
01:48:16.180 --> 01:48:17.580
It was also looking across the table,

2533
01:48:17.580 --> 01:48:20.830
and seeing us going, "Do it, you chickenshit coward.

2534
01:48:20.830 --> 01:48:21.663
"Do it." (laughs)

2535
01:48:21.663 --> 01:48:22.580
Yeah.
Well,

2536
01:48:22.580 --> 01:48:27.260
there is a bit of Sam Riegel as a D&amp;D player,

2537
01:48:27.260 --> 01:48:28.320
I mean, you going to do stuff.

2538
01:48:28.320 --> 01:48:29.153
Yeah.
You going to do stuff.

2539
01:48:29.153 --> 01:48:30.400
You going to make decisions and go.

2540
01:48:30.400 --> 01:48:31.390
Not a play it safer.

2541
01:48:31.390 --> 01:48:35.330
Yeah, you going to make hard choices and live with them, so.

2542
01:48:35.330 --> 01:48:36.230
Yeah.
That's,

2543
01:48:37.110 --> 01:48:39.430
you know, you also going to trust that Matt Mercer's

2544
01:48:39.430 --> 01:48:41.780
going to have something on the other side for you.

2545
01:48:43.230 --> 01:48:45.170
I just figured it out.

2546
01:48:45.170 --> 01:48:48.650
You look like a homeless millionaire's son.

2547
01:48:48.650 --> 01:48:50.460
You know why?

2548
01:48:50.460 --> 01:48:53.587
If I may, I can tell why this is throwing you, Brian,

2549
01:48:53.587 --> 01:48:56.790
why this look is throwing literally everyone in the studio.

2550
01:48:56.790 --> 01:48:59.480
Oh, okay, yeah.
I look like Marisha.

2551
01:49:00.880 --> 01:49:02.270
Oh no.
People are confused,

2552
01:49:02.270 --> 01:49:04.280
because they're like, why does Marisha look

2553
01:49:04.280 --> 01:49:07.190
particularly extra gorgeous today?

2554
01:49:07.190 --> 01:49:08.990
Right, yep.
Hey, Travis?

2555
01:49:08.990 --> 01:49:10.130
Yes?

2556
01:49:10.130 --> 01:49:12.370 line:15%
This was not the first time that Caduceus mentioned

2557
01:49:12.370 --> 01:49:14.720 line:15%
the name Stone, like we talked about a minute ago,

2558
01:49:14.720 --> 01:49:17.650 line:15%
having told the story of Stone, Dust and Clay before.

2559
01:49:17.650 --> 01:49:19.410 line:15%
Is there a reason it clicked with you now,

2560
01:49:19.410 --> 01:49:22.720 line:15%
or were you just not listening before?

2561
01:49:23.600 --> 01:49:25.300 line:15%
The question on everyone's mind.

2562
01:49:25.300 --> 01:49:28.210 line:15%
No, I was not listening before, okay?

2563
01:49:28.210 --> 01:49:29.700 line:15%
I check in and out.

2564
01:49:29.700 --> 01:49:32.250 line:15%
Thursday nights for me are a time to enjoy my friends,

2565
01:49:32.250 --> 01:49:34.720 line:15%
some food--
But Marisha takes notes.

2566
01:49:34.720 --> 01:49:36.680 line:15%
She is a note taking machine.

2567
01:49:36.680 --> 01:49:37.990
Yeah.
Why would I pay attention?

2568
01:49:37.990 --> 01:49:39.040
Why would you pay attention?

2569
01:49:39.040 --> 01:49:41.150
You can't be bothered with intricate storytelling.

2570
01:49:41.150 --> 01:49:41.983
No!

2571
01:49:41.983 --> 01:49:42.816
Look, this is how I got through college.

2572
01:49:42.816 --> 01:49:45.560
I just looked at the person's paper next to mine.

2573
01:49:45.560 --> 01:49:47.904
It's rule one of improv, listen when you feel like it.

2574
01:49:47.904 --> 01:49:50.530
Yep.
(group laughing)

2575
01:49:50.530 --> 01:49:54.260
It's funny to me that your name, your last name was Stone.

2576
01:49:54.260 --> 01:49:56.390
Mm-hmm.
And you start,

2577
01:49:56.390 --> 01:49:59.570
at least in the theme song, title sequence,

2578
01:49:59.570 --> 01:50:01.640
by sinking to the bottom of the ocean.

2579
01:50:02.600 --> 01:50:03.890
Like a stone.

2580
01:50:03.890 --> 01:50:06.240
What?
Are you fucking high?

2581
01:50:06.240 --> 01:50:09.810
Yeah, this is what high people think about, yeah.

2582
01:50:10.650 --> 01:50:12.720
Have you ever looked at a $2 bill

2583
01:50:14.460 --> 01:50:17.756
on weed?
(group laughing)

2584
01:50:17.756 --> 01:50:20.240
It looks like a $22 bill.

2585
01:50:21.840 --> 01:50:22.920
Is there a guy in the bushes?

2586
01:50:22.920 --> 01:50:24.570
I don't know.

2587
01:50:24.570 --> 01:50:26.220
Red Team, go.

2588
01:50:26.220 --> 01:50:27.830
It's from Half Baked--
I know.

2589
01:50:27.830 --> 01:50:31.910
The greatest movie.
(Sam laughing)

2590
01:50:31.910 --> 01:50:33.405
Just take in the secondhand--

2591
01:50:33.405 --> 01:50:36.980
(Travis inhaling)

2592
01:50:36.980 --> 01:50:39.900 line:15%
After learning so much about Essek in the previous episode,

2593
01:50:39.900 --> 01:50:42.520 line:15%
and seeing him playing a major part in finishing

2594
01:50:42.520 --> 01:50:44.720 line:15%
that spell as well as the ritual for Nott,

2595
01:50:44.720 --> 01:50:46.790 line:15%
what is your respective character's opinion

2596
01:50:46.790 --> 01:50:47.623 line:15%
about him now?

2597
01:50:50.170 --> 01:50:51.571 line:15%
I don't trust him.
I don't trust him, either.

2598
01:50:51.571 --> 01:50:54.280 line:15%
(both laughing)
Ah, interesting.

2599
01:50:54.280 --> 01:50:55.113 line:15%
Not a bit.
No--

2600
01:50:55.113 --> 01:50:56.150 line:15%
Not a bit.
Interesting.

2601
01:50:56.150 --> 01:50:59.960 line:15%
He just went from being cold and aloof

2602
01:50:59.960 --> 01:51:02.400 line:15%
to being all of a sudden, really warm

2603
01:51:02.400 --> 01:51:04.350 line:15%
and I know when there's been time,

2604
01:51:04.350 --> 01:51:06.550 line:15%
and I know he's probably, it seems like he lives

2605
01:51:06.550 --> 01:51:09.520 line:15%
a very isolated life, and he's probably putting himself

2606
01:51:09.520 --> 01:51:10.610 line:15%
out there, and all those things,

2607
01:51:10.610 --> 01:51:14.758 line:15%
and with time, it'll show that he's being genuine.

2608
01:51:14.758 --> 01:51:15.591 line:15%
Maybe.

2609
01:51:15.591 --> 01:51:17.980 line:15%
But all of our haunches were up.

2610
01:51:17.980 --> 01:51:20.990 line:15%
We were all on level five alert.

2611
01:51:20.990 --> 01:51:23.870
We've also been giving Essek like all this,

2612
01:51:23.870 --> 01:51:25.900
we're spilling dirt left and right,

2613
01:51:26.830 --> 01:51:30.470
sharing secrets, giving him vials of shit,

2614
01:51:30.470 --> 01:51:32.205
telling him about extra dodecahedrons

2615
01:51:32.205 --> 01:51:34.370
that are out there in the word.

2616
01:51:34.370 --> 01:51:36.960
We really have opened up.

2617
01:51:36.960 --> 01:51:38.530
Yeah, we're making him look pretty good.

2618
01:51:38.530 --> 01:51:39.363
Yeah.

2619
01:51:39.363 --> 01:51:41.430
I mean, he could just be riding the coattails of,

2620
01:51:41.430 --> 01:51:43.610
you know, The Might Nein.

2621
01:51:43.610 --> 01:51:44.800
I would not be surprised, though,

2622
01:51:44.800 --> 01:51:46.830
if he stabs us in the back.

2623
01:51:46.830 --> 01:51:49.580 line:15%
Nott clearly loves Yeza and Luc,

2624
01:51:49.580 --> 01:51:53.950 line:15%
but is she still in love with Yeza?

2625
01:51:53.950 --> 01:51:55.930 line:15%
If they don't have a child,

2626
01:51:55.930 --> 01:51:57.820 line:15%
if they didn't have a child, would she be considering

2627
01:51:57.820 --> 01:51:59.080 line:15%
going back at all?

2628
01:51:59.080 --> 01:52:00.400 line:15%
I mean, I don't know.

2629
01:52:00.400 --> 01:52:02.820 line:15%
I don't know if she, she hasn't been with him

2630
01:52:02.820 --> 01:52:05.490 line:15%
for awhile, and she, like I said,

2631
01:52:05.490 --> 01:52:07.690 line:15%
she loves her new life, she loves these people.

2632
01:52:07.690 --> 01:52:10.010 line:15%
Had all these minotaurs walking around in front of her.

2633
01:52:10.010 --> 01:52:12.160 line:15%
She's seen so much now.

2634
01:52:12.160 --> 01:52:15.100 line:15%
It's hard to be with your high school sweetheart

2635
01:52:15.100 --> 01:52:19.240 line:15%
and then, be exposed to the world.

2636
01:52:19.240 --> 01:52:23.740
Yeza isn't on her mind every second of every day anymore.

2637
01:52:23.740 --> 01:52:24.740
Used to be.
Well, yeah,

2638
01:52:24.740 --> 01:52:25.873
but there's a lot going on.

2639
01:52:25.873 --> 01:52:27.110
Yeah.
A little bit.

2640
01:52:27.110 --> 01:52:27.960
A little bit.
A little bit.

2641
01:52:27.960 --> 01:52:30.650
Yeah, yeah.

2642
01:52:30.650 --> 01:52:34.990
Oh, man, I feel guilty talking about Yeza.

2643
01:52:34.990 --> 01:52:37.780
He's a fictional character, and I feel like

2644
01:52:37.780 --> 01:52:40.020
he's watching this show and he's like,

2645
01:52:40.020 --> 01:52:41.960
"What the fuck did you say about me?"

2646
01:52:41.960 --> 01:52:43.320
Uh-huh.
He's sitting there, going,

2647
01:52:43.320 --> 01:52:44.710
did you just make fun of my hat?

2648
01:52:44.710 --> 01:52:46.260
You look so cute doing, it, though.

2649
01:52:46.260 --> 01:52:48.493
You're dressed like Macaulay Cocaine.

2650
01:52:48.493 --> 01:52:51.112
(laughter)

2651
01:52:51.112 --> 01:52:53.170
Do you have any lines in the new Beverly Hills Cop,

2652
01:52:53.170 --> 01:52:54.438
or are you just robbing a Tiffany's?

2653
01:52:54.438 --> 01:52:57.188
(group laughing)

2654
01:52:59.196 --> 01:53:00.796
(laughs) Oh my god.
Guys.

2655
01:53:02.674 --> 01:53:05.140
I took a big swing with this outfit.

2656
01:53:05.140 --> 01:53:06.820
Yeah.
Might've failed.

2657
01:53:06.820 --> 01:53:09.250
I mean, we've gotten 89 minutes of material

2658
01:53:09.250 --> 01:53:11.930
out of it tonight, so I think, (laughs).

2659
01:53:12.950 --> 01:53:16.810
It's like, the components of this outfit

2660
01:53:16.810 --> 01:53:18.680
are things that I wear all the time.

2661
01:53:18.680 --> 01:53:19.630
Yeah, but--
But I think

2662
01:53:19.630 --> 01:53:23.030
when you put them together, it just doesn't feel right.

2663
01:53:23.030 --> 01:53:24.710
I commented back at the office,

2664
01:53:24.710 --> 01:53:27.020
you looked very nice.

2665
01:53:27.020 --> 01:53:27.853
I did!

2666
01:53:27.853 --> 01:53:29.410
I said those words.

2667
01:53:29.410 --> 01:53:31.160
You look like you wrote Pitch Perfect.

2668
01:53:31.160 --> 01:53:33.910
(group laughing)

2669
01:53:38.405 --> 01:53:40.853
I don't know what that means.

2670
01:53:40.853 --> 01:53:44.103 line:15%
(bright country music)

2671
01:53:46.891 --> 01:53:49.170
(cheering) Yeah!

2672
01:53:49.170 --> 01:53:50.120
We did it, yeah!

2673
01:53:50.120 --> 01:53:52.610
Sam Riegel, you just won the Superb Bowl.

2674
01:53:52.610 --> 01:53:53.670
What are you going to do now?

2675
01:53:53.670 --> 01:53:56.210
I'm subscribing to Critical Role!

2676
01:53:56.210 --> 01:53:59.137
Wonderful, and that's--
It's about perseverance,

2677
01:53:59.137 --> 01:54:01.110
like remembering to resubscribe

2678
01:54:01.110 --> 01:54:02.812
with Twitch Prime every month.

2679
01:54:02.812 --> 01:54:04.130
Yeah, woo, woo, woo.

2680
01:54:04.130 --> 01:54:05.350
So could you--
Have done it

2681
01:54:05.350 --> 01:54:06.320
without my teammates?

2682
01:54:06.320 --> 01:54:07.230
Come on, no way.

2683
01:54:07.230 --> 01:54:08.680
And they couldn't have done it

2684
01:54:08.680 --> 01:54:11.670
without the Twitch subscriptions that I gave them.

2685
01:54:11.670 --> 01:54:12.530
Right, guys?

2686
01:54:12.530 --> 01:54:13.630
Yeah.
Okay, Sam,

2687
01:54:13.630 --> 01:54:15.020
but what about--
What about,

2688
01:54:15.020 --> 01:54:17.455
what about, what about what inspires me, you mean?

2689
01:54:17.455 --> 01:54:19.800
Well, Yee-Haw Game Ranch really does.

2690
01:54:19.800 --> 01:54:23.110
I mean, watching that dehydrated piece of string cheese,

2691
01:54:23.110 --> 01:54:25.340
Brian Foster every couple of weeks,

2692
01:54:25.340 --> 01:54:27.720
really gets me pumped for the big game.

2693
01:54:27.720 --> 01:54:29.900
Sam, hold on--
(Klaxon blaring)

2694
01:54:29.900 --> 01:54:31.840
You can't believe it, you can't believe it?

2695
01:54:31.840 --> 01:54:32.780
Is that what you said?

2696
01:54:32.780 --> 01:54:35.460
Well, it's true, because every Yee-Haw VOD

2697
01:54:35.460 --> 01:54:38.610
is instantly available as soon as you subscribe.

2698
01:54:38.610 --> 01:54:39.790
It's amazing.
Sam!

2699
01:54:39.790 --> 01:54:41.070
We did it, guys.
Sam.

2700
01:54:41.070 --> 01:54:42.780
Yeah, yeah.
Sam.

2701
01:54:42.780 --> 01:54:43.613
Yeah!

2702
01:54:43.613 --> 01:54:44.680
What, sorry?
Just say,

2703
01:54:44.680 --> 01:54:46.160
"I'm going to Disneyland."

2704
01:54:46.160 --> 01:54:47.952
You're doing a commercial for Disneyland.

2705
01:54:47.952 --> 01:54:49.040
(crowd cheering)
Oh.

2706
01:54:52.960 --> 01:54:54.342
What's a Disneyland?

2707
01:54:54.342 --> 01:54:56.252 line:15%
(dramatic music)

2708
01:54:56.252 --> 01:54:59.085 line:15%
(whistle blowing)

2709
01:55:00.870 --> 01:55:02.660
I don't know, I going to be honest with you.

2710
01:55:02.660 --> 01:55:04.378
Oh.
I got hit in the head

2711
01:55:04.378 --> 01:55:07.210
pretty hard out there.
Oh my God.

2712
01:55:07.210 --> 01:55:10.592
Woo, I'm not good at sports.

2713
01:55:10.592 --> 01:55:11.425
Oh!

2714
01:55:12.558 --> 01:55:17.558
(dramatic music)
(group cheering)

2715
01:55:19.777 --> 01:55:23.360
(dramatic adventure music)

2716
02:08:04.252 --> 02:08:05.370
And welcome back.

2717
02:08:05.370 --> 02:08:08.270
So we have our winner of the Wyrmwood giveaway.

2718
02:08:08.270 --> 02:08:12.727
The winner tonight is d__man.
Yeah!

2719
02:08:12.727 --> 02:08:15.160
D__man, congratulations.

2720
02:08:15.160 --> 02:08:16.910
We'll get that to you ASAP.

2721
02:08:18.720 --> 02:08:23.720
So, Might Nein, after the evening's rest,

2722
02:08:24.010 --> 02:08:25.530
in the morning, you come to,

2723
02:08:25.530 --> 02:08:27.030
and underneath the Evening Nip,

2724
02:08:27.030 --> 02:08:31.240
within the confines of the Gentleman's private,

2725
02:08:32.620 --> 02:08:35.520
I'm going to say, organizational base,

2726
02:08:37.130 --> 02:08:38.450
the day is early and yours.

2727
02:08:38.450 --> 02:08:39.820
What would you like to do?

2728
02:08:39.820 --> 02:08:42.180
How early we talking?

2729
02:08:42.180 --> 02:08:43.460
You would know, I'd say,

2730
02:08:43.460 --> 02:08:45.160
you guys probably went to bed relatively early,

2731
02:08:45.160 --> 02:08:47.270
knowing you'd probably be traveling fairly quick,

2732
02:08:47.270 --> 02:08:49.210
so unless you want to get up any earlier,

2733
02:08:49.210 --> 02:08:51.620
I was say naturally, around probably 7:00,

2734
02:08:51.620 --> 02:08:53.660
8:00 inn the morning.
Okay.

2735
02:08:53.660 --> 02:08:56.000
Should make the most of the day, yeah, for travel?

2736
02:08:56.000 --> 02:08:57.080
Get horses, no?

2737
02:08:57.080 --> 02:08:58.280
Yeah, get some horses.

2738
02:08:59.780 --> 02:09:01.260
I suppose we could ask on the way out,

2739
02:09:01.260 --> 02:09:03.510
if your, yeah, does your father have a,

2740
02:09:03.510 --> 02:09:07.740
you know, does he have any steeds, anyone he knows?

2741
02:09:07.740 --> 02:09:08.930
That's a good question.

2742
02:09:08.930 --> 02:09:09.930
I should go ask him.

2743
02:09:10.970 --> 02:09:11.803
Okay.

2744
02:09:12.670 --> 02:09:15.670
He's, it's early, you go to his chambers.

2745
02:09:15.670 --> 02:09:17.780
Hey. (knocking)

2746
02:09:19.260 --> 02:09:22.310
Are you naked? (knocking)

2747
02:09:22.310 --> 02:09:24.230
It's your daughter.
Oh my God.

2748
02:09:24.230 --> 02:09:25.063
It's Jester.

2749
02:09:25.063 --> 02:09:26.370
Are you awake?

2750
02:09:26.370 --> 02:09:29.008
Making up for lost time.
(Beau laughing)

2751
02:09:29.008 --> 02:09:31.040
(knocking) Are you awake?

2752
02:09:31.040 --> 02:09:34.520
You hear the iron handle like (squeaking)

2753
02:09:34.520 --> 02:09:39.000
and you see a half-asleep, half-elf woman come to the door

2754
02:09:39.000 --> 02:09:41.230
and be like, hello?

2755
02:09:43.370 --> 02:09:45.550
Hello.
(laughter)

2756
02:09:45.550 --> 02:09:47.280
Is the Gentleman in here?

2757
02:09:50.030 --> 02:09:52.580
"He's indis--" you hear a voice go,

2758
02:09:52.580 --> 02:09:53.950
(as The Gentleman) "Ugh, just leave,

2759
02:09:53.950 --> 02:09:56.260
"it's-- go."

2760
02:09:56.260 --> 02:09:57.860
Leave, go.

2761
02:10:00.271 --> 02:10:01.180
Just throw them over

2762
02:10:01.180 --> 02:10:02.990
and walks out through the chamber.

2763
02:10:02.990 --> 02:10:05.610
You can see one of the other guardians through there,

2764
02:10:05.610 --> 02:10:08.090
like guides her upstairs to leave,

2765
02:10:10.241 --> 02:10:12.130
and the door's ajar, and he's like--

2766
02:10:12.130 --> 02:10:13.180
I walk in.

2767
02:10:14.650 --> 02:10:18.250
She is not that great.

2768
02:10:20.170 --> 02:10:24.300
Well, you don't know her.
(laughter)

2769
02:10:26.777 --> 02:10:28.320
What can I do for you?

2770
02:10:28.320 --> 02:10:31.930
Do you have any horses?
(laughter)

2771
02:10:34.500 --> 02:10:36.350
I take it this is for your journey?

2772
02:10:39.330 --> 02:10:41.750
I don't own horses.

2773
02:10:41.750 --> 02:10:45.240
I kept debts, and there is a livery that,

2774
02:10:48.370 --> 02:10:50.680
let me write something for you,

2775
02:10:50.680 --> 02:10:53.940
and throws his robe on, heads over to this little

2776
02:10:53.940 --> 02:10:56.130
like, end table task he has in the corner,

2777
02:10:56.130 --> 02:10:58.870
pulls out a sheet of paper, and just writes something down,

2778
02:10:58.870 --> 02:11:03.610
folds it, goes and takes one of the small candles

2779
02:11:03.610 --> 02:11:05.740
off to the side, and gets a wax seal,

2780
02:11:05.740 --> 02:11:08.160
presses it in, closes and hands it to you.

2781
02:11:09.230 --> 02:11:10.660
For this--
While he's off doing that--

2782
02:11:10.660 --> 02:11:11.950
Okay?

2783
02:11:11.950 --> 02:11:13.450
Ransack the room.

2784
02:11:13.450 --> 02:11:15.870
I'm going to get out my special paints,

2785
02:11:15.870 --> 02:11:20.150
and I'm going to paint a ruby,

2786
02:11:21.490 --> 02:11:23.050
about this big.
Whoa.

2787
02:11:23.050 --> 02:11:24.790
It's not, it doesn't turn into a real ruby,

2788
02:11:24.790 --> 02:11:26.880
but it'll be a glass ruby.

2789
02:11:26.880 --> 02:11:28.630
Okay.
When it's done.

2790
02:11:28.630 --> 02:11:30.550
It'll look like a ruby.

2791
02:11:30.550 --> 02:11:33.390
And I'm going to place it right next to his bed,

2792
02:11:34.880 --> 02:11:37.110
so he sees it when he wakes up in the morning

2793
02:11:37.110 --> 02:11:38.410
and when he goes to sleep.

2794
02:11:41.530 --> 02:11:42.363
Okay.

2795
02:11:43.981 --> 02:11:45.140
Make a stealth check for me.

2796
02:11:45.140 --> 02:11:47.000
Unless, yeah, this would you--

2797
02:11:47.000 --> 02:11:49.311
As a child of divorce, I'm so into this right now.

2798
02:11:49.311 --> 02:11:51.880
(laughter)

2799
02:11:51.880 --> 02:11:54.150
Ooh, hee, ooh, 22!

2800
02:11:55.620 --> 02:11:56.453
Okay.

2801
02:11:57.570 --> 02:11:58.740
He seems engrossed in his letter,

2802
02:11:58.740 --> 02:12:01.150
and does not notice you quickly, deftly,

2803
02:12:01.150 --> 02:12:05.050
artistically create this ruby, and place it.

2804
02:12:06.500 --> 02:12:09.030
By the time he finishes the envelope, and turns around,

2805
02:12:09.030 --> 02:12:10.480
you're already right back where you started,

2806
02:12:10.480 --> 02:12:12.110
and it goes right into your grasp.

2807
02:12:12.110 --> 02:12:12.943
Thank you.

2808
02:12:12.943 --> 02:12:14.680
Look for a Kiefer Stables.

2809
02:12:14.680 --> 02:12:16.870
Kiefer is the proprietor.

2810
02:12:16.870 --> 02:12:18.520
Just hand him the letter, and tell him

2811
02:12:18.520 --> 02:12:19.880
how many horses you need.

2812
02:12:19.880 --> 02:12:20.830
He should take care of it.

2813
02:12:20.830 --> 02:12:21.663
Thank you so much.

2814
02:12:21.663 --> 02:12:24.840
It's in the south of the, south of the city?

2815
02:12:25.820 --> 02:12:26.653
Hmm?

2816
02:12:26.653 --> 02:12:29.150
Is it the stables in the south of the city?

2817
02:12:29.150 --> 02:12:31.420
This would be in the western side.

2818
02:12:31.420 --> 02:12:34.060
Oh, so it would not be Kiefer of the southern lands.

2819
02:12:34.060 --> 02:12:36.595
(groaning)

2820
02:12:36.595 --> 02:12:38.066
No, no.
Wow.

2821
02:12:38.066 --> 02:12:39.390
Oh, boy.
I'll go now.

2822
02:12:40.770 --> 02:12:42.320
No, please don't.

2823
02:12:43.820 --> 02:12:46.170
Thank you for letting us stay here last night.

2824
02:12:46.170 --> 02:12:47.003
Yes.

2825
02:12:48.435 --> 02:12:50.350
Happy to provide when in need.

2826
02:12:51.350 --> 02:12:54.940
Thank you for, you know, being nice to me,

2827
02:12:54.940 --> 02:12:56.580
and being nice to my friends and stuff,

2828
02:12:56.580 --> 02:12:58.450
and it's really good to see you again,

2829
02:12:58.450 --> 02:13:00.590
and I hug him, I give him a kiss on the cheek.

2830
02:13:01.890 --> 02:13:03.560
It's good to see you as well, Jester.

2831
02:13:03.560 --> 02:13:07.700
Call Mom whenever, you know,

2832
02:13:07.700 --> 02:13:10.450
just remember she is, you know, she's there,

2833
02:13:10.450 --> 02:13:13.690
she's really pretty, and she's really great and talented.

2834
02:13:13.690 --> 02:13:14.846
Okay, bye.

2835
02:13:14.846 --> 02:13:17.010
(laughs) Door closes.

2836
02:13:19.280 --> 02:13:20.520
Too little ruby.

2837
02:13:20.520 --> 02:13:23.320
I know, I should've left a little sapphire next to it.

2838
02:13:25.110 --> 02:13:25.943
All right.

2839
02:13:27.108 --> 02:13:27.941
How did it go?

2840
02:13:27.941 --> 02:13:29.200
We have horses?
We got, well,

2841
02:13:29.200 --> 02:13:30.610
he's, we maybe have horses.

2842
02:13:30.610 --> 02:13:34.110
We're to the Kiefer Stables,

2843
02:13:34.110 --> 02:13:37.320
and they owe Dad a debt or something,

2844
02:13:37.320 --> 02:13:39.040
and they'll give us some horses or something.

2845
02:13:39.040 --> 02:13:41.290
Your dad is hooking us up.

2846
02:13:41.290 --> 02:13:43.800
I know!
Free lodging, free food,

2847
02:13:43.800 --> 02:13:46.800
free booze, free horses.
Yeah.

2848
02:13:46.800 --> 02:13:49.395
I mean, he loves the shit out of you.

2849
02:13:49.395 --> 02:13:50.560
Yeah.

2850
02:13:50.560 --> 02:13:51.393
Do we have to go--

2851
02:13:51.393 --> 02:13:52.880
I think he's making up--
And rough anyone up?

2852
02:13:52.880 --> 02:13:55.260
For lost time, you know what I mean?

2853
02:13:55.260 --> 02:13:57.010
Yeah, of course.

2854
02:13:57.010 --> 02:13:57.843
Do we have to what?

2855
02:13:57.843 --> 02:13:58.750
Do we have to rough anybody up?

2856
02:13:58.750 --> 02:14:00.270
Do we have to be like intimidating for your dad?

2857
02:14:00.270 --> 02:14:01.103
I don't think so.

2858
02:14:01.103 --> 02:14:02.070
I just have to give him this piece of paper.

2859
02:14:02.070 --> 02:14:03.790
Maybe it says somebody's going to kill them

2860
02:14:03.790 --> 02:14:07.130
if they don't give them what we need, you know?

2861
02:14:07.130 --> 02:14:07.963
Cool.
All right, now,

2862
02:14:07.963 --> 02:14:10.510
let's walk in.
Follow your lead, yeah.

2863
02:14:10.510 --> 02:14:12.210
You don't want to read it?

2864
02:14:12.210 --> 02:14:14.850
It's sealed--
There's the wax in it.

2865
02:14:14.850 --> 02:14:15.890
Is there a wax thing on it?

2866
02:14:15.890 --> 02:14:16.723
Yes.

2867
02:14:16.723 --> 02:14:18.720
Beau's the queen of mail fraud over here.

2868
02:14:18.720 --> 02:14:19.740
She could probably do it.

2869
02:14:19.740 --> 02:14:21.740
Pop that and reseal it.

2870
02:14:21.740 --> 02:14:23.801
Spoilers, it says, "Give these people some horses."

2871
02:14:23.801 --> 02:14:25.860
(Nott laughing)
(laughs) Yeah, right.

2872
02:14:25.860 --> 02:14:27.440
Let's go get these fucking horses.

2873
02:14:27.440 --> 02:14:29.156
Kill these people, leave their bodies in a ditch.

2874
02:14:29.156 --> 02:14:30.921
(laughter)

2875
02:14:30.921 --> 02:14:33.180
Let's go full Hamlet here.
(laughter)

2876
02:14:33.180 --> 02:14:34.130
What's the stamp?

2877
02:14:36.060 --> 02:14:41.060
The stamp is just a simple, like it's just a simple G,

2878
02:14:41.650 --> 02:14:45.260
but it's a very meticulously carved G,

2879
02:14:45.260 --> 02:14:48.914
to almost look like a, for lack of a better term,

2880
02:14:48.914 --> 02:14:51.530
a detailed, intricate lock.

2881
02:14:52.420 --> 02:14:53.760
There's not like a lot of filagree around it,

2882
02:14:53.760 --> 02:14:56.400
but it has a--
It's cool.

2883
02:15:00.300 --> 02:15:01.133
Yes.

2884
02:15:03.600 --> 02:15:04.550
With my background--

2885
02:15:04.550 --> 02:15:06.200
Oh Jesus.
Oh, sorry.

2886
02:15:06.200 --> 02:15:07.540
Yes?
Goddamn horses.

2887
02:15:07.540 --> 02:15:10.760
If I like-- I want to lift it, and I want to peel it,

2888
02:15:10.760 --> 02:15:13.230
and I want to start seeing how hard it might be

2889
02:15:13.230 --> 02:15:15.970
to separate the wax with a knife.

2890
02:15:15.970 --> 02:15:20.260
I mean, it's going to be hard, but it's probably doable.

2891
02:15:20.260 --> 02:15:21.270
I hold it up to the light.

2892
02:15:21.270 --> 02:15:22.160
Can I see through it?

2893
02:15:22.160 --> 02:15:23.310
Can I read a little bit?

2894
02:15:23.310 --> 02:15:24.390
This is Act II.

2895
02:15:24.390 --> 02:15:27.141
Make a perception check.
(Beau laughing)

2896
02:15:27.141 --> 02:15:31.210
(dice clattering)
Oh, that was almost good.

2897
02:15:31.210 --> 02:15:32.940
Eight.
Eight, mm, unfortunately,

2898
02:15:32.940 --> 02:15:34.510
it's very, very solid material.

2899
02:15:36.990 --> 02:15:38.540
It's all right, Beau.

2900
02:15:38.540 --> 02:15:39.890
We'll find out soon enough.

2901
02:15:41.040 --> 02:15:43.090
We can just be there when they read it.

2902
02:15:44.310 --> 02:15:48.310
We make our way to the Kiefer Stables.

2903
02:15:48.310 --> 02:15:49.640
All right.

2904
02:15:49.640 --> 02:15:50.767
Heading westward through Zadash,

2905
02:15:50.767 --> 02:15:53.370
you make your way to the West, asking a few questions,

2906
02:15:53.370 --> 02:15:54.203
keeping any eye out,

2907
02:15:54.203 --> 02:15:55.990
you haven't quite--
Asking questions?

2908
02:15:55.990 --> 02:15:56.823
Yes.

2909
02:15:56.823 --> 02:16:00.440
You haven't spent a lot of time on this far end of the city.

2910
02:16:00.440 --> 02:16:01.700
Ooh.
Necessarily.

2911
02:16:01.700 --> 02:16:03.730
So it takes a little bit to find out

2912
02:16:03.730 --> 02:16:04.820
where the Kiefer Stables are,

2913
02:16:04.820 --> 02:16:09.460
but upon arriving, they're not small, they're not big.

2914
02:16:09.460 --> 02:16:11.680
They're just a standard medium sized livery.

2915
02:16:12.630 --> 02:16:15.120
There are two individuals that are in the process

2916
02:16:15.120 --> 02:16:20.120
of providing feed for the, you see they have mostly horses.

2917
02:16:21.500 --> 02:16:24.630
There are a couple of beasts of burden there, as well,

2918
02:16:24.630 --> 02:16:28.000
look like they also sell those types of creatures,

2919
02:16:28.000 --> 02:16:31.060
two big ox-looking beasts.

2920
02:16:32.380 --> 02:16:36.822
But you enter the front, and there is one man you see,

2921
02:16:36.822 --> 02:16:40.780
probably in his late 50s, early 60s or so,

2922
02:16:40.780 --> 02:16:45.780
extremely curly, poof red hair around the back and sides

2923
02:16:45.870 --> 02:16:49.860
of a bald head, 5 o'clock shadow

2924
02:16:49.860 --> 02:16:52.570
all across his chin, with a bit of a double chin,

2925
02:16:53.990 --> 02:16:56.850
just in the process of organizing stuff for the day,

2926
02:16:56.850 --> 02:16:59.450
putting tools in the walls, and setting things up

2927
02:16:59.450 --> 02:17:00.300
this early in morning.

2928
02:17:00.300 --> 02:17:02.640
As soon as you walk in, he turns around.

2929
02:17:02.640 --> 02:17:03.790
Oh, hello.

2930
02:17:03.790 --> 02:17:07.310
Is, sure, we're open.

2931
02:17:07.310 --> 02:17:09.540
How can I help you?
Is this all right?

2932
02:17:09.540 --> 02:17:10.960
I know it's early.

2933
02:17:10.960 --> 02:17:13.170
It's, you've got here in time.

2934
02:17:13.170 --> 02:17:14.210
What can I do for you?

2935
02:17:14.210 --> 02:17:15.590
Do you run this place?

2936
02:17:15.590 --> 02:17:16.750
I am Kiefer, yes.

2937
02:17:18.500 --> 02:17:20.200
I've got a note for you, Kiefer.

2938
02:17:21.350 --> 02:17:22.183
Thank you.

2939
02:17:23.030 --> 02:17:25.150
It's not as ominous as it seems.

2940
02:17:25.150 --> 02:17:26.730
Or maybe it is.

2941
02:17:26.730 --> 02:17:27.880
Or maybe it is.

2942
02:17:27.880 --> 02:17:29.450
All right, mm-hmm.

2943
02:17:35.690 --> 02:17:36.640
Excuse me a moment.

2944
02:17:37.580 --> 02:17:39.930
And he walks over to the side of a desk,

2945
02:17:39.930 --> 02:17:41.970
and pulls up a little, you know, knife,

2946
02:17:41.970 --> 02:17:43.480
and you can see him, he's,

2947
02:17:43.480 --> 02:17:44.830
his movements are a bit erratic and quick,

2948
02:17:44.830 --> 02:17:46.350
and he, shh, shh, opens it.

2949
02:17:52.440 --> 02:17:53.290
What do you need?

2950
02:17:54.360 --> 02:17:55.304
Wow.

2951
02:17:55.304 --> 02:17:57.440
I'm going to make him an offer he can't refuse.

2952
02:17:57.440 --> 02:18:00.840
We need some, oh, Caleb, do you want to take care of this?

2953
02:18:00.840 --> 02:18:02.550
I, this is your father's.

2954
02:18:02.550 --> 02:18:04.530
Oh, I mean, but we need some horses.

2955
02:18:04.530 --> 02:18:05.680
How many?

2956
02:18:05.680 --> 02:18:07.040
Yeah, for all of us.
Yeah.

2957
02:18:07.040 --> 02:18:08.990
One each--
Well, I don't--

2958
02:18:08.990 --> 02:18:10.490
One each!
Take your pick.

2959
02:18:10.490 --> 02:18:12.130
Seven horses, yours.

2960
02:18:12.130 --> 02:18:13.530
I don't need a horse--

2961
02:18:13.530 --> 02:18:16.000
I'm sure things go well with us--

2962
02:18:16.000 --> 02:18:17.470
I'd rather someone else drive.

2963
02:18:17.470 --> 02:18:19.620
Take the fucking horse.
I can only.

2964
02:18:19.620 --> 02:18:20.830
You're only going to need the horses

2965
02:18:20.830 --> 02:18:22.200
for this one leg of the journey.

2966
02:18:22.200 --> 02:18:23.450
I'm sure we can--
How do we get them

2967
02:18:23.450 --> 02:18:24.830
back to you when we're done with them?

2968
02:18:24.830 --> 02:18:26.110
Oh, they are yours to keep.

2969
02:18:26.110 --> 02:18:27.670
What, I rent--
If you would like.

2970
02:18:27.670 --> 02:18:28.886
How generous.
Thank you.

2971
02:18:28.886 --> 02:18:30.120
Wow.

2972
02:18:32.090 --> 02:18:33.360
Thank you, Kiefer.

2973
02:18:33.360 --> 02:18:34.310
You're welcome.

2974
02:18:34.310 --> 02:18:35.790
We will have them prepared for you.

2975
02:18:35.790 --> 02:18:37.180
Just tell them which ones you want,

2976
02:18:37.180 --> 02:18:39.020
and we'll have them outfitted, saddles--

2977
02:18:39.020 --> 02:18:42.060
What did the letter say?
Feed.

2978
02:18:42.060 --> 02:18:44.300
It's, (sighing)

2979
02:18:47.475 --> 02:18:49.130
(laughter)
I will provide.

2980
02:18:49.130 --> 02:18:50.410
I want to know so bad.

2981
02:18:51.680 --> 02:18:53.732
He's basically saying, like we will provide feed

2982
02:18:53.732 --> 02:18:54.893
and everything you require.

2983
02:18:54.893 --> 02:18:55.726
Wow.

2984
02:18:55.726 --> 02:18:56.630
Will wrote you up.
Holy shit.

2985
02:18:56.630 --> 02:18:57.463
Whatever you need.

2986
02:18:57.463 --> 02:18:59.310
All right.
We'll meet you outside then.

2987
02:18:59.310 --> 02:19:00.520
Thank you.
Of course.

2988
02:19:00.520 --> 02:19:01.353
So much.

2989
02:19:01.353 --> 02:19:02.870
Sometimes, it is just that easy.

2990
02:19:02.870 --> 02:19:03.703
Wow.

2991
02:19:03.703 --> 02:19:06.270
I go up to him, I'll give you 50 gold for that letter.

2992
02:19:06.270 --> 02:19:08.240
Jesus.
Who are you people?

2993
02:19:08.240 --> 02:19:10.550
I'll take it with me, it'll be gone.

2994
02:19:10.550 --> 02:19:12.290
50 gold.

2995
02:19:12.290 --> 02:19:13.870
You'll never see it again.

2996
02:19:16.296 --> 02:19:17.370
(laughter)

2997
02:19:17.370 --> 02:19:18.950
How much would the horses have cost?

2998
02:19:18.950 --> 02:19:20.996
50 gold.
(laughter)

2999
02:19:20.996 --> 02:19:22.970
I want to know what it is.

3000
02:19:22.970 --> 02:19:24.308
No, the horses are a little pricier.

3001
02:19:24.308 --> 02:19:25.420
Oh, okay.

3002
02:19:25.420 --> 02:19:26.840
She's got his head right there.

3003
02:19:26.840 --> 02:19:28.010
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

3004
02:19:29.020 --> 02:19:30.270
Okay.

3005
02:19:30.270 --> 02:19:31.260
Okay, you look at the letter.

3006
02:19:31.260 --> 02:19:33.400
Wow.
I'll wait 'til we leave.

3007
02:19:33.400 --> 02:19:34.233
Okay.

3008
02:19:34.233 --> 02:19:35.160
I don't want to embarrass some man.

3009
02:19:35.160 --> 02:19:37.650
I'm a tactful woman.
Of course you are.

3010
02:19:37.650 --> 02:19:42.100
I have about, say, 18 or so horses

3011
02:19:42.100 --> 02:19:43.550
that are currently kept here.

3012
02:19:44.719 --> 02:19:46.530
They're, some of them are healthier,

3013
02:19:46.530 --> 02:19:48.180
some are older, some are younger,

3014
02:19:48.180 --> 02:19:50.270
there are a number to pick from that all function

3015
02:19:50.270 --> 02:19:51.103
and work well.

3016
02:19:51.103 --> 02:19:53.200
You find ones that befit your personalities,

3017
02:19:53.200 --> 02:19:54.650
and have them outfitted.

3018
02:19:54.650 --> 02:19:56.700
A week's worth of feed is provided.

3019
02:19:56.700 --> 02:19:57.890
Wow.
Within saddle bags

3020
02:19:57.890 --> 02:19:59.034
and other elements there,

3021
02:19:59.034 --> 02:20:00.800
weighing them for a longer journey,

3022
02:20:00.800 --> 02:20:03.140
uncertain of how long you'll be going.

3023
02:20:03.140 --> 02:20:06.150
You're given the full package.

3024
02:20:06.150 --> 02:20:08.258
My horse keeps chasing Fjord's horse.

3025
02:20:08.258 --> 02:20:11.175
(laughter)

3026
02:20:13.567 --> 02:20:15.041
That's a joke that no one will get.

3027
02:20:15.041 --> 02:20:16.640
(laughter)

3028
02:20:16.640 --> 02:20:18.710
I'm not saying, named caddy.

3029
02:20:18.710 --> 02:20:23.710
There you go.
Yeah, yeah.

3030
02:20:24.299 --> 02:20:28.680
God dabbit.
(laughter)

3031
02:20:28.680 --> 02:20:29.677
So, um--
Listen to Sam.

3032
02:20:29.677 --> 02:20:32.600
Listen to me.
(laughter)

3033
02:20:32.600 --> 02:20:34.640
You have your horses, you have your materials.

3034
02:20:34.640 --> 02:20:35.980
The day is still young.

3035
02:20:35.980 --> 02:20:38.290
No problems, no questions.

3036
02:20:38.290 --> 02:20:41.640
You are free to go and make your way westward.

3037
02:20:41.640 --> 02:20:44.470
That went really, really well.

3038
02:20:44.470 --> 02:20:46.640
Are we outside?
Terrifyingly smoothly.

3039
02:20:46.640 --> 02:20:47.473
Yeah, you're outside.

3040
02:20:47.473 --> 02:20:48.550
You're on horseback.

3041
02:20:48.550 --> 02:20:51.030
You're making your way towards the outer perimeter

3042
02:20:51.030 --> 02:20:52.650
of the city walls.

3043
02:20:52.650 --> 02:20:54.120
Cool.
I pop the seal,

3044
02:20:54.120 --> 02:20:56.920
and I try really hard, like I take a little--

3045
02:20:56.920 --> 02:20:58.820
It's already open.
It's super easy.

3046
02:20:58.820 --> 02:20:59.653
It's already opened.

3047
02:20:59.653 --> 02:21:01.500
Oh right.
(Fjord laughing)

3048
02:21:01.500 --> 02:21:02.750
Is the seal broken?

3049
02:21:02.750 --> 02:21:04.030
Did he crack it?

3050
02:21:04.030 --> 02:21:06.380
He read the letter, so he had to open it, yes.

3051
02:21:06.380 --> 02:21:08.020
The wax is broken.
Because sometimes you,

3052
02:21:08.020 --> 02:21:10.260
whatever, okay, okay, yeah.

3053
02:21:10.260 --> 02:21:11.620
What's in the letter?

3054
02:21:11.620 --> 02:21:14.690
All it says is--
Oh, come on.

3055
02:21:15.690 --> 02:21:17.840
Give me something good.
(Nott laughing)

3056
02:21:17.840 --> 02:21:22.840
All it says is, "Give them many gifts,

3057
02:21:22.980 --> 02:21:25.940
"whatever they ask, Gentleman."

3058
02:21:28.360 --> 02:21:29.214
(Beau sighing)

3059
02:21:29.214 --> 02:21:30.400
Could have asked for anything.

3060
02:21:30.400 --> 02:21:31.233
There it is,

3061
02:21:31.233 --> 02:21:32.710
the secret of the Luxon unmasked.

3062
02:21:32.710 --> 02:21:34.690
Yeah.
As he said, though,

3063
02:21:34.690 --> 02:21:35.740
got his handwriting, though.

3064
02:21:35.740 --> 02:21:36.610
That's good.

3065
02:21:36.610 --> 02:21:38.250
Maybe we could,

3066
02:21:38.250 --> 02:21:40.700
maybe you could learn it, forge something.

3067
02:21:40.700 --> 02:21:42.270
Send a letter to my mom, saying,

3068
02:21:42.270 --> 02:21:43.450
"Oh my gosh, I miss you so much?"

3069
02:21:43.450 --> 02:21:45.240
We could Parent Trap them!

3070
02:21:45.240 --> 02:21:46.690
Oh, I was worried that we were going to do that.

3071
02:21:46.690 --> 02:21:47.690
You could Parent Trap them.

3072
02:21:47.690 --> 02:21:50.030
We got The Parent Trap.
(crying) Oh no.

3073
02:21:50.030 --> 02:21:53.070
Meet me here, and because I still love you,

3074
02:21:53.070 --> 02:21:55.850
and then, you send a letter to him,

3075
02:21:55.850 --> 02:21:57.630
because you probably know your mom's handwriting.

3076
02:21:57.630 --> 02:21:58.660
Yeah, obviously.

3077
02:21:58.660 --> 02:22:01.710
I want to meet you at this place, at this time.

3078
02:22:01.710 --> 02:22:02.543
Oh my gosh.

3079
02:22:02.543 --> 02:22:03.460
And we'll be waiting in the bushes.

3080
02:22:03.460 --> 02:22:05.580
Then we can watch them reunite.

3081
02:22:05.580 --> 02:22:08.170
Can we get Patty Duke on to play the ruby,

3082
02:22:08.170 --> 02:22:09.040
I'll stop, okay.

3083
02:22:09.040 --> 02:22:10.320
We're going to Parent Trap your parents.

3084
02:22:10.320 --> 02:22:11.153
I can't wait.

3085
02:22:12.330 --> 02:22:13.530
It's going to be so great, you guys.

3086
02:22:13.530 --> 02:22:14.580
Start planning, man.

3087
02:22:14.580 --> 02:22:16.460
Do it at Traveler Con.

3088
02:22:16.460 --> 02:22:18.330
You'll have the Traveler there to guide you.

3089
02:22:18.330 --> 02:22:20.100
Kill both your parents, it's cool.

3090
02:22:20.100 --> 02:22:21.060
It's true.

3091
02:22:21.060 --> 02:22:22.510
I wonder if he would help me.

3092
02:22:23.700 --> 02:22:25.030
This is a noble pursuit.

3093
02:22:25.030 --> 02:22:27.910
Only works with identical twin.

3094
02:22:27.910 --> 02:22:28.960
I bet he would.

3095
02:22:28.960 --> 02:22:31.340
This seems like exactly what he does.

3096
02:22:31.340 --> 02:22:33.150
He plays pranks and tricks of people,

3097
02:22:33.150 --> 02:22:34.600
for a greater good.

3098
02:22:34.600 --> 02:22:36.170
This is a trick that is for the greater good.

3099
02:22:36.170 --> 02:22:38.320
What could go wrong?
(Caduceus snorting)

3100
02:22:38.320 --> 02:22:41.750
I feel like we need to do this.

3101
02:22:41.750 --> 02:22:43.550
Is this one of those ones that we intervene on,

3102
02:22:43.550 --> 02:22:44.383
or we just let it go?

3103
02:22:44.383 --> 02:22:45.920
I'm not really sure at this point.

3104
02:22:45.920 --> 02:22:47.700
All right.
Yeah.

3105
02:22:47.700 --> 02:22:50.980
Oh, are we going?
(laughter)

3106
02:22:52.510 --> 02:22:53.343
Whoa.

3107
02:22:55.420 --> 02:22:56.780
And wipe.

3108
02:22:56.780 --> 02:22:57.650
Scene transition.

3109
02:22:59.381 --> 02:23:01.980
Oh my God.
Turn, turn.

3110
02:23:03.732 --> 02:23:05.960
Use your foot, use your outside foot.

3111
02:23:06.880 --> 02:23:10.060
Parent Trap montage starts.

3112
02:23:10.060 --> 02:23:11.920
And did we get one per Mighty Nein?

3113
02:23:11.920 --> 02:23:14.560
Are you riding a horse for the first time ever solo?

3114
02:23:14.560 --> 02:23:17.210
I think so, and yep, unless it goes poorly.

3115
02:23:17.210 --> 02:23:18.043
Yeah, I'd like to go ahead--

3116
02:23:18.043 --> 02:23:18.876
It's a pony.
Pony?

3117
02:23:18.876 --> 02:23:19.709
Yeah.
I will say this.

3118
02:23:19.709 --> 02:23:21.760
Because this is your first time handling a horse--

3119
02:23:21.760 --> 02:23:22.593
Yes!

3120
02:23:22.593 --> 02:23:24.280
Make an animal handling check for me.

3121
02:23:24.280 --> 02:23:26.237
Oh no.
That's a two plus one.

3122
02:23:26.237 --> 02:23:29.350
(laughter)

3123
02:23:29.350 --> 02:23:32.890
I will say your pace is slightly lessened.

3124
02:23:32.890 --> 02:23:36.550
For the first hour or so that you're trying to get

3125
02:23:36.550 --> 02:23:38.560
Nott's horse to do anything correctly.

3126
02:23:38.560 --> 02:23:40.760
So familiar.
Yeah, yeah.

3127
02:23:40.760 --> 02:23:43.720
Checks out.
Sam, where are you going?

3128
02:23:43.720 --> 02:23:45.222
Nott's horse just takes off in a gallop.

3129
02:23:45.222 --> 02:23:49.870
(laughs) East.
(laughter)

3130
02:23:49.870 --> 02:23:52.810
This is. (laughs)
(laughter)

3131
02:23:52.810 --> 02:23:53.820
Art imitating life.

3132
02:23:57.019 --> 02:24:00.970
But nevertheless, eventually, righting yourselves

3133
02:24:00.970 --> 02:24:04.080
and finding the path, you continue westward.

3134
02:24:05.240 --> 02:24:08.380
Eventually, to the, I believe it's the Amber Crossroads,

3135
02:24:08.380 --> 02:24:11.980
and then, continuing westward towards the Truscan Vale

3136
02:24:11.980 --> 02:24:14.030
on the western side of the Marrow Valley.

3137
02:24:16.050 --> 02:24:21.050
At a fast pace on horseback, it's 36 miles a day.

3138
02:24:21.940 --> 02:24:25.390
I'll say it'll take you about two and a half, three days.

3139
02:24:25.390 --> 02:24:27.680
You can try and push your horses further if you want,

3140
02:24:27.680 --> 02:24:29.980
but you risk exhaustion both for yourselves and the horses.

3141
02:24:29.980 --> 02:24:31.610
Yeah.
We'll just do it.

3142
02:24:31.610 --> 02:24:33.120
Yeah, we're not dying for time.

3143
02:24:33.120 --> 02:24:36.290
No, we're good.
Okay.

3144
02:24:37.480 --> 02:24:39.550
First day of travels, relatively uneventful.

3145
02:24:39.550 --> 02:24:41.693
This side of the Vale, or this side of the Empire

3146
02:24:41.693 --> 02:24:46.693
is not extremely eventful, especially in the open fields,

3147
02:24:46.770 --> 02:24:48.840
in comparison to some of the places you've been,

3148
02:24:48.840 --> 02:24:49.990
especially after going to Xhorhas,

3149
02:24:49.990 --> 02:24:52.310
and traveling that dangerous landscape,

3150
02:24:52.310 --> 02:24:55.860
the return to the Marrow Valley and these open roads

3151
02:24:55.860 --> 02:24:59.030
and green, rolling grass and you know, mild hills

3152
02:24:59.030 --> 02:25:02.130
in the distance with the framing of the valley mountains

3153
02:25:02.130 --> 02:25:04.630
on each side, it's almost comfortable and picturesque

3154
02:25:04.630 --> 02:25:08.090
to be in a place where you're not completely

3155
02:25:08.090 --> 02:25:10.780
left in the unknown of what's trying to hunt or eat you.

3156
02:25:12.880 --> 02:25:16.700
As the night grows darker, around,

3157
02:25:16.700 --> 02:25:17.870
look at the map one more time.

3158
02:25:17.870 --> 02:25:19.020
You have the--
Sure.

3159
02:25:20.640 --> 02:25:21.473
The region here.

3160
02:25:21.473 --> 02:25:23.260
I'm keeping my eyes open for anything unusual

3161
02:25:23.260 --> 02:25:24.200
along the route, as well.

3162
02:25:24.200 --> 02:25:28.270
Okay, so I'd say you,

3163
02:25:30.330 --> 02:25:34.150
yeah, so westward,

3164
02:25:35.520 --> 02:25:38.210
are you heading along the Bromkiln Byway,

3165
02:25:38.210 --> 02:25:39.560
Bromkiln Byway, or are you just cutting

3166
02:25:39.560 --> 02:25:40.760
right across the valley?

3167
02:25:42.627 --> 02:25:44.750
Well, I could cast my 6th level spell.

3168
02:25:44.750 --> 02:25:47.020
Which is what?
Find the path.

3169
02:25:47.020 --> 02:25:48.620
That's a straight line, right?

3170
02:25:49.770 --> 02:25:52.350
I don't know, it finds the shortest route, but,

3171
02:25:55.010 --> 02:25:56.550
that might take us, you know.

3172
02:25:56.550 --> 02:25:58.390
It's the worst spell ever, by the way.

3173
02:25:58.390 --> 02:25:59.540
It's a pretty shitty spell.

3174
02:25:59.540 --> 02:26:02.690
Completely waste.
It's basically waste.

3175
02:26:02.690 --> 02:26:05.780
This finds the shortest, most direct physical route

3176
02:26:05.780 --> 02:26:07.570
to a specific--
It's a line.

3177
02:26:07.570 --> 02:26:10.100
Location.
Jesus--

3178
02:26:10.100 --> 02:26:12.810
Do you want to cast it?
I mean, should I cast it?

3179
02:26:12.810 --> 02:26:14.470
Sure.
Hey, you know what?

3180
02:26:14.470 --> 02:26:16.920
This is a spell we're never going to cast.

3181
02:26:16.920 --> 02:26:17.970
We might as well cast it.

3182
02:26:17.970 --> 02:26:19.930
It's so highly situation, yeah.

3183
02:26:19.930 --> 02:26:23.320
It's super useful, in the very rare circumstances

3184
02:26:23.320 --> 02:26:25.040
where it is useful.

3185
02:26:25.040 --> 02:26:26.830
Otherwise, it's kind of.
Yeah.

3186
02:26:26.830 --> 02:26:28.430
So let's see what happens.
Do it.

3187
02:26:28.430 --> 02:26:29.263
Do it.
Yeah, sure.

3188
02:26:29.263 --> 02:26:31.450
Wow, I agree with Taliesin.

3189
02:26:32.530 --> 02:26:36.240
It's either this or in a maze in the Abyss.

3190
02:26:37.080 --> 02:26:37.913
Go for it.

3191
02:26:37.913 --> 02:26:38.760
I say we go.
I mean you could--

3192
02:26:38.760 --> 02:26:39.760
Oh, true.
Yeah.

3193
02:26:41.740 --> 02:26:42.590
All right.

3194
02:26:42.590 --> 02:26:46.180
So as you shrug, as part of the casting spell,

3195
02:26:46.180 --> 02:26:48.960
it's part of the somatic components of it,

3196
02:26:51.150 --> 02:26:54.950
you focus and the wind blows by,

3197
02:26:54.950 --> 02:26:57.490
you can see the waves of grass and grain

3198
02:26:57.490 --> 02:26:58.691
across the field shift with it,

3199
02:26:58.691 --> 02:27:02.520
and as it does, you see a portion of the grass

3200
02:27:02.520 --> 02:27:04.880
seems to almost grow brighter and taller

3201
02:27:04.880 --> 02:27:06.930
than the rest rapidly.
Wow.

3202
02:27:06.930 --> 02:27:09.550
And it continues in a direct line,

3203
02:27:09.550 --> 02:27:11.300
in a direction slightly north

3204
02:27:11.300 --> 02:27:12.510
of where you were already heading,

3205
02:27:12.510 --> 02:27:14.970
but that direction, you can see it carrying

3206
02:27:14.970 --> 02:27:16.680
that way.
We go that way?

3207
02:27:16.680 --> 02:27:18.870
That would be fun.
All right, let's go.

3208
02:27:18.870 --> 02:27:19.703
All right.

3209
02:27:20.590 --> 02:27:21.660
It is getting dark,

3210
02:27:21.660 --> 02:27:24.322
if you guys want to set camp or push through.

3211
02:27:24.322 --> 02:27:25.650
Uh.
Oh.

3212
02:27:25.650 --> 02:27:29.745
Because you're now diverging from the Byway to do this, so.

3213
02:27:29.745 --> 02:27:34.230
Well, you just began it, so follow it a little longer.

3214
02:27:34.230 --> 02:27:36.060
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

3215
02:27:37.540 --> 02:27:40.610
It is for a day, but I have concentrate on it.

3216
02:27:40.610 --> 02:27:43.290
Do I have to, can I sleep when I concentrate?

3217
02:27:43.290 --> 02:27:45.240
Generally, no.
Yeah.

3218
02:27:45.240 --> 02:27:47.850
I should've cast this in the morning, but--

3219
02:27:47.850 --> 02:27:48.683
That's all right.

3220
02:27:48.683 --> 02:27:49.620
We'll get a few hours out of it.

3221
02:27:49.620 --> 02:27:51.570
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Follow the bait.

3222
02:27:52.420 --> 02:27:53.320
Okay.

3223
02:27:53.320 --> 02:27:56.920
When we find a place that looks nice

3224
02:27:56.920 --> 02:27:58.370
for setting up camp.
Okay.

3225
02:27:59.640 --> 02:28:01.770
So as you pull off into this space here,

3226
02:28:01.770 --> 02:28:06.250
there's patches of trees and little elements

3227
02:28:06.250 --> 02:28:08.300
of scattered woodland.

3228
02:28:08.300 --> 02:28:11.490
You wait as the last bit of the sunlight begins

3229
02:28:11.490 --> 02:28:14.760
to escape from the sky, and the gold and reds

3230
02:28:14.760 --> 02:28:16.760
of sunset begin to vanish in with the purples

3231
02:28:16.760 --> 02:28:17.710
and blues of night.

3232
02:28:18.769 --> 02:28:20.310
You begin to find a place to set up camp,

3233
02:28:20.310 --> 02:28:22.110
and you see what looks to be a distant fire,

3234
02:28:22.110 --> 02:28:25.150
maybe about a half mile or so away from you.

3235
02:28:25.150 --> 02:28:27.030
What kind of fire, big fire?

3236
02:28:27.030 --> 02:28:27.890
Or like campfire?

3237
02:28:27.890 --> 02:28:30.230
Like a standard campfire size.

3238
02:28:30.230 --> 02:28:32.560
Can you see any figures, any shapes--

3239
02:28:32.560 --> 02:28:33.810
Not from this distance.

3240
02:28:35.069 --> 02:28:35.960
You have to get a lot closer.

3241
02:28:35.960 --> 02:28:36.793
Want me to go check it out?

3242
02:28:36.793 --> 02:28:38.660
Are we on the flat lands, or is it sort of a descent

3243
02:28:38.660 --> 02:28:39.560
down to that fire?

3244
02:28:39.560 --> 02:28:42.390
Right here, there's hills to the north

3245
02:28:42.390 --> 02:28:43.610
and south sides of it, right now,

3246
02:28:43.610 --> 02:28:46.020
it's in the middle of a small valley

3247
02:28:46.020 --> 02:28:47.570
between this hilly portion.

3248
02:28:49.680 --> 02:28:51.550
Let's go?
All of us?

3249
02:28:51.550 --> 02:28:52.383
No.

3250
02:28:52.383 --> 02:28:53.780
Well, we can just make camp.

3251
02:28:53.780 --> 02:28:55.080
Just ignore it?
Yeah.

3252
02:28:56.040 --> 02:28:58.550
I mean, they stay over there, we stay over here.

3253
02:28:58.550 --> 02:29:00.841
Nott goes, checks it out.
I'm going to go check it out,

3254
02:29:00.841 --> 02:29:02.930
for sure.
Well, I was going to say,

3255
02:29:02.930 --> 02:29:04.780
I wonder if we can make camp close enough

3256
02:29:04.780 --> 02:29:07.580
that everything, we could check it out.

3257
02:29:07.580 --> 02:29:08.413
Yeah.

3258
02:29:09.370 --> 02:29:12.380
Sneak near the unknown quantity.

3259
02:29:12.380 --> 02:29:13.890
Yeah.
But we can,

3260
02:29:13.890 --> 02:29:14.810
we don't even have--
Because you have a hut.

3261
02:29:14.810 --> 02:29:15.643
Yeah, we have a hut.

3262
02:29:15.643 --> 02:29:16.790
We could just be wherever.

3263
02:29:16.790 --> 02:29:18.570
They don't, they can fuck off.

3264
02:29:20.600 --> 02:29:21.433
Yeah, but, why?

3265
02:29:21.433 --> 02:29:25.700
Okay, I am a team player.
(Jester laughing)

3266
02:29:25.700 --> 02:29:27.100
Is this where we want to be?

3267
02:29:28.100 --> 02:29:28.933
How is this?

3268
02:29:30.270 --> 02:29:31.881
It's fine.
It's fine.

3269
02:29:31.881 --> 02:29:34.132
(laughter)

3270
02:29:34.132 --> 02:29:36.790
All right.
Definitely fine.

3271
02:29:36.790 --> 02:29:39.580
Muddled, Caleb starts to do what he needs to do

3272
02:29:39.580 --> 02:29:41.710
to put the dome up, and it'll be the same color green

3273
02:29:41.710 --> 02:29:43.940
as the grass that is growing all around.

3274
02:29:43.940 --> 02:29:44.773
All right.

3275
02:29:45.820 --> 02:29:47.200
You guys bundle up for the night.

3276
02:29:47.200 --> 02:29:48.640
You feel safer in the dome.

3277
02:29:48.640 --> 02:29:49.810
You can keep watch if you'd like,

3278
02:29:49.810 --> 02:29:51.080
or you can all just take a night's rest.

3279
02:29:51.080 --> 02:29:53.250
It'll last for eight hours, so.

3280
02:29:53.250 --> 02:29:55.180
I want to go check out that campfire or no?

3281
02:29:55.180 --> 02:29:56.460
Yeah, we're doing that--
Do you want to go check

3282
02:29:56.460 --> 02:29:57.680
out the campfire?
I feel like

3283
02:29:57.680 --> 02:29:59.360
we all want to check out the campfire.

3284
02:29:59.360 --> 02:30:01.100
I think it only matters what you want to do,

3285
02:30:01.100 --> 02:30:02.100
in this situation.

3286
02:30:03.160 --> 02:30:04.190
Ah, yeah, I'll go check it out.

3287
02:30:04.190 --> 02:30:05.390
Well, all right, then.

3288
02:30:06.752 --> 02:30:07.860
Do you want me to come close?

3289
02:30:07.860 --> 02:30:09.720
Of course.
Okay, I'll follow,

3290
02:30:09.720 --> 02:30:11.320
but at a distance.

3291
02:30:11.320 --> 02:30:14.320
And I remove the rocks from the dome.

3292
02:30:14.320 --> 02:30:15.170
The rocks?

3293
02:30:15.170 --> 02:30:16.530
Oh, good idea.
Yeah.

3294
02:30:17.574 --> 02:30:20.930
I'm going to sit outside the dome until you guys

3295
02:30:20.930 --> 02:30:24.010
come back, just so that there's somebody who can hear it

3296
02:30:24.010 --> 02:30:25.200
if you signal for help.

3297
02:30:26.080 --> 02:30:31.040
And while they're away, Caleb will also turn Frumpkin

3298
02:30:31.040 --> 02:30:33.310
into a raven.
Okay.

3299
02:30:34.532 --> 02:30:36.700
Just go ahead and mark off the elements of that.

3300
02:30:36.700 --> 02:30:41.080
I'm going to, as we get close,

3301
02:30:41.080 --> 02:30:44.640
I'm going to cast Enhance Ability on Nott.

3302
02:30:44.640 --> 02:30:46.800
I'm going to cast Cat's Grace,

3303
02:30:46.800 --> 02:30:48.080
so that you have better,

3304
02:30:48.080 --> 02:30:50.090
you have advantage on dexterity checks.

3305
02:30:51.100 --> 02:30:52.640
Okay.

3306
02:30:52.640 --> 02:30:54.290
I don't know.
(laughter)

3307
02:30:54.290 --> 02:30:56.657
Sam's never seen one.
Yeah.

3308
02:30:56.657 --> 02:30:59.100
♪ Jellicle cats, Jellicle cats, Jellicle cats ♪

3309
02:30:59.100 --> 02:31:01.730
Oh, yeah.
Sing it, sing it.

3310
02:31:01.730 --> 02:31:03.330
As we get closer, I'll cast, well,

3311
02:31:03.330 --> 02:31:06.760
when we get close enough, I'll cast Invisibility on myself.

3312
02:31:06.760 --> 02:31:08.320
Okay, well, go ahead and roll a stealth check

3313
02:31:08.320 --> 02:31:10.300
as you approach.
Oh, you already

3314
02:31:10.300 --> 02:31:11.690
get advantage on that.
Got advantage

3315
02:31:11.690 --> 02:31:12.523
on it already.

3316
02:31:14.830 --> 02:31:16.800
28.
28.

3317
02:31:16.800 --> 02:31:19.263
You feel fairly confident that no one has seen you

3318
02:31:19.263 --> 02:31:22.930
get within a safe distance of the campfire.

3319
02:31:24.440 --> 02:31:26.230
I'll go invisible.
All right.

3320
02:31:26.230 --> 02:31:29.450
And creep ever closer, looking for--

3321
02:31:29.450 --> 02:31:30.283
Okay.

3322
02:31:30.283 --> 02:31:33.890
As you're looking, you can see the source of the fire

3323
02:31:33.890 --> 02:31:38.890
that appears like there's a few bundles around it.

3324
02:31:39.030 --> 02:31:40.390
There's a few figures sitting in the bundles,

3325
02:31:40.390 --> 02:31:42.570
looking into the fire.

3326
02:31:42.570 --> 02:31:44.500
You can see there's between the hill,

3327
02:31:44.500 --> 02:31:46.840
like a pace here, there's a little gap,

3328
02:31:46.840 --> 02:31:51.760
and there's some, what looks like a carcass

3329
02:31:51.760 --> 02:31:54.450
has been left in the outskirts,

3330
02:31:54.450 --> 02:31:56.700
between you and the campfire,

3331
02:31:56.700 --> 02:31:59.130
a little bit southward, I guess.

3332
02:31:59.130 --> 02:32:01.740
They're not cooking it, it's just a dead thing?

3333
02:32:01.740 --> 02:32:02.573
Correct.

3334
02:32:02.573 --> 02:32:04.530
So it's a ways away, but there it is.

3335
02:32:06.280 --> 02:32:07.380
Towards me, or on the other side?

3336
02:32:07.380 --> 02:32:08.680
Towards you.
Well, I'm going to go

3337
02:32:08.680 --> 02:32:10.470
look at that carcass.
Okay.

3338
02:32:11.540 --> 02:32:13.670
As you get closer to the carcass,

3339
02:32:13.670 --> 02:32:18.487
you can see what looks to be a hunt's,

3340
02:32:19.530 --> 02:32:22.180
you see there are arrows in it,

3341
02:32:22.180 --> 02:32:24.850
and elements of it have been butchered and left open.

3342
02:32:24.850 --> 02:32:26.730
Only a little bit of meat has been cut off,

3343
02:32:26.730 --> 02:32:29.270
and the rest of it's just been left there.

3344
02:32:29.270 --> 02:32:31.980
But what, do I recognize the animal?

3345
02:32:31.980 --> 02:32:33.870
You have to get closer to probably take a look.

3346
02:32:35.030 --> 02:32:36.260
I get closer.
Okay.

3347
02:32:38.603 --> 02:32:41.487
You get right up next to the carcass

3348
02:32:42.480 --> 02:32:45.285
and look at it, and right as you do, you hear this

3349
02:32:45.285 --> 02:32:46.435
(whooshing)
Oh shit.

3350
02:32:47.280 --> 02:32:49.340
Go ahead and make dexterity saving throw for me.

3351
02:32:49.340 --> 02:32:50.330
But you get advantage.

3352
02:32:50.330 --> 02:32:51.163
Nope, that's--
I do?

3353
02:32:51.163 --> 02:32:52.810
Not at saving throws, no.

3354
02:32:52.810 --> 02:32:55.780
Dex save, 12.
12!

3355
02:32:57.280 --> 02:32:59.350
You got a 12 on your dex save!

3356
02:32:59.350 --> 02:33:02.790
I rolled a three.
(Matt laughing)

3357
02:33:03.750 --> 02:33:05.160
Oh no.
Oh no.

3358
02:33:05.160 --> 02:33:06.750
No, he rubbed his hands together.

3359
02:33:06.750 --> 02:33:08.600
He's doing the hands.
You hear the whoosh,

3360
02:33:08.600 --> 02:33:10.680
and you see, suddenly, from just over the hill,

3361
02:33:10.680 --> 02:33:13.120
there was a thin, tall tree

3362
02:33:13.120 --> 02:33:15.170
that had been ratcheted down and held,

3363
02:33:15.170 --> 02:33:17.720
go (whooshing) and arch upward, and suddenly,

3364
02:33:17.720 --> 02:33:20.200
your ankle pulls out from under you,

3365
02:33:20.200 --> 02:33:23.140
and you get flung through the air for a second,

3366
02:33:23.140 --> 02:33:27.375
and flung down, you hang for a second.

3367
02:33:27.375 --> 02:33:29.800
(screeching) After you--
I'm still invisible, though.

3368
02:33:29.800 --> 02:33:30.633
You are.
Okay,

3369
02:33:30.633 --> 02:33:32.470
but they know that something's there.

3370
02:33:32.470 --> 02:33:34.000
Fucking Ewoks.
Okay.

3371
02:33:34.000 --> 02:33:36.790
You got Looney Tunes.
Suddenly, the figures

3372
02:33:36.790 --> 02:33:38.280
all stand up,

3373
02:33:38.280 --> 02:33:40.370
look over in the direction of the tree.

3374
02:33:40.370 --> 02:33:42.420
One of them goes ahead and gets, grabs a bow,

3375
02:33:42.420 --> 02:33:44.130
and knocks an arrow.
I start getting closer,

3376
02:33:44.130 --> 02:33:47.000
sneaking as close as I can.
You've been following Nott.

3377
02:33:47.000 --> 02:33:48.870
Well, yeah, that's why I was able to--

3378
02:33:48.870 --> 02:33:50.110
Yeah.
I see the tree--

3379
02:33:50.110 --> 02:33:52.040
Oh, yeah, you see the tree go.

3380
02:33:52.040 --> 02:33:54.020
Ah, fuck.
All right.

3381
02:33:55.300 --> 02:33:57.180
Ah, okay.

3382
02:33:57.180 --> 02:34:01.120
Um, I guess if they haven't seen me,

3383
02:34:01.120 --> 02:34:03.010
let's see, what will lose my invisibility?

3384
02:34:03.010 --> 02:34:05.130
Attacking anything, right?

3385
02:34:05.130 --> 02:34:05.963
Or fire--

3386
02:34:05.963 --> 02:34:07.280
Attacking and casting a spell.

3387
02:34:07.280 --> 02:34:08.140
Spells.
Casting a spell.

3388
02:34:08.140 --> 02:34:11.390
Attacking, but using a weapon to cut a rope?

3389
02:34:11.390 --> 02:34:13.241
Is that an attack?
That won't break it, no.

3390
02:34:13.241 --> 02:34:14.961
Okay, okay.

3391
02:34:14.961 --> 02:34:17.560
(sighing) Okay.
Let's see, Traveler,

3392
02:34:17.560 --> 02:34:20.400
be with me, as I'm going.
Okay.

3393
02:34:20.400 --> 02:34:25.280
I will, I'll get out my short sword, or my dagger,

3394
02:34:25.280 --> 02:34:27.420
and I'll start cutting the rope a bit.

3395
02:34:27.420 --> 02:34:28.290
Okay.

3396
02:34:28.290 --> 02:34:29.640
Easy enough to cut it,

3397
02:34:29.640 --> 02:34:31.770
and your foot comes lose.
23.

3398
02:34:31.770 --> 02:34:34.930
It's, it's not a very intricate knot,

3399
02:34:34.930 --> 02:34:36.910
nor is it a, it's a thick piece of rope,

3400
02:34:36.910 --> 02:34:39.530
but this blade is easy enough to cut through, 23?

3401
02:34:39.530 --> 02:34:40.363
You go ahead and approach,

3402
02:34:40.363 --> 02:34:41.600
and you can see that the figure's rushing

3403
02:34:41.600 --> 02:34:44.220
towards the tree.
Oh shit.

3404
02:34:44.220 --> 02:34:45.780
You get the sense that, at the moment,

3405
02:34:45.780 --> 02:34:47.340
they do not notice you,

3406
02:34:47.340 --> 02:34:49.570
because they are focused more on what has just transpired

3407
02:34:49.570 --> 02:34:51.060
at the south of their camp.
Okay.

3408
02:34:51.060 --> 02:34:52.410
How high up am I?

3409
02:34:52.410 --> 02:34:55.720
Dangling, I'd say you're about 10 feet up.

3410
02:34:55.720 --> 02:34:58.470
Oh, oh God, I don't know what to do.

3411
02:34:58.470 --> 02:34:59.470
I'm going to wait 'til they get closer.

3412
02:34:59.470 --> 02:35:01.560
Actually, you'd be about 15, because your weight

3413
02:35:01.560 --> 02:35:04.130
is so minimal compared to what this trap was designed for.

3414
02:35:04.130 --> 02:35:06.150
Are they around me at this point,

3415
02:35:06.150 --> 02:35:07.620
or are they approaching?
They're approaching,

3416
02:35:07.620 --> 02:35:09.790
and look up now, and they're like,

3417
02:35:09.790 --> 02:35:11.660
you can see the back of their head.

3418
02:35:11.660 --> 02:35:13.650
But actually, you have Dark Vision, right, as a goblin--

3419
02:35:13.650 --> 02:35:14.940
I do.
So you can see

3420
02:35:14.940 --> 02:35:16.790
an element of them.

3421
02:35:16.790 --> 02:35:17.990
They appear to be human,

3422
02:35:18.970 --> 02:35:21.186
simple leather armor, caps on,

3423
02:35:21.186 --> 02:35:23.890
some hunting gear and weapons.

3424
02:35:23.890 --> 02:35:26.670
And they look up, and they'll go,

3425
02:35:26.670 --> 02:35:28.530
oh, shit it broke.

3426
02:35:28.530 --> 02:35:30.340
Where the fuck did it go?

3427
02:35:30.340 --> 02:35:31.830
Shit, shit.

3428
02:35:33.720 --> 02:35:36.730
I'll just wait a bit, see if they run off.

3429
02:35:36.730 --> 02:35:37.690
Okay.

3430
02:35:37.690 --> 02:35:40.020
What are you?
Well, I'm waiting

3431
02:35:40.020 --> 02:35:42.320
to see if they attack at Nott or anything.

3432
02:35:42.320 --> 02:35:43.153
They don't.

3433
02:35:44.140 --> 02:35:45.580
They scatter a bit around the space

3434
02:35:45.580 --> 02:35:46.890
and begin looking in the area.

3435
02:35:46.890 --> 02:35:48.580
One of them goes over, back to the carcass,

3436
02:35:48.580 --> 02:35:52.810
he looks around at it.

3437
02:35:52.810 --> 02:35:54.210
Are you doing anything, Nott?

3438
02:35:54.210 --> 02:35:55.350
I'm still just waiting.

3439
02:35:55.350 --> 02:35:57.360
They're still around the vicinity, right?

3440
02:35:57.360 --> 02:35:59.970
They're starting to scatter a bit, and scan,

3441
02:35:59.970 --> 02:36:01.410
and from this position, you can see

3442
02:36:01.410 --> 02:36:03.820
there are few different corpses,

3443
02:36:03.820 --> 02:36:05.100
of other creatures that have been hunted,

3444
02:36:05.100 --> 02:36:07.310
and you can see they've cooked up elements of some of them,

3445
02:36:07.310 --> 02:36:10.560
and they've been eating at the fire in the center,

3446
02:36:10.560 --> 02:36:12.370
and elements have been left out,

3447
02:36:12.370 --> 02:36:14.270
and you can see now, from this perspective,

3448
02:36:14.270 --> 02:36:15.840
actually, make a perception check for me.

3449
02:36:15.840 --> 02:36:16.673
All right--
I feel like

3450
02:36:16.673 --> 02:36:19.000
it's just a hunting party.
For sure it does.

3451
02:36:19.000 --> 02:36:22.180
18 plus one, 19.
19.

3452
02:36:22.180 --> 02:36:24.660
You can see, near some of these other corpses,

3453
02:36:24.660 --> 02:36:28.660
there are a few other contraptions similar to this.

3454
02:36:28.660 --> 02:36:29.922
Sometimes, one of them's a little more

3455
02:36:29.922 --> 02:36:33.750
of a net-type thing, but these are very, very basic

3456
02:36:33.750 --> 02:36:36.030
hunting traps that have been set up around here.

3457
02:36:36.030 --> 02:36:38.574
I shouldn't kill them all.
(Fjord snorting)

3458
02:36:38.574 --> 02:36:39.740
Probably not.

3459
02:36:39.740 --> 02:36:41.020
All right.
Just some.

3460
02:36:41.020 --> 02:36:43.400
I will, as deftly as possible,

3461
02:36:45.420 --> 02:36:49.174
drop from my location.
Okay.

3462
02:36:49.174 --> 02:36:51.210
And try to land without making too much noise.

3463
02:36:51.210 --> 02:36:52.430
A 10 point landing.
Make stealth check

3464
02:36:52.430 --> 02:36:55.400
with advantage.
(dice clattering)

3465
02:36:55.400 --> 02:36:56.550
Ooh.
A Natural 20.

3466
02:36:57.430 --> 02:36:58.847
You don't even take any fall damage.

3467
02:36:58.847 --> 02:36:59.760
(laughter)
You just.

3468
02:37:00.922 --> 02:37:02.872
Just a little bit of dust goes.

3469
02:37:02.872 --> 02:37:05.670
(laughter)
Super quiet.

3470
02:37:05.670 --> 02:37:06.560
No one notices.

3471
02:37:06.560 --> 02:37:08.070
You can see them looking around,

3472
02:37:08.070 --> 02:37:12.190
and they look a little jittery and nervous,

3473
02:37:12.190 --> 02:37:15.020
as whatever it was broke their trap,

3474
02:37:15.020 --> 02:37:16.360
and they see nothing moving around,

3475
02:37:16.360 --> 02:37:19.600
and they're in a really unfortunate space right now

3476
02:37:20.710 --> 02:37:22.500
of trying to figure what happened.

3477
02:37:22.500 --> 02:37:24.940
These poor people.
The damn possums.

3478
02:37:24.940 --> 02:37:27.260
As far as I know, Nott is still up in the tree.

3479
02:37:27.260 --> 02:37:28.093
Mm-hmm.
Okay.

3480
02:37:29.290 --> 02:37:30.945
Should I rob them first, or just--

3481
02:37:30.945 --> 02:37:31.930
(laughter)

3482
02:37:31.930 --> 02:37:34.698
All right, I'm going to try to slip between them,

3483
02:37:34.698 --> 02:37:38.674
and keep heading out, keep, head back to our camp.

3484
02:37:38.674 --> 02:37:39.800
Okay.

3485
02:37:39.800 --> 02:37:42.370
They do not notice you in the middle of the night

3486
02:37:42.370 --> 02:37:43.900
with your invisible self,

3487
02:37:43.900 --> 02:37:45.200
who's also super stealthy.

3488
02:37:46.250 --> 02:37:48.620
They are, you know,

3489
02:37:48.620 --> 02:37:50.900
you don't really take a moment to see anything,

3490
02:37:50.900 --> 02:37:52.300
other than just darting through the gap

3491
02:37:52.300 --> 02:37:53.430
of where they are.

3492
02:37:53.430 --> 02:37:55.180
Is there, there's a tiny piece of rope

3493
02:37:55.180 --> 02:37:56.970
that's just scattering through the,

3494
02:37:56.970 --> 02:37:59.920
is the rope visible that's still around his ankle?

3495
02:37:59.920 --> 02:38:00.753
Well, no.

3496
02:38:00.753 --> 02:38:02.390
The rope had been cut like, in a way

3497
02:38:02.390 --> 02:38:03.780
where it released--
Darn,

3498
02:38:03.780 --> 02:38:06.370
I was really hoping a tiny little rope just--

3499
02:38:06.370 --> 02:38:07.203
Yep.

3500
02:38:08.254 --> 02:38:09.604
What are you doing, Jester?

3501
02:38:10.744 --> 02:38:13.210
I'm going to wait until they get far enough away

3502
02:38:13.210 --> 02:38:15.670
from the tree, and then, I'm going to go try to get Nott

3503
02:38:15.670 --> 02:38:17.140
out of the tree.
Okay.

3504
02:38:17.140 --> 02:38:18.770
Oh God.
Okay.

3505
02:38:18.770 --> 02:38:20.880
They eventually begin to circle around

3506
02:38:20.880 --> 02:38:22.465
the northern side, doing their perimeter,

3507
02:38:22.465 --> 02:38:25.940
and you see a moment where you can scoot through.

3508
02:38:25.940 --> 02:38:27.980
Yeah, I go up to the trap.

3509
02:38:27.980 --> 02:38:29.710
You rush up, and look up in the tree,

3510
02:38:29.710 --> 02:38:32.300
and the rope is just dangling loose.

3511
02:38:32.300 --> 02:38:33.800
Nott, Nott.

3512
02:38:35.110 --> 02:38:36.550
I've left that area already.

3513
02:38:36.550 --> 02:38:38.060
Yep.
Nott.

3514
02:38:39.180 --> 02:38:42.200
Shit, I'm going to cast Sending.

3515
02:38:42.200 --> 02:38:43.620
Jester?

3516
02:38:43.620 --> 02:38:44.453
I'm going to cast Sending--

3517
02:38:44.453 --> 02:38:45.400
Jester!
To Nott.

3518
02:38:46.519 --> 02:38:49.620
Nott, are you still, are you in the tree?

3519
02:38:49.620 --> 02:38:51.310
Where are you?
No, I'm not in the tree.

3520
02:38:51.310 --> 02:38:52.143
You can't respond.

3521
02:38:52.143 --> 02:38:52.976
I'm still talking.

3522
02:38:52.976 --> 02:38:56.000
Wait 'til I finish talking, and then you can respond.

3523
02:38:56.000 --> 02:38:58.355
Just let me know--
That's way over the words.

3524
02:38:58.355 --> 02:39:01.100
(laughter)
I'm not in the tree.

3525
02:39:01.100 --> 02:39:05.870
I'm gone, meet, oh shit, where are you?

3526
02:39:06.720 --> 02:39:08.910
Are you both invisible?

3527
02:39:08.910 --> 02:39:09.970
No.
Oh.

3528
02:39:09.970 --> 02:39:12.354
But Nott's like back at camp now.

3529
02:39:12.354 --> 02:39:13.860
(laughter)

3530
02:39:13.860 --> 02:39:17.100
I point in a direction of where I think she might be,

3531
02:39:17.100 --> 02:39:18.830
and I cast Message.

3532
02:39:20.030 --> 02:39:21.370
Can you hear me?

3533
02:39:21.370 --> 02:39:22.470
Jester, where are you?

3534
02:39:24.653 --> 02:39:27.810
At this point, you're just out, was it a 500 range?

3535
02:39:27.810 --> 02:39:29.718
No, it's 120, I think.
120?

3536
02:39:29.718 --> 02:39:30.551
Yeah.

3537
02:39:30.551 --> 02:39:31.384
Oh, no.
Double check.

3538
02:39:31.384 --> 02:39:32.350
I thought it was shorter than that.

3539
02:39:32.350 --> 02:39:34.680
120, yeah.
Yeah, so yeah.

3540
02:39:34.680 --> 02:39:36.380
Nothing.
I don't want to go back.

3541
02:39:37.280 --> 02:39:38.113
Shit.

3542
02:39:40.320 --> 02:39:42.390
I'll run back to camp.

3543
02:39:42.390 --> 02:39:45.260
Hey, hey, hey, hi, hi.

3544
02:39:45.260 --> 02:39:47.450
They're not bad at all, they're fine.

3545
02:39:47.450 --> 02:39:49.540
Okay.
Did Jester come back?

3546
02:39:49.540 --> 02:39:50.790
Nope.
No.

3547
02:39:50.790 --> 02:39:52.440
Okay, it's fine, it's fine.

3548
02:39:52.440 --> 02:39:53.620
Wait, I--
No, it's fine.

3549
02:39:53.620 --> 02:39:55.810
It's fine, she's just, I'll be right back.

3550
02:39:55.810 --> 02:39:56.643
You have five minutes.

3551
02:39:56.643 --> 02:39:59.810
I start stealthily making my way back to our camp.

3552
02:39:59.810 --> 02:40:01.060
Into the camp?
Okay.

3553
02:40:02.200 --> 02:40:04.104
Both of you make perception checks.

3554
02:40:04.104 --> 02:40:06.106
(yelling)
(laughter)

3555
02:40:06.106 --> 02:40:09.050
I'm so excited.
Oh no.

3556
02:40:09.050 --> 02:40:10.646
Five.
Seven.

3557
02:40:10.646 --> 02:40:11.810
(laughter)

3558
02:40:11.810 --> 02:40:15.156
You pass each other. (laughs)

3559
02:40:15.156 --> 02:40:16.380
All right, okay.

3560
02:40:16.380 --> 02:40:18.350
All right, I get back to our camp.

3561
02:40:18.350 --> 02:40:21.380
Jester, Jester, where are you?

3562
02:40:21.380 --> 02:40:23.935
You see one of them go, I heard something.

3563
02:40:23.935 --> 02:40:25.620
(laughter)

3564
02:40:25.620 --> 02:40:26.850
I peek my head into the bubble.

3565
02:40:26.850 --> 02:40:28.690
Hey, um--
No, I'm--

3566
02:40:28.690 --> 02:40:30.040
Is Nott back then?

3567
02:40:30.040 --> 02:40:31.520
She was just looking for you.

3568
02:40:31.520 --> 02:40:33.040
She was looking for me?

3569
02:40:33.040 --> 02:40:34.720
She just went to go look for you.

3570
02:40:34.720 --> 02:40:36.563
For me?
You probably just passed

3571
02:40:36.563 --> 02:40:38.950
each other.
Okay, okay, okay.

3572
02:40:38.950 --> 02:40:40.540
Don't worry about it, I'll be right back.

3573
02:40:40.540 --> 02:40:42.330
Or you can stay here.
And I go--

3574
02:40:42.330 --> 02:40:44.153
The two of them now have bow and arrows knocked--

3575
02:40:44.153 --> 02:40:46.720
I'm going to start shuffling back to get to Nott.

3576
02:40:46.720 --> 02:40:47.840
In front of the dome.
The third one

3577
02:40:47.840 --> 02:40:49.450
has two short swords at the ready,

3578
02:40:49.450 --> 02:40:50.880
and you can see now they're both doing,

3579
02:40:50.880 --> 02:40:51.890
earlier, they were a little spooked.

3580
02:40:51.890 --> 02:40:54.650
Now, they're like, fuck, something's here.

3581
02:40:56.470 --> 02:40:57.680
So wait, you're running back?

3582
02:40:57.680 --> 02:41:00.059
I'm going back to their camp now.

3583
02:41:00.059 --> 02:41:01.500
Make another stealth check.

3584
02:41:03.280 --> 02:41:04.260
Oh.

3585
02:41:04.260 --> 02:41:06.930
Uh, 23.
Okay.

3586
02:41:06.930 --> 02:41:08.590
23.
I'm just scanning around

3587
02:41:08.590 --> 02:41:09.780
their camp, looking for her.

3588
02:41:09.780 --> 02:41:10.810
Have they captured her?

3589
02:41:10.810 --> 02:41:11.643
Is she in a trap?

3590
02:41:11.643 --> 02:41:13.247
I start looking at all that carcasses.

3591
02:41:13.247 --> 02:41:15.740
(laughter)
Okay.

3592
02:41:15.740 --> 02:41:17.080
Shoved her in an ox.

3593
02:41:17.080 --> 02:41:19.160
Well, like, then, I assume there's traps near the--

3594
02:41:19.160 --> 02:41:21.190
Yeah, you don't see any of the traps set off.

3595
02:41:22.048 --> 02:41:24.690
But you see them ready to go for a fight.

3596
02:41:24.690 --> 02:41:26.340
Shit, shit.

3597
02:41:30.570 --> 02:41:31.403
Okay.

3598
02:41:32.260 --> 02:41:35.230
I'll go halfway back towards our camp.

3599
02:41:35.230 --> 02:41:37.740
Okay, both of you guys make perception checks.

3600
02:41:37.740 --> 02:41:39.593
Oh no, no, no.
Is this perception?

3601
02:41:39.593 --> 02:41:41.570
Yeah.
13.

3602
02:41:41.570 --> 02:41:44.120
15.
You keep running

3603
02:41:44.120 --> 02:41:46.060
back to their camp, and you stop halfway,

3604
02:41:46.060 --> 02:41:48.093
you don't see each other, because you're both being stealthy

3605
02:41:48.093 --> 02:41:52.350
in the night.
(laughter)

3606
02:41:52.350 --> 02:41:54.010
And you're always missing each other.

3607
02:41:54.010 --> 02:41:56.110
I'm going to say a--
Right next to each other.

3608
02:41:56.110 --> 02:41:58.600
Say a silent prayer, load up my crossbow

3609
02:41:58.600 --> 02:42:02.660
with a flare bolt, and shoot it straight up.

3610
02:42:02.660 --> 02:42:04.200
Okay.

3611
02:42:04.200 --> 02:42:06.410
Jester, as you're running, all of a sudden,

3612
02:42:06.410 --> 02:42:09.750
this bright light (whooshing) fills up the space

3613
02:42:09.750 --> 02:42:14.750
around you, and you look up at this flare bolt (whooshing)

3614
02:42:15.260 --> 02:42:18.410
leading this trail of burning flame.

3615
02:42:18.410 --> 02:42:19.490
Jester!
What?

3616
02:42:19.490 --> 02:42:22.120
Jester!
Nott, I hear you!

3617
02:42:22.120 --> 02:42:25.350
Yasha.
I'm preparing Charm Persons.

3618
02:42:25.350 --> 02:42:28.170
You see three figures now rushing in your direction,

3619
02:42:28.170 --> 02:42:30.090
and you, as you're preparing, you kind glance over

3620
02:42:30.090 --> 02:42:31.870
and you hear, Sh.

3621
02:42:33.530 --> 02:42:34.870
Pretty tired.
Yeah.

3622
02:42:36.850 --> 02:42:39.340
Does an 18 hit you?
Pass me that--

3623
02:42:39.340 --> 02:42:40.473
The arrow--
That's under you?

3624
02:42:40.473 --> 02:42:41.610
(whooshing) Pass this way.

3625
02:42:41.610 --> 02:42:42.680
Ah!
Shit.

3626
02:42:42.680 --> 02:42:43.660
Let's go.
Oh, no, no, no.

3627
02:42:43.660 --> 02:42:44.820
No, no, no.
What do you mean, no?

3628
02:42:44.820 --> 02:42:46.464
How far away are they?

3629
02:42:46.464 --> 02:42:48.014
As this point, about 70 feet.

3630
02:42:50.428 --> 02:42:52.340
I'm going to, I'm going to.

3631
02:42:53.180 --> 02:42:54.230
Another arrow comes at you.

3632
02:42:54.230 --> 02:42:55.820
Then we duck.
Actually, the two arrows,

3633
02:42:55.820 --> 02:42:58.065
actually now, that's a 22.

3634
02:42:58.065 --> 02:42:59.590
LAURA: Shit.

3635
02:42:59.590 --> 02:43:02.456
MATT: And a 19.

3636
02:43:02.456 --> 02:43:03.756
LAURA: Uh-huh.
MATT: Okay.

3637
02:43:03.756 --> 02:43:05.114
MARISHA: Is she getting pelted with arrows?

3638
02:43:05.114 --> 02:43:05.947
TALIESIN: Yep.

3639
02:43:05.947 --> 02:43:07.148
(laughter)

3640
02:43:07.148 --> 02:43:09.410
LAURA: Wait, wait, wait.
MATT: You take four points

3641
02:43:09.410 --> 02:43:10.443
of piercing damage,

3642
02:43:10.443 --> 02:43:12.909
and you take three points of piercing damage.

3643
02:43:12.909 --> 02:43:13.910
SAM: Let's get out of here!

3644
02:43:13.910 --> 02:43:15.904
LAURA: I'm saying wait.
SAM: What do you mean, wait?!

3645
02:43:15.904 --> 02:43:18.640
LAURA: Wait, are they close?

3646
02:43:18.640 --> 02:43:20.370
MATT: No, the two of them are there just loading arrows

3647
02:43:20.370 --> 02:43:21.490
and firing.
LAURA: Ah, I'm going to zig zag

3648
02:43:21.490 --> 02:43:23.448
towards them.
SAM: Zig zag towards them?!

3649
02:43:23.448 --> 02:43:27.148
MATT: (laughs) Okay, you go running--

3650
02:43:27.148 --> 02:43:28.380
LAURA: Wait!
SAM: What are you doing?

3651
02:43:28.380 --> 02:43:29.213
LAURA: Wait!

3652
02:43:29.213 --> 02:43:31.711
MATT: You guys can hear this, by the way.

3653
02:43:31.711 --> 02:43:34.518
You guys saw this flare go, pfft up in the sky,

3654
02:43:34.518 --> 02:43:37.190
and started hearing yelling in the distance.

3655
02:43:37.190 --> 02:43:38.450
TALIESIN: I'm walking that direction.

3656
02:43:38.450 --> 02:43:40.494
LAURA: I'm going to cast-- how many are there?

3657
02:43:40.494 --> 02:43:41.327
MATT: There are three of them.

3658
02:43:41.327 --> 02:43:45.790
LAURA: I'm going to cast Charm Person at a 3rd-level.

3659
02:43:45.790 --> 02:43:46.781
MATT: Okay.

3660
02:43:46.781 --> 02:43:49.897
(laughter)

3661
02:43:51.511 --> 02:43:53.643
MARISHA: You're using--
MATT: It's a 19 on the first one.

3662
02:43:53.643 --> 02:43:55.290
LAURA: Shit.
MARISHA: -- scare tactics

3663
02:43:55.290 --> 02:43:57.581
to like--
MATT: Natural one on the second.

3664
02:43:58.620 --> 02:44:00.180
Wow, they're actually-- two of them rolled pretty well--

3665
02:44:00.180 --> 02:44:02.150
and 17 on the third one.

3666
02:44:02.150 --> 02:44:03.640
Well, 17 is is the wisdom check.

3667
02:44:03.640 --> 02:44:05.230
Okay, so two of them save, one of them doesn't.

3668
02:44:05.230 --> 02:44:06.063
Shit.

3669
02:44:06.063 --> 02:44:09.158
So one of them, who, the one who has both

3670
02:44:09.158 --> 02:44:12.360
of the swords at the sides, like stops and goes,

3671
02:44:12.360 --> 02:44:15.398
ah, don't worry about.
(laughter)

3672
02:44:15.398 --> 02:44:16.770
And the other one's like, what the fuck you talking about?

3673
02:44:17.644 --> 02:44:20.700
It's your friend Jester, it's your friend.

3674
02:44:20.700 --> 02:44:21.750
What are you doing, Jester?

3675
02:44:21.750 --> 02:44:23.760
Let's run.
Why?

3676
02:44:23.760 --> 02:44:25.460
You guys are approaching now at this point.

3677
02:44:25.460 --> 02:44:28.390
I'm walking towards, I'm walking towards, yeah, I've.

3678
02:44:28.390 --> 02:44:30.560
Yeah, we walk out, and the dome just goes (whooshing).

3679
02:44:30.560 --> 02:44:32.310
Yasha.
I've lit up my staff--

3680
02:44:32.310 --> 02:44:33.170
Yeah.
I'm walking towards it.

3681
02:44:33.170 --> 02:44:35.870
You want to just have a drink and watch from the hill?

3682
02:44:37.560 --> 02:44:38.400
Sure.
All right.

3683
02:44:38.400 --> 02:44:39.233
All right.

3684
02:44:39.233 --> 02:44:40.066
Yeah, I'm not going in there.

3685
02:44:40.066 --> 02:44:41.310
They got this.
All right.

3686
02:44:41.310 --> 02:44:43.490
The two that aren't trying to rush up,

3687
02:44:43.490 --> 02:44:44.930
seeing you put your hands there,

3688
02:44:44.930 --> 02:44:45.910
and they have their arrows knocking--

3689
02:44:45.910 --> 02:44:46.890
So why are you mad at me?

3690
02:44:46.890 --> 02:44:47.940
It's your friend.

3691
02:44:47.940 --> 02:44:50.110
Did it work?
It, huh?

3692
02:44:50.110 --> 02:44:50.943
The two, no.

3693
02:44:50.943 --> 02:44:52.550
Only one of them worked.
I know that,

3694
02:44:52.550 --> 02:44:53.520
I'm asking them.
Okay.

3695
02:44:53.520 --> 02:44:55.227
Oh, you're asking them?

3696
02:44:55.227 --> 02:44:56.450
They both look at each other.

3697
02:44:58.440 --> 02:45:00.990
You guys currently have, the flare is gone.

3698
02:45:00.990 --> 02:45:02.200
So there's no real light source.

3699
02:45:02.200 --> 02:45:04.100
They don't have as good of eyes as you,

3700
02:45:04.100 --> 02:45:07.380
so one of them goes, and like, the one who's charmed

3701
02:45:07.380 --> 02:45:09.180
in the back, goes, hold on, hold on.

3702
02:45:10.630 --> 02:45:12.750
Lights a torch, and approaches.

3703
02:45:12.750 --> 02:45:13.960
Don't worry, they're friends

3704
02:45:13.960 --> 02:45:14.793
Hey, we're friends.

3705
02:45:14.793 --> 02:45:15.800
And the two see, as they approach,

3706
02:45:15.800 --> 02:45:18.890
and they look at you and they go, fuck.

3707
02:45:20.578 --> 02:45:21.510
Fuck?
And they look

3708
02:45:21.510 --> 02:45:22.343
at each other--

3709
02:45:22.343 --> 02:45:23.640
Because we're--
And they both drop

3710
02:45:23.640 --> 02:45:27.790
their weapons, and go, we didn't know, we're so sorry.

3711
02:45:27.790 --> 02:45:29.020
Wait.
We're so sorry.

3712
02:45:29.020 --> 02:45:29.853
Okay, who are you?

3713
02:45:29.853 --> 02:45:31.740
We're just--
(Nott gasping)

3714
02:45:31.740 --> 02:45:33.101
Look, we're hunters.
It's you.

3715
02:45:33.101 --> 02:45:35.270
It's you.
It's you again.

3716
02:45:35.270 --> 02:45:36.770
You fuckers.

3717
02:45:36.770 --> 02:45:40.710
I shoot one in the leg.
(laughter)

3718
02:45:40.710 --> 02:45:42.470
Throw it. (laughs)

3719
02:45:42.470 --> 02:45:44.740
Oh.
I was hoping so hard.

3720
02:45:44.740 --> 02:45:46.080
Cheers.
22.

3721
02:45:46.080 --> 02:45:47.300
Clink.
If it's an emergency,

3722
02:45:47.300 --> 02:45:48.920
we can go down there, but I think--

3723
02:45:48.920 --> 02:45:51.600
No, this is more--
This is a great show.

3724
02:45:51.600 --> 02:45:52.940
Eight point, I don't get sneak attack.

3725
02:45:52.940 --> 02:45:54.940
Eight points of damage.
Okay.

3726
02:45:54.940 --> 02:45:56.550
Which one do you shoot, the one who's holding the torch,

3727
02:45:56.550 --> 02:45:58.070
or the two that have the bows?

3728
02:45:58.070 --> 02:45:59.380
The bow, the bow guys.
Okay.

3729
02:45:59.380 --> 02:46:01.490
So they go, (screaming).

3730
02:46:01.490 --> 02:46:03.592
What is going--
Please don't,

3731
02:46:03.592 --> 02:46:06.260
don't incinerate us, we didn't know.

3732
02:46:06.260 --> 02:46:07.800
Look, we're not thieving.

3733
02:46:07.800 --> 02:46:08.633
We're just hunting.

3734
02:46:08.633 --> 02:46:10.440
They were just hunting, Nott.

3735
02:46:11.430 --> 02:46:12.970
Yeah, but they're assholes.

3736
02:46:12.970 --> 02:46:14.999
We'll listen to you, we'll listen to you.

3737
02:46:14.999 --> 02:46:17.490
Whatever--
Stealing in general.

3738
02:46:17.490 --> 02:46:19.190
No, no, no, we haven't, I swear to God,

3739
02:46:19.190 --> 02:46:21.310
we didn't--
She can read minds.

3740
02:46:21.310 --> 02:46:22.710
I can.
Read their mind.

3741
02:46:23.950 --> 02:46:25.580
Zone of Truth.
Oh, oh, that,

3742
02:46:25.580 --> 02:46:26.850
I don't have it prepared, but I'm--

3743
02:46:26.850 --> 02:46:27.980
Just say that you're doing it.

3744
02:46:27.980 --> 02:46:29.860
I'm casting Zone of Truth on them,

3745
02:46:29.860 --> 02:46:31.070
but I'm not actually--
Deception check

3746
02:46:31.070 --> 02:46:33.109
with advantage.
Okay, good.

3747
02:46:33.109 --> 02:46:38.109
(Jester laughing)
Oh, oh, oh, 19 plus.

3748
02:46:38.360 --> 02:46:42.970
Stuff.
19 plus five, 24.

3749
02:46:42.970 --> 02:46:44.060
She can tell the truth.

3750
02:46:44.060 --> 02:46:46.130
She can tell if you're telling the truth.

3751
02:46:46.130 --> 02:46:47.810
I'll get it, that's fine.

3752
02:46:47.810 --> 02:46:48.740
Have you been stealing?

3753
02:46:48.740 --> 02:46:50.530
No.
Huh.

3754
02:46:50.530 --> 02:46:52.733
They're telling the truth.

3755
02:46:52.733 --> 02:46:56.230
Well, we haven't been robbing.

3756
02:46:56.230 --> 02:46:57.480
Mm.
What does that mean?

3757
02:46:57.480 --> 02:47:00.010
What does that mean?
What does that mean?

3758
02:47:00.010 --> 02:47:01.860
We're not doing like, he's like, shut up, man.

3759
02:47:01.860 --> 02:47:03.160
No--
He's like, I can't lie.

3760
02:47:03.160 --> 02:47:04.720
She put the magic on us.

3761
02:47:05.560 --> 02:47:07.780
Well, when we--
(laughter)

3762
02:47:07.780 --> 02:47:10.120
We're not robbing people, we're not anymore,

3763
02:47:10.120 --> 02:47:12.200
and you know, couldn't afford everything,

3764
02:47:12.200 --> 02:47:13.770
so we took a couple of things when they weren't looking,

3765
02:47:13.770 --> 02:47:15.420
and it wasn't a big thing.
That's not that bad,

3766
02:47:15.420 --> 02:47:16.253
that's not bad.
That's fine.

3767
02:47:16.253 --> 02:47:17.560
As long as you're not attacking people

3768
02:47:17.560 --> 02:47:18.890
when you're stealing things, right?

3769
02:47:18.890 --> 02:47:20.600
We're selling pelts and stuff.

3770
02:47:20.600 --> 02:47:22.010
Oh, okay, that's very good.

3771
02:47:22.010 --> 02:47:24.100
I'm proud of you for making an honest living.

3772
02:47:24.100 --> 02:47:26.210
We were just checking up on you to make sure you were--

3773
02:47:26.210 --> 02:47:28.170
You know.
On the straight and narrow.

3774
02:47:28.170 --> 02:47:30.360
And the guy with the torch goes, I believe them.

3775
02:47:30.360 --> 02:47:32.020
(laughter)
You know?

3776
02:47:32.020 --> 02:47:35.712
A giant red ape lumbers slowly past Jester--

3777
02:47:35.712 --> 02:47:39.930
(screaming) And they just run, they just run screaming

3778
02:47:39.930 --> 02:47:40.910
into the night.
No, come back.

3779
02:47:40.910 --> 02:47:43.310
You have all your, your pelts.

3780
02:47:43.310 --> 02:47:45.050
And the ape starts picking through their camp,

3781
02:47:45.050 --> 02:47:46.058
and just looking through shit.

3782
02:47:46.058 --> 02:47:48.334
(laughter)

3783
02:47:48.334 --> 02:47:49.950
Well.
You know what?

3784
02:47:49.950 --> 02:47:52.610
I'm really proud of them.
They have made a change.

3785
02:47:52.610 --> 02:47:53.520
Yeah.
They've turned over

3786
02:47:53.520 --> 02:47:55.550
a new leaf.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

3787
02:47:55.550 --> 02:47:56.760
They look healthier.
They did.

3788
02:47:56.760 --> 02:47:58.010
Their clothes.
They looked,

3789
02:47:58.010 --> 02:48:00.170
yeah, they looked like they were eating good.

3790
02:48:00.170 --> 02:48:02.650
I assumed I'd have to cure somebody.

3791
02:48:02.650 --> 02:48:04.440
I heard terrible screaming and--

3792
02:48:04.440 --> 02:48:06.390
Nah, we got it handled.
Just going to cut off

3793
02:48:06.390 --> 02:48:08.580
lots of little pieces of meat for you to sprinkle.

3794
02:48:08.580 --> 02:48:11.019
You've got a little arrow.

3795
02:48:11.019 --> 02:48:13.500
Oh, yeah, they hit me a couple of times.

3796
02:48:13.500 --> 02:48:14.480
Oh, yeah.
Look at that.

3797
02:48:14.480 --> 02:48:15.990
Yeah, it's sticking out of my--

3798
02:48:15.990 --> 02:48:17.360
Can I--
Could be worse.

3799
02:48:17.360 --> 02:48:18.580
Yeah.
Yes, you can.

3800
02:48:18.580 --> 02:48:20.400
Okay.
(dice clattering)

3801
02:48:20.400 --> 02:48:21.310
Feces.

3802
02:48:21.310 --> 02:48:23.910
A, this would be what?
An investigation check,

3803
02:48:23.910 --> 02:48:25.250
we're using the--
Right.

3804
02:48:25.250 --> 02:48:26.556
That's a nine.
A nine.

3805
02:48:26.556 --> 02:48:27.479
(Beau laughing)
All right.

3806
02:48:27.479 --> 02:48:28.850
There are the carcasses.

3807
02:48:28.850 --> 02:48:30.560
Okay.
In which you

3808
02:48:30.560 --> 02:48:32.470
instinctually grab and one, and like (chomping).

3809
02:48:32.470 --> 02:48:33.303
Yeah.
Ew.

3810
02:48:35.090 --> 02:48:37.120
There's a collection of pelts, actually.

3811
02:48:37.120 --> 02:48:38.101
Oh.

3812
02:48:38.101 --> 02:48:42.290
And you can see the remnants of other hunting jobs

3813
02:48:42.290 --> 02:48:43.280
they're bringing with them.

3814
02:48:43.280 --> 02:48:45.460
Whether, you get the sense based on what they had,

3815
02:48:45.460 --> 02:48:47.950
they were in the process of heading back into some town.

3816
02:48:47.950 --> 02:48:50.170
Aw, I hope they come back.
To sell their wares.

3817
02:48:50.170 --> 02:48:52.240
Caleb puts a bunch of pelts on his head like a hat,

3818
02:48:52.240 --> 02:48:54.380
and then, just lumbers back to their campsite.

3819
02:48:54.380 --> 02:48:56.337
Okay. (laughs)

3820
02:48:56.337 --> 02:48:58.790
We're back.
How did that go?

3821
02:48:58.790 --> 02:49:00.410
It was fine.
Oh my gosh,

3822
02:49:00.410 --> 02:49:01.940
we ran into some old friends.

3823
02:49:01.940 --> 02:49:03.831
It was super fun.
You defused the situation

3824
02:49:03.831 --> 02:49:06.280
pretty well.
It was great.

3825
02:49:06.280 --> 02:49:08.330
We knew you had it so--
Into the night.

3826
02:49:08.330 --> 02:49:09.850
Did you see us?
Yeah, no, we thought

3827
02:49:09.850 --> 02:49:11.330
about intervening, and then, we realized

3828
02:49:11.330 --> 02:49:12.960
we didn't want to.
Do you remember

3829
02:49:12.960 --> 02:49:14.830
the Valley Bandits?
We do.

3830
02:49:14.830 --> 02:49:16.709
We met them again.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

3831
02:49:16.709 --> 02:49:18.870
(Caleb panting)
Caleb was an ape.

3832
02:49:18.870 --> 02:49:20.440
Caleb was there.
What's on your,

3833
02:49:20.440 --> 02:49:21.360
what's on his head?
(Caleb growling)

3834
02:49:21.360 --> 02:49:24.620
A hat.
Skin.

3835
02:49:24.620 --> 02:49:25.960
A hat.
He drapes it all

3836
02:49:25.960 --> 02:49:27.340
the way over Fjord, so you can't even see

3837
02:49:27.340 --> 02:49:28.510
his head anymore.
(laughter)

3838
02:49:28.510 --> 02:49:31.240
It's just a big bear pelt that's mostly tanned,

3839
02:49:31.240 --> 02:49:32.680
it's still a little damp in place.

3840
02:49:32.680 --> 02:49:34.266
It's very warm and disgusting.

3841
02:49:34.266 --> 02:49:35.880
Mm.
You know,

3842
02:49:35.880 --> 02:49:37.720
every time we see them, they're doing a little better.

3843
02:49:37.720 --> 02:49:40.860
Maybe next time we see them, they'll be running

3844
02:49:40.860 --> 02:49:43.020
a business--
Or have a store somewhere?

3845
02:49:43.020 --> 02:49:44.290
Yeah, how many were there?

3846
02:49:44.290 --> 02:49:46.330
We saw three, so it could've been more.

3847
02:49:46.330 --> 02:49:48.290
And you let them go, you didn't injure them

3848
02:49:48.290 --> 02:49:49.790
or kill any.
Well, Nott sort of

3849
02:49:49.790 --> 02:49:52.200
hurt one of them.
Oh.

3850
02:49:52.200 --> 02:49:54.362
I shot one with a--
We did see them running

3851
02:49:54.362 --> 02:49:57.289
away from you, so.
That was because of Caleb.

3852
02:49:57.289 --> 02:50:00.140
Oh.
(Caleb panting)

3853
02:50:00.140 --> 02:50:00.973
Well, that's good.

3854
02:50:00.973 --> 02:50:02.750
I'm you glad you probably stopped them from thieving,

3855
02:50:02.750 --> 02:50:04.190
right, they were probably doing something illegal.

3856
02:50:04.190 --> 02:50:06.430
They said, they actually freely admitted

3857
02:50:06.430 --> 02:50:08.960
to have done some bad things.
Right.

3858
02:50:08.960 --> 02:50:11.640
But no more than we do bad things, you know?

3859
02:50:11.640 --> 02:50:12.980
Hmm.
Yes.

3860
02:50:12.980 --> 02:50:15.660
They were just, this was an honest thing

3861
02:50:15.660 --> 02:50:17.020
that they were doing here tonight,

3862
02:50:17.020 --> 02:50:18.680
that we scared them away from doing.

3863
02:50:18.680 --> 02:50:20.140
Yeah, and stole their pelts that they were--

3864
02:50:20.140 --> 02:50:22.040
But it's like the Scared Straight program.

3865
02:50:22.040 --> 02:50:24.160
You know, we just keep scaring them,

3866
02:50:24.160 --> 02:50:25.960
and eventually, they'll go straight.

3867
02:50:27.690 --> 02:50:28.600
Okay.
Does that--

3868
02:50:28.600 --> 02:50:30.210
Okay, I don't, yeah.

3869
02:50:30.210 --> 02:50:32.820
I think I read records about that never working.

3870
02:50:33.880 --> 02:50:36.970
Well, we're trying.
(laughter)

3871
02:50:36.970 --> 02:50:38.410
Can we go see--
Yeah.

3872
02:50:38.410 --> 02:50:40.900
Yes, feel free.
Sorry about that, Fjord.

3873
02:50:40.900 --> 02:50:42.210
All right.

3874
02:50:42.210 --> 02:50:44.310
Caleb starts recreating the hut.

3875
02:50:44.310 --> 02:50:45.570
Fair enough.

3876
02:50:45.570 --> 02:50:48.030
This evening's rest is far more uneventful

3877
02:50:48.030 --> 02:50:50.340
as the campfire in the distance slowly peters

3878
02:50:50.340 --> 02:50:52.250
to a darkness.
They probably would've

3879
02:50:52.250 --> 02:50:54.050
wandered in here, you know?

3880
02:50:54.050 --> 02:50:55.250
For sure.
Tried to see

3881
02:50:55.250 --> 02:50:56.650
what was going on.
Not a chance.

3882
02:50:56.650 --> 02:50:57.980
They would never have noticed us.

3883
02:50:57.980 --> 02:50:59.920
They're not that talented.

3884
02:50:59.920 --> 02:51:00.753
All right.
Well, I mean,

3885
02:51:00.753 --> 02:51:03.820
in case, they would've noticed us,

3886
02:51:03.820 --> 02:51:06.080
you certainly took care of the problem.

3887
02:51:06.080 --> 02:51:08.310
That's true.
Well done.

3888
02:51:08.310 --> 02:51:11.660
We do have, lots of horses sitting right outside

3889
02:51:11.660 --> 02:51:13.995
of our bubble, so--
They could've taken

3890
02:51:13.995 --> 02:51:15.850
the horses, yep.

3891
02:51:15.850 --> 02:51:17.450
That really felt like there was a lesson here,

3892
02:51:17.450 --> 02:51:19.870
and I'm pretty sure we haven't learned it.

3893
02:51:19.870 --> 02:51:23.270
To protect Toilet Jr. and Crapper Jr.

3894
02:51:23.270 --> 02:51:25.180
Oh, that's right.
John, Jr.

3895
02:51:25.180 --> 02:51:28.580
Old W.C.
Good ol' W.C., J.R.

3896
02:51:30.700 --> 02:51:31.937
Are those the horses' names?

3897
02:51:31.937 --> 02:51:34.632
Yeah.
They are now.

3898
02:51:34.632 --> 02:51:36.382
(laughter)
That's, yeah.

3899
02:51:38.290 --> 02:51:42.230
Evening is uneventful, rest comes easy.

3900
02:51:42.230 --> 02:51:43.490
The next morning, bright and early,

3901
02:51:43.490 --> 02:51:45.750
the warmth of the sun would've hit you,

3902
02:51:45.750 --> 02:51:48.170
if you weren't inside the dome when it begins

3903
02:51:48.170 --> 02:51:51.050
to grow warm, but however, the dome does eventually fade

3904
02:51:51.050 --> 02:51:54.630
and you all come to have your morning meal

3905
02:51:54.630 --> 02:51:56.330
before stepping onto your horses, and continuing again.

3906
02:51:56.330 --> 02:51:58.410
Are you casting Find the Path again?

3907
02:51:58.410 --> 02:52:00.360
Oh, that is a 6th level spell,

3908
02:52:00.360 --> 02:52:01.907
what do you guys think?
Yeah, do it.

3909
02:52:01.907 --> 02:52:03.480
Oh, man, all right.

3910
02:52:03.480 --> 02:52:05.640
Where is it lead you to now?

3911
02:52:07.809 --> 02:52:10.620
To the Isharnai, the Pri--
Okay.

3912
02:52:10.620 --> 02:52:12.630
Nope, wait, wait, we're going straight to her?

3913
02:52:12.630 --> 02:52:14.890
We're not going to go to Beau's dad?

3914
02:52:14.890 --> 02:52:17.080
Kamordah?
Oh.

3915
02:52:17.080 --> 02:52:19.270
I just figured if we could go straight to her.

3916
02:52:19.270 --> 02:52:20.103
Do we know where she is?

3917
02:52:20.103 --> 02:52:21.940
We don't where she is?

3918
02:52:21.940 --> 02:52:23.840
We're going--
The spell will probably

3919
02:52:23.840 --> 02:52:25.430
take you there.
Oh, I thought it had to be

3920
02:52:25.430 --> 02:52:27.620
a place that you know.
Does it, Caleb?

3921
02:52:27.620 --> 02:52:28.650
I think it does.

3922
02:52:28.650 --> 02:52:30.950
No, it says, that you're familiar with.

3923
02:52:30.950 --> 02:52:31.850
You don't know where she lives.

3924
02:52:31.850 --> 02:52:33.030
But you, well, she scryed on it,

3925
02:52:33.030 --> 02:52:34.900
so she would know--
You know the location?

3926
02:52:34.900 --> 02:52:36.940
I'm familiar with it.
Oh, with the place, oh.

3927
02:52:36.940 --> 02:52:38.240
So we're shortcutting us.

3928
02:52:38.240 --> 02:52:39.510
Great.
I thought we were going to go,

3929
02:52:39.510 --> 02:52:40.890
I thought we were going there

3930
02:52:40.890 --> 02:52:41.723
just to get--
But yeah,

3931
02:52:41.723 --> 02:52:42.870
that makes sense.
A little more data.

3932
02:52:42.870 --> 02:52:45.290
We should probably do that first.

3933
02:52:45.290 --> 02:52:46.550
Up to you.
Yeah.

3934
02:52:48.134 --> 02:52:49.584
I don't know what to do.
Beau.

3935
02:52:49.584 --> 02:52:52.100
I mean, if we need further confirmation,

3936
02:52:52.100 --> 02:52:53.820
we only have this name from a book.

3937
02:52:53.820 --> 02:52:56.420
That's not necessarily that we need confirmation.

3938
02:52:56.420 --> 02:52:57.450
I'd like to--
Fjord is going

3939
02:52:57.450 --> 02:52:59.460
to make a choice for us.
Beau's house.

3940
02:52:59.460 --> 02:53:00.293
Yeah.
We're going to

3941
02:53:00.293 --> 02:53:01.126
Beau's house, right?
Yeah.

3942
02:53:01.126 --> 02:53:03.060
Because we are assuming that that woman is the same--

3943
02:53:03.060 --> 02:53:05.840
The same woman.
We're pretty sure,

3944
02:53:05.840 --> 02:53:08.040
but I would also like to know what

3945
02:53:08.040 --> 02:53:10.470
we're really dealing with, which we don't really know.

3946
02:53:10.470 --> 02:53:12.560
To Maison Lionett!

3947
02:53:12.560 --> 02:53:14.030
Yeah, let's go to--
We need some firsthand--

3948
02:53:14.030 --> 02:53:15.760
So we don't need the Find the Path for that.

3949
02:53:15.760 --> 02:53:16.740
You know where we're going.

3950
02:53:16.740 --> 02:53:19.400
Yeah, more or less.

3951
02:53:19.400 --> 02:53:21.040
We are out in the middle of nowhere right now.

3952
02:53:21.040 --> 02:53:24.941
That way's north, so where do we go if that is north?

3953
02:53:24.941 --> 02:53:26.540
West.
East?

3954
02:53:26.540 --> 02:53:29.460
You made this journey a number of times in your youth.

3955
02:53:29.460 --> 02:53:31.410
You know how to guide them to Kamordah.

3956
02:53:31.410 --> 02:53:33.570
You, well--
Looking for a fight,

3957
02:53:33.570 --> 02:53:35.852
it's all muscle memory at this point.

3958
02:53:35.852 --> 02:53:38.666
All right.
One to one west, north.

3959
02:53:38.666 --> 02:53:42.720
Well, it--
A diamond, a diamond.

3960
02:53:44.520 --> 02:53:46.690
We get it, you have a baby.

3961
02:53:46.690 --> 02:53:47.523
Sorry.
(laughter)

3962
02:53:47.523 --> 02:53:48.356
No, I'm just playing.

3963
02:53:50.080 --> 02:53:53.270
Yeah.
(laughter)

3964
02:53:54.210 --> 02:53:55.550
The horses just take off running.

3965
02:53:55.550 --> 02:53:57.040
We're not going to go at all.

3966
02:53:57.040 --> 02:53:59.100
Yasha.
Goddamn, Beau,

3967
02:53:59.100 --> 02:54:01.580
we're not even ready to go.

3968
02:54:01.580 --> 02:54:02.910
I love it, I love it.

3969
02:54:02.910 --> 02:54:06.640
Lost an hour.
Packs up the food, yeah.

3970
02:54:06.640 --> 02:54:09.320
The second day of travel, along the path,

3971
02:54:09.320 --> 02:54:11.940
guided by Beauregard, also uneventful.

3972
02:54:14.260 --> 02:54:18.270
You do see occasionally some couriers on horseback,

3973
02:54:18.270 --> 02:54:21.190
riding quickly across the southern road.

3974
02:54:21.190 --> 02:54:23.130
Most of them travel upon the Bromkiln Byway

3975
02:54:23.130 --> 02:54:27.030
but you guys have taken the path separately

3976
02:54:27.030 --> 02:54:29.780
that heads to the Bromkiln Hills and Kamordah directly,

3977
02:54:29.780 --> 02:54:31.970
based on the direction the spell took you,

3978
02:54:31.970 --> 02:54:33.220
to cut off a little bit of time.

3979
02:54:33.220 --> 02:54:34.053
You can take the road.

3980
02:54:34.053 --> 02:54:35.180
The road is generally considered safer,

3981
02:54:35.180 --> 02:54:36.880
if people can't defend themselves.

3982
02:54:37.750 --> 02:54:39.560
But you guys generally don't have to worry

3983
02:54:39.560 --> 02:54:43.160
too much about that, so cutting the corners on this,

3984
02:54:43.160 --> 02:54:45.160
you come to the second night's rest.

3985
02:54:46.130 --> 02:54:48.530
You set up the camp.
Mm-hmm.

3986
02:54:49.410 --> 02:54:52.430
And the evening comes to claim you for a night of sleep.

3987
02:54:53.730 --> 02:54:55.160
In the middle of the night,

3988
02:54:55.160 --> 02:54:58.770
Caleb is not sleeping too well.

3989
02:54:58.770 --> 02:55:01.060
Mm-hmm.
And looks over at Yasha.

3990
02:55:05.025 --> 02:55:07.025
I don't like sleeping.

3991
02:55:09.890 --> 02:55:11.040
You don't sleep easy?

3992
02:55:14.713 --> 02:55:18.170
I seem to be not very good at it lately.

3993
02:55:20.130 --> 02:55:21.830
Some nights have been easier, but,

3994
02:55:27.763 --> 02:55:30.596
I sometimes don't like to go sleep

3995
02:55:31.487 --> 02:55:34.710
and possibly dream, you know?

3996
02:55:37.910 --> 02:55:40.470
You have not been yourself for awhile?

3997
02:55:44.000 --> 02:55:44.833
Yeah.

3998
02:55:46.470 --> 02:55:50.350
I guess I'm trying to figure out what that is right now.

3999
02:55:56.210 --> 02:55:59.440
Things just feel a little weird,

4000
02:55:59.440 --> 02:56:04.440
but I'm getting through it. (sighing)

4001
02:56:04.770 --> 02:56:07.570
(eerie music)
It's fresh.

4002
02:56:11.090 --> 02:56:11.923
Yeah.

4003
02:56:13.523 --> 02:56:16.440
(melancholy music)

4004
02:56:23.636 --> 02:56:25.427
I hope I'm not being too forward

4005
02:56:30.640 --> 02:56:32.030
in asking you this, but,

4006
02:56:36.640 --> 02:56:37.840
how do you deal with it?

4007
02:56:44.310 --> 02:56:46.450
I--
Is it that obvious?

4008
02:56:51.195 --> 02:56:52.845
I guess from someone who knows.

4009
02:57:00.920 --> 02:57:03.300
I've only heard things about,

4010
02:57:06.740 --> 02:57:07.640
your past, but.

4011
02:57:10.910 --> 02:57:11.743
Mm.

4012
02:57:12.600 --> 02:57:14.430
We don't have to talk about it.

4013
02:57:14.430 --> 02:57:17.510
I just.
Nott?

4014
02:57:22.610 --> 02:57:27.520
Yeah, I don't remember, actually.

4015
02:57:27.520 --> 02:57:32.520
Nott.

4016
02:57:39.120 --> 02:57:40.820
Sometimes, I feel like two people.

4017
02:57:44.370 --> 02:57:45.420
I'm better with them,

4018
02:57:47.950 --> 02:57:48.910
and one of me is,

4019
02:57:57.905 --> 02:57:59.110
my thing is old.

4020
02:58:02.510 --> 02:58:04.170
So I guess I'm accustomed to it.

4021
02:58:05.155 --> 02:58:07.655
(tense music)

4022
02:58:12.010 --> 02:58:15.400
I thought that we were similar when we first met.

4023
02:58:15.400 --> 02:58:20.050
It's not just, it's not just Obann.

4024
02:58:24.500 --> 02:58:25.850
You have blood in your eye.

4025
02:58:30.670 --> 02:58:31.503
Yeah.

4026
02:58:44.840 --> 02:58:45.673
I'm sorry.

4027
02:58:47.320 --> 02:58:48.320
Why are you sorry?

4028
02:59:02.654 --> 02:59:04.873
I see a hesitation and regret in you.

4029
02:59:07.520 --> 02:59:08.720
And it is like a mirror.

4030
02:59:13.590 --> 02:59:15.390
I know regret, and I regret,

4031
02:59:20.230 --> 02:59:21.063
I regret,

4032
02:59:26.104 --> 02:59:27.904
and unless my intuition is very off,

4033
02:59:31.730 --> 02:59:32.563
you know regret.

4034
02:59:37.880 --> 02:59:39.110
So it never goes away?

4035
02:59:46.070 --> 02:59:46.903
No.

4036
02:59:55.778 --> 02:59:58.390
But, it's easier with people around you,

4037
03:00:05.370 --> 03:00:06.920
to make you feel more like you.

4038
03:00:16.264 --> 03:00:17.614
I feel a little bit like,

4039
03:00:22.830 --> 03:00:25.150
the forgiveness is almost harder to deal with.

4040
03:00:29.840 --> 03:00:31.090
I feel like anger is

4041
03:00:34.370 --> 03:00:35.913
an emotion that I know

4042
03:00:40.170 --> 03:00:42.470
how to deal with, because that's where I live.

4043
03:00:43.536 --> 03:00:46.560
(woman vocalizing)
(eerie music)

4044
03:00:46.560 --> 03:00:47.393
But I feel like,

4045
03:00:52.180 --> 03:00:54.800
with everyone being so nice and accepting,

4046
03:00:54.800 --> 03:00:56.300
I don't know how to handle it.

4047
03:01:07.140 --> 03:01:11.670
I know I'm not handling it well, but I'm trying.

4048
03:01:16.330 --> 03:01:19.539
Caleb is spinning a diamond over and over and over

4049
03:01:19.539 --> 03:01:22.410
and over and over and over and over in his hand.

4050
03:01:26.680 --> 03:01:27.730
I don't think we can.

4051
03:01:35.691 --> 03:01:38.593
But, when we are never going to wash our hands,

4052
03:01:39.580 --> 03:01:44.580
we can use them to leave something better in the world,

4053
03:01:50.941 --> 03:01:54.300
and maybe the curtain never rises from our eyes,

4054
03:01:54.300 --> 03:01:58.050
but what else do we do?

4055
03:02:02.790 --> 03:02:06.370
You either lose yourself to it, and forget,

4056
03:02:10.870 --> 03:02:11.870
or you do your part.

4057
03:02:22.093 --> 03:02:26.093
They're pretty, and he looks around at them all,

4058
03:02:28.010 --> 03:02:28.990
they're pretty great.

4059
03:02:32.306 --> 03:02:33.406
We don't deserve them.

4060
03:02:43.153 --> 03:02:44.653
Do you love her?

4061
03:02:53.200 --> 03:02:54.033
Who?

4062
03:02:58.260 --> 03:02:59.810
I don't need to tell you who.

4063
03:03:10.230 --> 03:03:11.130
I'm sorry, I,

4064
03:03:18.599 --> 03:03:20.370
as someone who has lost someone

4065
03:03:20.370 --> 03:03:24.750
that they love very much,

4066
03:03:24.750 --> 03:03:28.720
I know how important it is to say things

4067
03:03:28.720 --> 03:03:30.010
before it is too late.

4068
03:03:37.390 --> 03:03:38.540
It's too late, Yasha.

4069
03:03:41.820 --> 03:03:42.653
It's not.

4070
03:03:53.390 --> 03:03:54.590
Maybe not, I don't know.

4071
03:03:56.820 --> 03:03:58.670
You reach out just a hand and just,

4072
03:04:00.290 --> 03:04:02.660
look away and pat the top of her hand, and then,

4073
03:04:04.480 --> 03:04:06.920
curl up and face the outside of the dome.

4074
03:04:12.055 --> 03:04:14.555
I just sort of stay sitting up and watching him.

4075
03:04:18.180 --> 03:04:19.780
There's a flash in the distance.

4076
03:04:24.370 --> 03:04:25.720
Another one a moment later.

4077
03:04:29.644 --> 03:04:30.800
There is a storm brewing.

4078
03:04:37.120 --> 03:04:37.953
It's comforting.

4079
03:04:44.794 --> 03:04:46.644
I close my eyes and I try to sleep.

4080
03:04:51.631 --> 03:04:53.330
(ethereal music)

4081
03:04:53.330 --> 03:04:56.650
The morning eventually comes for you all.

4082
03:04:58.660 --> 03:05:02.830
As the spell fades, and the morning sun

4083
03:05:02.830 --> 03:05:05.290
does not peek through, as the previous morning did.

4084
03:05:05.290 --> 03:05:07.960
Instead, as the dome begins to fade,

4085
03:05:08.850 --> 03:05:13.720
the wet rain begins to suddenly fill the space,

4086
03:05:13.720 --> 03:05:15.310
and you all rapidly grab your things,

4087
03:05:15.310 --> 03:05:16.650
and start bundling it up quickly.

4088
03:05:16.650 --> 03:05:17.483
Oh, ugh.

4089
03:05:22.347 --> 03:05:23.180
It's probably

4090
03:05:23.180 --> 03:05:24.013
going to be raining.
Are we almost there, Beau?

4091
03:05:24.013 --> 03:05:24.846
Are we almost there?

4092
03:05:24.846 --> 03:05:28.390
We're going to be riding in this shit all fucking day.

4093
03:05:30.550 --> 03:05:32.940
It's going to take the rest of the day, right?

4094
03:05:32.940 --> 03:05:33.940
For the most part.

4095
03:05:36.070 --> 03:05:38.620
All right, this is going to suck, let's go.

4096
03:05:40.850 --> 03:05:41.700
Yeah!

4097
03:05:41.700 --> 03:05:44.460
Yeah.
(laughter)

4098
03:05:44.460 --> 03:05:46.540
Getting back on the horseback,

4099
03:05:46.540 --> 03:05:48.870
continuing to follow Beauregard's lead across

4100
03:05:49.940 --> 03:05:52.010
the Truscan Vale, ignoring the roads,

4101
03:05:52.010 --> 03:05:54.280
onwards towards the Bromkiln Hills.

4102
03:05:55.770 --> 03:05:58.020
Most of the day progresses,

4103
03:05:58.020 --> 03:06:00.090
all of you getting bundled with your cloaks

4104
03:06:00.090 --> 03:06:02.800
and materials close, to maintain heat,

4105
03:06:03.719 --> 03:06:05.110
and as as much dryness as you can,

4106
03:06:05.110 --> 03:06:08.460
though elements of the rain seep into your boots,

4107
03:06:08.460 --> 03:06:11.440
you can feel the moisture causing your skin to clam within.

4108
03:06:13.760 --> 03:06:16.860
Looking up ahead, you can see the mountain range

4109
03:06:16.860 --> 03:06:19.910
of this side of the Cyrios Mountains

4110
03:06:19.910 --> 03:06:22.650
beginning to grow larger and larger,

4111
03:06:23.800 --> 03:06:28.550
until you begin to see the greenish grassy plains

4112
03:06:28.550 --> 03:06:30.650
of the Truscan Vale begin to give way

4113
03:06:30.650 --> 03:06:32.020
to a different coloration.

4114
03:06:33.310 --> 03:06:36.100
The grass has begun to become duller,

4115
03:06:37.470 --> 03:06:42.250
brown and yellow in places, and as you reach

4116
03:06:42.250 --> 03:06:44.930
the beginning of the Bromkiln Hills themselves,

4117
03:06:44.930 --> 03:06:46.540
you can see already, not beyond,

4118
03:06:46.540 --> 03:06:49.450
just that the hills getting larger and oddly shaped,

4119
03:06:49.450 --> 03:06:53.640
but the landscape go from patches of completely lack

4120
03:06:53.640 --> 03:06:57.180
of vegetation, where it's just cracked ground and mud,

4121
03:06:57.180 --> 03:07:00.530
to areas where you can see all manner of strange colored

4122
03:07:02.500 --> 03:07:06.170
earth and mud and minerals beginning to emerge

4123
03:07:06.170 --> 03:07:08.560
from what look almost like small steam vents

4124
03:07:08.560 --> 03:07:10.690
that rise from the ground.

4125
03:07:14.700 --> 03:07:16.570
As you begin to--
We're close.

4126
03:07:16.570 --> 03:07:17.970
This is where you grew up?

4127
03:07:19.390 --> 03:07:20.450
Shitty, right?

4128
03:07:20.450 --> 03:07:21.900
Doesn't look like farmland.

4129
03:07:23.310 --> 03:07:24.143
Exactly.

4130
03:07:28.570 --> 03:07:31.830
Heading towards the outskirts of Kamordah,

4131
03:07:31.830 --> 03:07:35.200
as you crest one of the hills, begin to see

4132
03:07:35.200 --> 03:07:40.200
in the later hours of the day, not quite nearing sunrise yet

4133
03:07:41.110 --> 03:07:43.020
but dark enough where the clouds remain overhead

4134
03:07:43.020 --> 03:07:47.910
that you can see the lights of all the interior lit homes

4135
03:07:47.910 --> 03:07:51.810
of the village, just begin to make their way

4136
03:07:51.810 --> 03:07:53.210
to your eyes on the horizon.

4137
03:07:54.580 --> 03:07:57.630
All around you, the smell changes, too.

4138
03:07:57.630 --> 03:07:59.500
As opposed to wet earth and grass,

4139
03:07:59.500 --> 03:08:02.640
you can smell strange minerals.

4140
03:08:02.640 --> 03:08:07.450
Some smells sweet and have almost like a jasmine

4141
03:08:07.450 --> 03:08:10.140
type pleasant smell to it,

4142
03:08:10.140 --> 03:08:15.140
and then, waves of heavy sulfur and other deep,

4143
03:08:15.330 --> 03:08:18.270
earth minerals emerging from the,

4144
03:08:18.270 --> 03:08:20.670
what you can now see around you, pockets of very heavy,

4145
03:08:20.670 --> 03:08:23.070
geothermal activity that seem to be brewing

4146
03:08:23.070 --> 03:08:25.190
through the nearby landscape.

4147
03:08:26.430 --> 03:08:29.230
You can see dozens and dozens of sorts of these vents,

4148
03:08:29.230 --> 03:08:30.863
just this gentle white mist

4149
03:08:30.863 --> 03:08:32.850
and every now and then, you'll see the small,

4150
03:08:32.850 --> 03:08:36.550
little geyser (hissing) emerge from spots.

4151
03:08:36.550 --> 03:08:39.010
Oh, is there a volcano around here?

4152
03:08:40.612 --> 03:08:42.880
I think one that used to be active a long time ago

4153
03:08:42.880 --> 03:08:47.360
in the mountains when, this whole landscape

4154
03:08:47.360 --> 03:08:50.450
is just filled with geothermal activity and steam vents.

4155
03:08:50.450 --> 03:08:53.340
Don't stick your hands into any of the water.

4156
03:08:53.340 --> 03:08:55.710
It will melt, it will slough right of your bones.

4157
03:08:55.710 --> 03:08:56.543
What?

4158
03:08:56.543 --> 03:08:59.420
Have you seen it happen?

4159
03:08:59.420 --> 03:09:01.340
No, just heard stories.

4160
03:09:01.340 --> 03:09:03.320
That sounds, Beau, have you seen it happen?

4161
03:09:03.320 --> 03:09:04.910
You lived around here.

4162
03:09:04.910 --> 03:09:08.290
We used to throw in snails and shit in there,

4163
03:09:08.290 --> 03:09:09.430
and see what would happen.

4164
03:09:09.430 --> 03:09:12.015
That was fun.
That's really fucked up.

4165
03:09:12.015 --> 03:09:15.540
Yeah, yeah.

4166
03:09:15.540 --> 03:09:16.380
We were kids.

4167
03:09:18.380 --> 03:09:20.840
But yeah, let's keep going, though.

4168
03:09:20.840 --> 03:09:23.540
How does Beau seem compared to how's she's normally?

4169
03:09:25.779 --> 03:09:27.670
Totally good, doing great.

4170
03:09:29.500 --> 03:09:30.380
Beau?
Awesome.

4171
03:09:30.380 --> 03:09:32.600
Yeah, blue skies.

4172
03:09:32.600 --> 03:09:34.580
How do you seem, Beau?

4173
03:09:34.580 --> 03:09:35.413
Anxious?

4174
03:09:36.300 --> 03:09:38.940
Barricaded behind emotional walls.

4175
03:09:40.053 --> 03:09:42.790
I'm trapped in a glass case of emotions.

4176
03:09:42.790 --> 03:09:43.820
There you go.
More closed off

4177
03:09:43.820 --> 03:09:46.390
than she's been in a while?
Yes.

4178
03:09:46.390 --> 03:09:47.860
Definitely.

4179
03:09:47.860 --> 03:09:49.820
If anything, it's shades of the first time

4180
03:09:49.820 --> 03:09:51.720
you guys met coming through.

4181
03:09:55.250 --> 03:09:56.780
Heading towards the outskirts of the city,

4182
03:09:56.780 --> 03:09:59.880
as you approach the actual town proper,

4183
03:09:59.880 --> 03:10:03.240
there are wrought iron gates and small stone walls

4184
03:10:03.240 --> 03:10:06.320
about waist to chest high in places.

4185
03:10:06.320 --> 03:10:08.520
The ground itself gives way to mud, a combination

4186
03:10:08.520 --> 03:10:12.400
of the recent weather, and just probably the strange,

4187
03:10:12.400 --> 03:10:15.730
ashen ground that makes up a lot of the town here.

4188
03:10:18.200 --> 03:10:21.880
Vineyards, you know that, and have heard

4189
03:10:21.880 --> 03:10:24.060
that fine wines come from here.

4190
03:10:24.060 --> 03:10:27.030
This is not a landscape that would be kind

4191
03:10:27.030 --> 03:10:31.470
to any sort of standard vineyard.

4192
03:10:33.950 --> 03:10:36.130
At the front of the city, there are a few

4193
03:10:36.130 --> 03:10:38.450
of the town's guard posted,

4194
03:10:38.450 --> 03:10:41.050
that just keep an eye as you approach,

4195
03:10:42.040 --> 03:10:45.130
careful and untrusting, but keeping to their space,

4196
03:10:45.130 --> 03:10:48.620
just looking over to each of you intently as you go.

4197
03:10:49.740 --> 03:10:51.040
How's the weather today?

4198
03:10:52.180 --> 03:10:53.020
Is it still rainy?

4199
03:10:53.020 --> 03:10:54.871
Oh, it's still rainy.
Yeah.

4200
03:10:54.871 --> 03:10:56.363
Okay.
Just gray.

4201
03:10:56.363 --> 03:11:01.363
It does not sound--
(laughter)

4202
03:11:01.600 --> 03:11:03.020
Yeah, the thunder and the lightning that rolled

4203
03:11:03.020 --> 03:11:06.450
through the night seems to have faded through the day,

4204
03:11:06.450 --> 03:11:09.560
but it is still raining pretty hard.

4205
03:11:10.880 --> 03:11:14.240
Heading inward, you can see, this is a town

4206
03:11:14.240 --> 03:11:19.240
built largely of pale rock and dull, petrified wood,

4207
03:11:20.420 --> 03:11:22.490
which you know is a lot of the forests in the mountains

4208
03:11:22.490 --> 03:11:24.660
surrounding here, some of it's very lush

4209
03:11:24.660 --> 03:11:28.010
from how rich, how mineral-rich a lot of the earth is,

4210
03:11:28.010 --> 03:11:30.700
and other areas are just died off,

4211
03:11:32.020 --> 03:11:35.960
since whatever altered this mountain range happened,

4212
03:11:35.960 --> 03:11:38.002
the lush forest that once carried it all

4213
03:11:38.002 --> 03:11:42.575
patches off and just, (squeaking) withered up,

4214
03:11:42.575 --> 03:11:45.610
and that becomes very cheap wood to build with.

4215
03:11:47.480 --> 03:11:48.940
So it's funny.

4216
03:11:48.940 --> 03:11:51.720
For as much as you hear about wealth and,

4217
03:11:51.720 --> 03:11:54.740
the Truscan Vale is known to be a rich area,

4218
03:11:54.740 --> 03:11:56.920
Deastok in particular, to the south.

4219
03:11:58.287 --> 03:12:00.840
This town, the elements that you're seeing is,

4220
03:12:00.840 --> 03:12:04.160
upon arriving, seem a little more ramshackle,

4221
03:12:04.160 --> 03:12:05.850
and in some ways, remind of Shadycreek Run,

4222
03:12:05.850 --> 03:12:08.620
though not as seedy, necessarily,

4223
03:12:08.620 --> 03:12:13.620
but definitely built for function over aesthetics.

4224
03:12:15.220 --> 03:12:18.820
A lot of people you can see bringing their work loads

4225
03:12:18.820 --> 03:12:21.530
through the streets, themselves hoods and cloaks up,

4226
03:12:21.530 --> 03:12:23.570
looking miserable in the weather,

4227
03:12:23.570 --> 03:12:25.820
shouting to each other and pulling materials through.

4228
03:12:25.820 --> 03:12:27.770
You can see carts exiting past you,

4229
03:12:27.770 --> 03:12:30.788
heading toward the southern side of the city as they leave,

4230
03:12:30.788 --> 03:12:35.100
a number of them carrying what look to be large barrels,

4231
03:12:36.060 --> 03:12:37.650
some of these exports on their way out,

4232
03:12:37.650 --> 03:12:40.190
and well-armed guards watching them as they go.

4233
03:12:41.450 --> 03:12:43.970
See how miserable everyone looks?

4234
03:12:43.970 --> 03:12:46.470
I mean, they're probably drunk,

4235
03:12:46.470 --> 03:12:48.490
because everyone's drunk on wine, right?

4236
03:12:48.490 --> 03:12:50.170
This is wine place.

4237
03:12:50.170 --> 03:12:51.460
Nah, it just sucks.

4238
03:12:52.500 --> 03:12:56.010
Caduceus, your homeland, it's, you said it was dying,

4239
03:12:56.010 --> 03:12:58.740
right, the nature was dying?

4240
03:12:58.740 --> 03:13:00.050
Is it like this?

4241
03:13:00.050 --> 03:13:01.940
Is this natural?
No.

4242
03:13:01.940 --> 03:13:03.760
No.
Because there are,

4243
03:13:05.420 --> 03:13:08.280
this is different, but it's still very alive,

4244
03:13:09.576 --> 03:13:10.600
it's just a different kind of alive.

4245
03:13:10.600 --> 03:13:13.270
Yeah, this is not the same.

4246
03:13:13.270 --> 03:13:16.050
Farmlands here passed from hand to hand

4247
03:13:16.050 --> 03:13:18.740
and farmer to farmer, and they kept selling it off

4248
03:13:18.740 --> 03:13:21.600
trying to get shit to grow, and of course,

4249
03:13:21.600 --> 03:13:25.410
they couldn't get anything to grow until my dad,

4250
03:13:25.410 --> 03:13:27.490
maybe a couple other farmers came in,

4251
03:13:28.560 --> 03:13:31.730
threw down some grapes, and it turns out

4252
03:13:31.730 --> 03:13:36.730
that the mineral-rich soil and the shitty weather

4253
03:13:37.979 --> 03:13:42.979
from all the ocean mist makes for some great fucking grapes.

4254
03:13:44.550 --> 03:13:46.510
Mm.
Grapes.

4255
03:13:46.510 --> 03:13:49.600
A lot of grapes, so many fucking grapes.

4256
03:13:51.260 --> 03:13:53.890
Right, all that stuff and some crazy old woman.

4257
03:13:54.860 --> 03:13:55.870
Yeah.

4258
03:13:55.870 --> 03:13:57.350
Passing through, you can see what you know

4259
03:13:57.350 --> 03:13:59.870
is the mud fields, which are an element

4260
03:13:59.870 --> 03:14:02.590
of a lower end residential town,

4261
03:14:02.590 --> 03:14:04.580
though it's not a slum, per se,

4262
03:14:04.580 --> 03:14:09.470
but it's just the standard workers' homesteads here.

4263
03:14:09.470 --> 03:14:13.850
The streets themselves just brown and mucky,

4264
03:14:13.850 --> 03:14:15.233
especially with all the water that's starting

4265
03:14:15.233 --> 03:14:16.450
to flood in some places.

4266
03:14:16.450 --> 03:14:17.900
You can see some folks are in the process

4267
03:14:17.900 --> 03:14:20.940
of currently taking buckets and making sure

4268
03:14:20.940 --> 03:14:23.690
that certain areas don't get too soggy.

4269
03:14:23.690 --> 03:14:27.670
You can see situated greenhouses that are arranged in places

4270
03:14:27.670 --> 03:14:29.780
that are enclosed entirely,

4271
03:14:29.780 --> 03:14:31.840
where it seems some semblance of green

4272
03:14:31.840 --> 03:14:34.800
is being maintained from the interior.

4273
03:14:34.800 --> 03:14:39.248
You know these people have brought soil from other locations

4274
03:14:39.248 --> 03:14:41.800
and have begun to try and find what other types

4275
03:14:41.800 --> 03:14:45.990
of vegetation do take to the landscape here,

4276
03:14:45.990 --> 03:14:50.990
and some do, not as profitable as wine is, and even then,

4277
03:14:51.720 --> 03:14:54.700
it's very selective of which patches of land do.

4278
03:14:54.700 --> 03:14:56.780
Making your way through the mud fields,

4279
03:14:56.780 --> 03:14:58.650
you eventually head towards what is called

4280
03:14:58.650 --> 03:15:03.100
the Rainbow Vineyards, which is along the base

4281
03:15:03.100 --> 03:15:07.220
of the mountains here that lead into the Cyrios Range.

4282
03:15:08.170 --> 03:15:10.580
There are these winding cliffs, and you can see

4283
03:15:10.580 --> 03:15:11.830
where they have carved walkways.

4284
03:15:11.830 --> 03:15:14.310
They go up the side, and there are buildings

4285
03:15:14.310 --> 03:15:16.880
held in, there are heavy ropes dangling

4286
03:15:16.880 --> 03:15:21.290
what looks to be where materials and goods are

4287
03:15:21.290 --> 03:15:23.290
brought down to lower elevation,

4288
03:15:23.290 --> 03:15:26.930
or carried up on high, as well as donkeys and horses

4289
03:15:26.930 --> 03:15:30.520
carrying things up these paths if need be.

4290
03:15:30.520 --> 03:15:33.900
You can see clusters and clusters of oddly colored

4291
03:15:35.710 --> 03:15:37.940
grape vines, all just set

4292
03:15:37.940 --> 03:15:39.520
upon the entire mountainside here.

4293
03:15:39.520 --> 03:15:42.910
And when I say mountainside, it visually is a mountainside,

4294
03:15:42.910 --> 03:15:44.710
but none like what you've seen.

4295
03:15:44.710 --> 03:15:47.520
There are layers and layers, and the colors transition

4296
03:15:47.520 --> 03:15:50.970
brightly from a dull gray to a bright yellow,

4297
03:15:50.970 --> 03:15:53.930
to almost a dripping orange in some locales.

4298
03:15:53.930 --> 03:15:58.060
There's areas where you can see pools of hot, hot water,

4299
03:15:58.060 --> 03:16:01.450
that are emerging in these puddles of mud,

4300
03:16:01.450 --> 03:16:02.990
where it's boiling, bubbling, and you can see

4301
03:16:02.990 --> 03:16:05.770
the coloration turning blue at the edges almost,

4302
03:16:05.770 --> 03:16:08.110
and around that edge, you can see cultivating

4303
03:16:08.110 --> 03:16:12.200
additional grape vines, and other strange, odd plants

4304
03:16:12.200 --> 03:16:13.160
that are starting to take into there,

4305
03:16:13.160 --> 03:16:16.330
all very carefully under watch, and very carefully guarded

4306
03:16:16.330 --> 03:16:18.290
and well-manned, and you get the sense

4307
03:16:18.290 --> 03:16:20.990
that there's probably a lot of the, well, at least,

4308
03:16:20.990 --> 03:16:24.130
a surprising section of this town makes its living

4309
03:16:24.130 --> 03:16:26.280
tending to vineyards here.

4310
03:16:27.130 --> 03:16:28.360
As they've been traveling through here,

4311
03:16:28.360 --> 03:16:30.970
Frumpkin the Raven goes (whooshing)

4312
03:16:30.970 --> 03:16:33.530
and lands on Beauregard's shoulder,

4313
03:16:33.530 --> 03:16:35.490
and not sharp or painful or hard at all,

4314
03:16:35.490 --> 03:16:40.490
but just, every once in awhile, gives a little (tapping),

4315
03:16:40.490 --> 03:16:43.212
and Caleb doesn't look at all, he's just face forward.

4316
03:16:43.212 --> 03:16:44.070
Okay.

4317
03:16:44.070 --> 03:16:45.010
What, Frumpkin?

4318
03:16:45.010 --> 03:16:47.480
Stop, stop.

4319
03:16:53.280 --> 03:16:57.810
You can feel the muscles of your back

4320
03:16:57.810 --> 03:17:02.810
and shoulders and neck, tightening and knotting

4321
03:17:03.310 --> 03:17:07.220
in a way that can remember experiencing.

4322
03:17:08.880 --> 03:17:12.270
The heat that's building along the back of your neck

4323
03:17:12.270 --> 03:17:14.560
and your spine is tremendous,

4324
03:17:14.560 --> 03:17:17.520
matching almost what you imagine the temperature

4325
03:17:17.520 --> 03:17:20.230
of these steam pits that are just slowly releasing,

4326
03:17:20.230 --> 03:17:22.630
the cold rain hitting, and the hot steam

4327
03:17:22.630 --> 03:17:24.087
being released from it.

4328
03:17:24.087 --> 03:17:27.190
For a moment, you feel almost like you're matching

4329
03:17:27.190 --> 03:17:28.040
that temperature.

4330
03:17:29.210 --> 03:17:31.330
As you guys crest up on one side

4331
03:17:31.330 --> 03:17:34.210
of the Rainbow Vineyards section, and you can see

4332
03:17:34.210 --> 03:17:38.120
the three story estate of the Lionett family,

4333
03:17:39.190 --> 03:17:40.190
lit from the inside.

4334
03:17:42.440 --> 03:17:43.273
Beau.

4335
03:17:46.680 --> 03:17:51.680
Whatever happens, he was an asshole for being mean to you.

4336
03:17:54.950 --> 03:17:56.280
You're a wonderful person.

4337
03:18:02.170 --> 03:18:03.890
You are a wonderful person.
Yeah, yeah.

4338
03:18:03.890 --> 03:18:05.700
You're a wonderful person.

4339
03:18:05.700 --> 03:18:07.800
He was lucky to have you for a daughter.

4340
03:18:08.900 --> 03:18:10.780
Hopefully, he will realize that now.

4341
03:18:12.780 --> 03:18:16.060
If he doesn't, remember what you told me.

4342
03:18:17.540 --> 03:18:19.800
Fuck them.
(Beau laughing)

4343
03:18:19.800 --> 03:18:23.100
You have us, and we love you so much, okay?

4344
03:18:26.230 --> 03:18:29.473
Thanks, Jes, and I give her a hug.

4345
03:18:35.257 --> 03:18:38.980
(sighing deeply) They added an arch.

4346
03:18:40.540 --> 03:18:42.420
It's even more pretentious now.

4347
03:18:42.420 --> 03:18:43.253
Okay, let's go.

4348
03:18:44.682 --> 03:18:46.560
Do we knock or call or--

4349
03:18:46.560 --> 03:18:49.030
There is a heavy gate on the outside,

4350
03:18:49.030 --> 03:18:50.220
with an arch in the front gate is,

4351
03:18:50.220 --> 03:18:53.490
it's replaced the familiar entrance to the house.

4352
03:18:55.320 --> 03:18:56.800
There's a little courtyard, where you can see

4353
03:18:56.800 --> 03:18:58.110
there have been some trees

4354
03:18:58.110 --> 03:19:00.490
and bushes that are tended to there.

4355
03:19:01.730 --> 03:19:03.850
The soil within the courtyard is different

4356
03:19:03.850 --> 03:19:07.031
from the soil surrounding, though you can see

4357
03:19:07.031 --> 03:19:10.650
even what's been placed supposedly to try and keep

4358
03:19:10.650 --> 03:19:14.420
the transplanted greenery intact is still browning

4359
03:19:14.420 --> 03:19:19.420
and graying, a failed experiment on making a nice grounds

4360
03:19:19.778 --> 03:19:23.360
around their home.
Are there any flowers?

4361
03:19:25.190 --> 03:19:26.850
No.

4362
03:19:26.850 --> 03:19:29.014
This is a flowerless place.

4363
03:19:29.014 --> 03:19:30.303
I was going to pick all of them.

4364
03:19:30.303 --> 03:19:31.550
(laughter)

4365
03:19:31.550 --> 03:19:34.430
As we're approaching, is there anyone on the roof,

4366
03:19:34.430 --> 03:19:36.730
guarding the wall?
Make a perception check.

4367
03:19:38.689 --> 03:19:41.260
(dice clattering)

4368
03:19:41.260 --> 03:19:42.450
10.

4369
03:19:42.450 --> 03:19:45.070
10.
(laughter)

4370
03:19:45.070 --> 03:19:47.320
It's hard to tell at this distance,

4371
03:19:47.320 --> 03:19:49.040
and as the light gets darker,

4372
03:19:49.040 --> 03:19:53.014
at this point, you can sense now from just the slow

4373
03:19:53.014 --> 03:19:55.614
shift in brightness that you're probably

4374
03:19:55.614 --> 03:20:00.190
about half an hour from dusk.
It's all that sulfur.

4375
03:20:04.030 --> 03:20:06.430
But you would know that there's usually,

4376
03:20:07.351 --> 03:20:11.850
at any give point in time, two folks patrolling

4377
03:20:11.850 --> 03:20:13.860
the grounds, just to ensure that nothing happens

4378
03:20:13.860 --> 03:20:15.450
to the family or the business.

4379
03:20:15.450 --> 03:20:17.500
Yeah.
Natch.

4380
03:20:17.500 --> 03:20:19.980
The gate is there, it's locked,

4381
03:20:19.980 --> 03:20:23.160
but you know one of many tricks to get by it.

4382
03:20:25.250 --> 03:20:27.140
So you just walk up to the lock,

4383
03:20:29.090 --> 03:20:32.440
we'll say one of the pin materials that you often use

4384
03:20:32.440 --> 03:20:34.390
to keep your hair up, you just quickly,

4385
03:20:35.405 --> 03:20:37.080
and the lock just goes (squeaking).

4386
03:20:37.080 --> 03:20:38.590
I think I have a lock picking kit.

4387
03:20:38.590 --> 03:20:40.303
Probably.
I still have one, yeah.

4388
03:20:40.303 --> 03:20:41.864
Blackwood sword.
Yeah.

4389
03:20:41.864 --> 03:20:45.430
(players talking over each other)

4390
03:20:45.430 --> 03:20:47.180
Just give it a condescending look.

4391
03:20:47.180 --> 03:20:50.420
There is a hitching post just outside,

4392
03:20:50.420 --> 03:20:54.490
or say three hitching posts right there for travelers,

4393
03:20:54.490 --> 03:20:56.030
you can leave the horses there.

4394
03:20:58.570 --> 03:20:59.770
After you, Beauregard.

4395
03:21:01.650 --> 03:21:04.410
If you want us to attack anyone at all,

4396
03:21:04.410 --> 03:21:06.410
just say, "Armadillo."

4397
03:21:06.410 --> 03:21:07.600
"Armadillo," got it.

4398
03:21:09.280 --> 03:21:11.365
Armadillo
Armadillo.

4399
03:21:11.365 --> 03:21:12.940
Okay.

4400
03:21:15.090 --> 03:21:15.923
Let's go.

4401
03:21:17.180 --> 03:21:18.710
Do you want us with you?

4402
03:21:18.710 --> 03:21:19.960
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

4403
03:21:20.870 --> 03:21:22.970
I rolled deep, that looks fucking awesome.

4404
03:21:24.050 --> 03:21:26.800
You're charge in us, you're the leader of the group.

4405
03:21:26.800 --> 03:21:27.650
Cool, cool, cool?

4406
03:21:28.820 --> 03:21:30.520
It's fine, it's fine, it's fine.

4407
03:21:31.710 --> 03:21:32.740
Okay, let's go.

4408
03:21:32.740 --> 03:21:34.040
Okay.

4409
03:21:34.040 --> 03:21:38.170
As you guys all begin to walk along the central pathway

4410
03:21:38.170 --> 03:21:41.180
where some of the first cobblestones you've seen,

4411
03:21:44.240 --> 03:21:47.390
you glancing at a fork, can see on the second floor,

4412
03:21:47.390 --> 03:21:49.885
there is a railing, and there is a cloaked, hooded figure

4413
03:21:49.885 --> 03:21:52.130
with a crossbow just leaning on the edge,

4414
03:21:52.130 --> 03:21:54.810
not aimed at you, but just watches you carefully,

4415
03:21:54.810 --> 03:21:56.640
and intentionally making his presence

4416
03:21:56.640 --> 03:22:00.840
known as you approach, in a way that guards do

4417
03:22:00.840 --> 03:22:03.380
oh so subtly when they're hired hands.

4418
03:22:04.730 --> 03:22:06.480
Coming to the familiar front door,

4419
03:22:06.480 --> 03:22:10.000
you can see there is a bit of a, a frosted

4420
03:22:10.000 --> 03:22:13.120
glass window, in the front, that gives a little bit

4421
03:22:13.120 --> 03:22:14.370
of light from the inside.

4422
03:22:15.360 --> 03:22:18.990
The heavy metal knocker sits resting, familiar.

4423
03:22:24.109 --> 03:22:26.720
(Matt beatboxing)
(laughter)

4424
03:22:26.720 --> 03:22:30.086
It's very cool.
(laughter)

4425
03:22:30.086 --> 03:22:31.690
And you hear, poof.

4426
03:22:31.690 --> 03:22:32.920
It's on a delay, yeah.

4427
03:22:32.920 --> 03:22:35.643
We need to change the batteries on my--

4428
03:22:35.643 --> 03:22:36.476
Yeah.

4429
03:22:36.476 --> 03:22:41.419
(Fjord imitating slow motion voice)

4430
03:22:41.419 --> 03:22:44.743
A moment passes, and then, you hear the, (clicking)

4431
03:22:44.743 --> 03:22:46.710
(squeaking) and the door opens,

4432
03:22:46.710 --> 03:22:48.650
and you see a woman standing there.

4433
03:22:50.920 --> 03:22:55.920
Probably early 30s, hair just tied back.

4434
03:22:57.890 --> 03:23:01.180
She's wearing not upper-class clothing,

4435
03:23:01.180 --> 03:23:03.570
more just like a worker or a servant outfit.

4436
03:23:05.660 --> 03:23:06.760
Hello, can I help you?

4437
03:23:08.010 --> 03:23:09.880
Do I know who she is?
You do not recognize her.

4438
03:23:09.880 --> 03:23:11.569
Is it your mom?
Stepmom.

4439
03:23:11.569 --> 03:23:13.520
Oh, okay.
No.

4440
03:23:13.520 --> 03:23:15.970
My mom is way more garish in the way she dresses.

4441
03:23:20.400 --> 03:23:25.010
Is the lady or man of the house here today?

4442
03:23:26.342 --> 03:23:29.250
(chuckling) Oh, may I ask who's inquiring?

4443
03:23:33.100 --> 03:23:34.150
Beauregard Lionett.

4444
03:23:39.810 --> 03:23:41.120
Oh, um.

4445
03:23:43.600 --> 03:23:47.440
I'm afraid the master is tending to the vineyard

4446
03:23:47.440 --> 03:23:48.273
at the moment.

4447
03:23:48.273 --> 03:23:50.160
He'll probably be back shortly for dinner.

4448
03:23:50.160 --> 03:23:53.350
But Ms. Lionett is inside.

4449
03:23:55.550 --> 03:23:57.990
Please, please, enter.

4450
03:23:57.990 --> 03:23:58.950
Oh, shit.

4451
03:24:00.160 --> 03:24:02.060
She opens the door.
What's wrong?

4452
03:24:03.050 --> 03:24:06.840
Beau, what if your dad recognizes my voice?

4453
03:24:06.840 --> 03:24:09.240
He probably will.
Just change your voice.

4454
03:24:09.240 --> 03:24:10.185
I'm just going to change my voice.

4455
03:24:10.185 --> 03:24:12.730
I wouldn't worry.
I'm just going to make--

4456
03:24:12.730 --> 03:24:16.063
It's fine, yeah, don't worry about it.

4457
03:24:19.230 --> 03:24:21.820
She steps to the side and,

4458
03:24:21.820 --> 03:24:23.290
just nods her head a little bit of like,

4459
03:24:23.290 --> 03:24:25.040
I had no idea, I am so sorry.

4460
03:24:26.450 --> 03:24:30.410
Looking inside, it is warm, it's inviting,

4461
03:24:30.410 --> 03:24:31.720
especially in the cold rain,

4462
03:24:31.720 --> 03:24:34.150
but as you step inside, and kick off your muddy boots

4463
03:24:34.150 --> 03:24:36.290
or not, depending on how you feel about it,

4464
03:24:38.900 --> 03:24:40.330
immediately, here in this foyer area,

4465
03:24:40.330 --> 03:24:43.720
you can see it has a beautiful rustic aesthetic.

4466
03:24:43.720 --> 03:24:48.020
There are antlers on the wall.

4467
03:24:48.020 --> 03:24:52.630
You can see, it's like a dark mahogany wood interior

4468
03:24:52.630 --> 03:24:56.060
lined with a brighter wood used to set

4469
03:24:56.060 --> 03:24:57.350
the walls apart.

4470
03:24:57.350 --> 03:25:00.280
There is a staircase that goes to a second landing

4471
03:25:00.280 --> 03:25:02.310
that wraps around the main foyer area,

4472
03:25:02.310 --> 03:25:05.270
and there is a iron chandelier that sits in the middle

4473
03:25:05.270 --> 03:25:09.420
that is circular with magically-held candles

4474
03:25:09.420 --> 03:25:12.370
that just keep a constant, nice glow there.

4475
03:25:13.250 --> 03:25:14.450
This is nice.
Yeah.

4476
03:25:16.690 --> 03:25:18.370
You can, the servant closes the door behind you,

4477
03:25:18.370 --> 03:25:20.250
and then, rushes off.

4478
03:25:20.250 --> 03:25:23.860
Just wait just a moment. (clearing throat)

4479
03:25:23.860 --> 03:25:24.693
And runs upstairs.

4480
03:25:24.693 --> 03:25:25.526
Madame?

4481
03:25:25.526 --> 03:25:26.930
Madame?

4482
03:25:26.930 --> 03:25:29.930
And you can hear some giggling upstairs.

4483
03:25:32.210 --> 03:25:34.100
She goes and leaves into another room,

4484
03:25:34.100 --> 03:25:35.980
and here's--
Over to the fireplace.

4485
03:25:35.980 --> 03:25:36.813
Mm-hmm.

4486
03:25:36.813 --> 03:25:38.430
It's warm, the hearth is burning.

4487
03:25:40.790 --> 03:25:45.240
Yeah, I mean, it looks pretty awful here.

4488
03:25:46.390 --> 03:25:47.460
Right?

4489
03:25:47.460 --> 03:25:48.293
No?

4490
03:25:49.293 --> 03:25:51.250
Your family has done all right for themselves.

4491
03:25:53.100 --> 03:25:53.933
How you are,

4492
03:25:53.933 --> 03:25:55.870
how are you doing?
How you are?

4493
03:25:55.870 --> 03:25:58.606
How are you are doing?
(laughter)

4494
03:25:58.606 --> 03:26:00.365
How you are--
How are y'all doing?

4495
03:26:00.365 --> 03:26:01.540
(laughter)

4496
03:26:01.540 --> 03:26:02.373
Huh?

4497
03:26:03.260 --> 03:26:06.160
Beauregard!
(gasping)

4498
03:26:06.160 --> 03:26:08.220
And you all look and turn and partway

4499
03:26:08.220 --> 03:26:11.276
down the stair landing, you see a woman,

4500
03:26:11.276 --> 03:26:14.710
you know, similar, darker olive skin,

4501
03:26:16.130 --> 03:26:19.740
hair put up into this very, very tight bun

4502
03:26:19.740 --> 03:26:23.230
with a bit of ponytail that dangles behind,

4503
03:26:23.230 --> 03:26:26.030
a really, really nice, a really nice dress for just being

4504
03:26:26.030 --> 03:26:28.980
casually at the house, but comfortable,

4505
03:26:29.940 --> 03:26:32.700
of a deep green color.

4506
03:26:34.370 --> 03:26:39.370
You can see, she is leaning in a very startled way,

4507
03:26:39.800 --> 03:26:41.620
just looking directly down at Beau.

4508
03:26:43.020 --> 03:26:43.853
Hey, Mom.

4509
03:26:45.950 --> 03:26:50.020
I'm sorry, I didn't know you were coming.

4510
03:26:52.000 --> 03:26:54.500
Yeah, it's kind of a trend that I have going on.

4511
03:26:56.980 --> 03:26:57.813
Well, uh.

4512
03:27:01.090 --> 03:27:03.150
And she heads down the stairs

4513
03:27:03.150 --> 03:27:04.788
at a brisk pace, and approaches,

4514
03:27:04.788 --> 03:27:08.770
and steps up to you, and then, halts,

4515
03:27:08.770 --> 03:27:11.310
unsure how to greet you.

4516
03:27:16.680 --> 03:27:20.740
Gives a somewhat warm, somewhat stilted hug,

4517
03:27:20.740 --> 03:27:22.340
and then pulls back a bit.

4518
03:27:23.520 --> 03:27:25.450
I'm sorry to barge in.

4519
03:27:25.450 --> 03:27:30.450
I know you were wanting to keep me distant

4520
03:27:31.210 --> 03:27:35.380
from the family, but I need to talk to Dad.

4521
03:27:35.380 --> 03:27:38.530
It's important, and then, we'll be gone,

4522
03:27:38.530 --> 03:27:40.310
and you don't have to--
No, no, you--

4523
03:27:40.310 --> 03:27:41.310
Fuck with me anymore.
You could stay

4524
03:27:41.310 --> 03:27:42.210
as long as you like.

4525
03:27:42.210 --> 03:27:44.460
I, who are your friends here?

4526
03:27:44.460 --> 03:27:47.380
And you hear a voice from upstairs go like,

4527
03:27:47.380 --> 03:27:49.330
Mommy?
(laughter)

4528
03:27:49.330 --> 03:27:51.110
And you see, from around the corner,

4529
03:27:51.110 --> 03:27:53.620
the servants trying to catch up to him,

4530
03:27:53.620 --> 03:27:57.250
but you see a young boy, who, in many ways,

4531
03:27:57.250 --> 03:28:00.470
looks like a young, boyish Beauregard,

4532
03:28:00.470 --> 03:28:03.730
longer hair that's in this wild curl,

4533
03:28:03.730 --> 03:28:05.630
looks like he just got out of a shower or something

4534
03:28:05.630 --> 03:28:08.320
and had his head briskly dried.

4535
03:28:08.320 --> 03:28:11.830
He's wearing these baggy pajamas

4536
03:28:11.830 --> 03:28:13.500
that drag just past the fingers,

4537
03:28:13.500 --> 03:28:16.120
and he begins running down the stairs.

4538
03:28:16.120 --> 03:28:17.270
Oh, at two?

4539
03:28:17.270 --> 03:28:19.320
Oof.
(laughter)

4540
03:28:19.320 --> 03:28:22.520
Talented kid.
Two and a half--

4541
03:28:22.520 --> 03:28:24.500
Waiting for that.
Two and a half.

4542
03:28:24.500 --> 03:28:26.544
It's not, when I say tumbling down the stairs.

4543
03:28:26.544 --> 03:28:28.660
(laughter)
That sounds right,

4544
03:28:29.594 --> 03:28:30.730
that sounds right.
Yeah.

4545
03:28:30.730 --> 03:28:32.744
And restore.
(laughter)

4546
03:28:32.744 --> 03:28:35.570
There you go.
(laughter)

4547
03:28:35.570 --> 03:28:37.040
They bounce back.
Yeah.

4548
03:28:37.040 --> 03:28:40.280
No, it's the servant trying to catch up with him,

4549
03:28:41.320 --> 03:28:45.230
and they both come down to join

4550
03:28:45.230 --> 03:28:49.680
as Clara still isn't breaking eye contact

4551
03:28:49.680 --> 03:28:51.940
and she just reaches out and takes your hand,

4552
03:28:51.940 --> 03:28:55.250
and says, it's good to see you.

4553
03:28:58.400 --> 03:28:59.233
Yeah.

4554
03:29:06.410 --> 03:29:08.641
Would you like to stay for dinner?

4555
03:29:08.641 --> 03:29:11.580
(Jester humming)
That's most gracious

4556
03:29:11.580 --> 03:29:14.040
of you, we are the Mighty Nein.

4557
03:29:14.975 --> 03:29:18.370
Mm-hmm.
We are esteemed friends

4558
03:29:18.370 --> 03:29:22.350
of your daughter.
Well, many friends

4559
03:29:22.350 --> 03:29:24.410
of Beauregard are friends of ours, so.

4560
03:29:26.650 --> 03:29:28.400
Hi.
Hi.

4561
03:29:28.400 --> 03:29:33.400
How you are?
I'm Clara Lionett,

4562
03:29:36.620 --> 03:29:39.430
Beauregard's mother, but I assume you know that by now.

4563
03:29:45.920 --> 03:29:48.220
I'll ensure some places are set.

4564
03:29:49.350 --> 03:29:51.770
Hey, Mom, remember that year we had

4565
03:29:53.140 --> 03:29:55.320
that mud slide that ended up happening,

4566
03:29:55.320 --> 03:29:56.670
and took out half of our stock,

4567
03:29:56.670 --> 03:29:59.490
and we only had a few bottles left from that year?

4568
03:29:59.490 --> 03:30:00.323
Yes?

4569
03:30:00.323 --> 03:30:01.910
Can we go grab one of those?

4570
03:30:01.910 --> 03:30:02.743
Of course.

4571
03:30:02.743 --> 03:30:04.140
I've been talking about Alina a lot,

4572
03:30:04.140 --> 03:30:07.800
you know, I'd love to--
Yes, yes, yes, of course.

4573
03:30:07.800 --> 03:30:09.290
Janine, could you get one of those bottles?

4574
03:30:09.290 --> 03:30:12.930
And she goes, right away, and then, darts out.

4575
03:30:14.680 --> 03:30:19.110
Anyway, oh, oh, my goodness, oh my goodness,

4576
03:30:19.110 --> 03:30:22.980
I didn't even, Beauregard, and she turns,

4577
03:30:22.980 --> 03:30:24.810
and you know, clutching the side,

4578
03:30:24.810 --> 03:30:29.470
holding onto the edge, with a big smile, bright eyes,

4579
03:30:29.470 --> 03:30:32.032
the little boy looks up at all of you.

4580
03:30:32.032 --> 03:30:33.471
Whoa.

4581
03:30:33.471 --> 03:30:37.280
(hopeful whimsical music)

4582
03:30:37.280 --> 03:30:38.570
Thoreau, Jr., I'd like you to meet

4583
03:30:38.570 --> 03:30:40.190
your older sister, Beauregard.

4584
03:30:41.600 --> 03:30:44.050
Beauregard, this is Thoreau, Jr.

4585
03:30:49.810 --> 03:30:50.643
That is sister?

4586
03:30:51.857 --> 03:30:53.990
Yes, it's your sister.

4587
03:30:57.223 --> 03:30:58.673
And he walks up to you.

4588
03:31:00.410 --> 03:31:01.570
I crouch down.

4589
03:31:06.659 --> 03:31:08.659
And he puts his arms around you.

4590
03:31:18.400 --> 03:31:21.720
He has that smell to him,

4591
03:31:25.780 --> 03:31:27.680
like all the fucking kids in Kamordah.

4592
03:31:30.110 --> 03:31:31.870
He pulls back a little bit,

4593
03:31:31.870 --> 03:31:34.460
and he's still holding onto you a little bit.

4594
03:31:34.460 --> 03:31:36.160
And he's just looking at you,

4595
03:31:36.160 --> 03:31:41.160
and he's just taking you in, as Clara goes,

4596
03:31:46.450 --> 03:31:51.450
we were hoping you'd come by sometime, to meet him.

4597
03:31:52.760 --> 03:31:57.000
Did you know, it's the timeline

4598
03:31:57.000 --> 03:31:58.700
that was always interesting to me.

4599
03:32:00.210 --> 03:32:02.110
Did you know you were pregnant with him

4600
03:32:03.830 --> 03:32:04.930
when you sent me away?

4601
03:32:12.859 --> 03:32:14.850
The meadow is lovely.

4602
03:32:14.850 --> 03:32:18.050
Jester, would you help me over here for a moment,

4603
03:32:18.050 --> 03:32:20.830
Nott, perhaps, everyone, if we could just.

4604
03:32:23.060 --> 03:32:24.300
I lean down to TJ.

4605
03:32:30.510 --> 03:32:31.343
Hey, little man.

4606
03:32:32.560 --> 03:32:33.393
Hey.

4607
03:32:34.910 --> 03:32:36.360
What's your favorite color?

4608
03:32:41.687 --> 03:32:43.230
(laughter)

4609
03:32:43.230 --> 03:32:46.530
And he points at his mother's dress.

4610
03:32:46.530 --> 03:32:47.363
Green?

4611
03:32:52.290 --> 03:32:56.230
Well, here, you might, you might like this, then.

4612
03:32:58.138 --> 03:33:01.130
I give him the jade necklace, put it around him.

4613
03:33:04.200 --> 03:33:06.677
Yeah.
Yep, yep.

4614
03:33:06.677 --> 03:33:08.170
(laughter)

4615
03:33:08.170 --> 03:33:11.090
It's been in some dank places, little man,

4616
03:33:11.090 --> 03:33:14.792
so it'll help you really build up your immune system.

4617
03:33:14.792 --> 03:33:17.355
(laughter)

4618
03:33:17.355 --> 03:33:19.500
And he's just looking at you, going,

4619
03:33:19.500 --> 03:33:21.430
and slobber coming off of it.

4620
03:33:21.430 --> 03:33:22.730
Antibodies.
Ah, what?

4621
03:33:25.085 --> 03:33:27.910
It tastes like indigo.
(Beau laughing)

4622
03:33:32.072 --> 03:33:33.655
Look, Beauregard,

4623
03:33:41.520 --> 03:33:43.220
things are challenging all around.

4624
03:33:44.670 --> 03:33:48.820
I didn't, your father didn't mean things

4625
03:33:53.782 --> 03:33:56.477
to become so tense when you went away.

4626
03:34:03.359 --> 03:34:05.610
Well, it was a hell of a goodbye, you know?

4627
03:34:11.010 --> 03:34:13.840
I'm not entirely sure why anyone would think

4628
03:34:13.840 --> 03:34:15.234
that that was a good fucking idea

4629
03:34:15.234 --> 03:34:17.040
to handle a situation

4630
03:34:20.810 --> 03:34:22.460
with a daughter that was clearly,

4631
03:34:27.230 --> 03:34:29.030
just wanting your fucking attention.

4632
03:34:36.940 --> 03:34:37.773
I'm sorry?

4633
03:34:40.560 --> 03:34:41.960
I know it doesn't mean much,

4634
03:34:46.100 --> 03:34:48.000
your father was under a lot of stress,

4635
03:34:54.495 --> 03:34:56.010
and things should've been handled differently,

4636
03:34:56.010 --> 03:34:58.530
you're right, you're absolutely right.

4637
03:35:00.850 --> 03:35:01.683
Fuck, Mom.

4638
03:35:05.420 --> 03:35:08.230
So you're just as passive as you were back in the day.

4639
03:35:11.345 --> 03:35:12.820
Did you get that bottle of wine?

4640
03:35:15.790 --> 03:35:19.460
Janine's new here, the footsteps are coming

4641
03:35:19.460 --> 03:35:21.060
from under the cellar.

4642
03:35:21.060 --> 03:35:21.893
Janine!

4643
03:35:24.955 --> 03:35:26.255
Here's the--
My hero.

4644
03:35:27.930 --> 03:35:28.813
Passes the bottle--
Janine, Janine,

4645
03:35:28.813 --> 03:35:30.210
Janine, Janine.

4646
03:35:30.210 --> 03:35:31.707
Thank you, thank you.

4647
03:35:36.580 --> 03:35:37.920
I'll take care of it.
Yeah.

4648
03:35:37.920 --> 03:35:40.389
It's like a, it's one of our most expensive bottles

4649
03:35:40.389 --> 03:35:41.860
of wine, so enjoy.

4650
03:35:44.560 --> 03:35:46.080
We should've sold some, you know, Mom?

4651
03:35:46.080 --> 03:35:47.688
Oh, someone's home.

4652
03:35:47.688 --> 03:35:48.890
The front door opens, and you can hear the rain

4653
03:35:48.890 --> 03:35:51.900
from outside, and you see a figure step in

4654
03:35:51.900 --> 03:35:55.230
with a heavy overcoat, hat on,

4655
03:35:55.230 --> 03:35:59.250
step inside, kick off a bit, close the door,

4656
03:35:59.250 --> 03:36:00.790
take the hat and the coat off,

4657
03:36:01.930 --> 03:36:03.430
hang it on the side, and turn,

4658
03:36:05.660 --> 03:36:10.130
and then, as your father looks you directly in the face,

4659
03:36:11.710 --> 03:36:15.880
and immediately just looks like he's seen a ghost.

4660
03:36:24.250 --> 03:36:25.083
Beauregard.

4661
03:36:31.870 --> 03:36:36.870
Hi.
(Matt chuckling)

4662
03:36:37.308 --> 03:36:39.910
I'm home.
I can see that.

4663
03:36:39.910 --> 03:36:44.910
I was not expecting to see you today.

4664
03:36:44.950 --> 03:36:46.610
Or ever.
Welcome, welcome.

4665
03:36:49.160 --> 03:36:50.760
Friends of yours, I assume?

4666
03:36:52.030 --> 03:36:55.300
Ah, yeah, Mom, Dad, this is the Mighty Nein.

4667
03:36:55.300 --> 03:36:57.100
He looks towards all of you,

4668
03:36:57.100 --> 03:36:59.310
and then looks to Nott, he goes.

4669
03:36:59.310 --> 03:37:00.450
Hi.

4670
03:37:00.450 --> 03:37:02.670
How you are?
Hello.

4671
03:37:02.670 --> 03:37:07.450
Looks to Clara--
Dad, don't do that, Dad.

4672
03:37:07.450 --> 03:37:08.500
Don't.
Looks back,

4673
03:37:08.500 --> 03:37:11.510
and picks up TJ, and puts him in her arms, and.

4674
03:37:12.470 --> 03:37:14.640
Oh, it's fine, it's fine.

4675
03:37:14.640 --> 03:37:16.790
You're fucking embarrassing.
Cute kid.

4676
03:37:18.350 --> 03:37:22.580
He looks very tasty.
(laughter)

4677
03:37:22.580 --> 03:37:24.310
By this point, TJ is looking right at Nott,

4678
03:37:24.310 --> 03:37:26.740
after seeing, he's like, whoa.

4679
03:37:26.740 --> 03:37:28.690
Cool, right?
And Clara's like, uh,

4680
03:37:30.886 --> 03:37:33.236
I'm going to go put TJ to, I'm going to put him down.

4681
03:37:34.951 --> 03:37:36.350
And then, takes off a little bit,

4682
03:37:36.350 --> 03:37:38.600
and Thoreau steps in a bit.

4683
03:37:39.830 --> 03:37:42.060
Well, it's pleasure to have you all.

4684
03:37:42.060 --> 03:37:45.180
I am glad you've all been,

4685
03:37:50.769 --> 03:37:52.360
been traveling, I assume.

4686
03:37:53.750 --> 03:37:55.300
Just going to go and start rifling around

4687
03:37:55.300 --> 03:37:56.650
for some cups or something.

4688
03:38:00.070 --> 03:38:03.360
I have been receiving updates about your work

4689
03:38:03.360 --> 03:38:04.410
with the Cobalt Soul.

4690
03:38:07.310 --> 03:38:09.810
Apparently, been doing some, quite some fine work.

4691
03:38:11.189 --> 03:38:14.280
I guess I should say Expositor Beauregard?

4692
03:38:16.350 --> 03:38:17.183
That's incredible.

4693
03:38:17.183 --> 03:38:19.030
I mean.
Still sending you

4694
03:38:19.030 --> 03:38:21.560
those tuition updates, huh?

4695
03:38:22.850 --> 03:38:24.760
Well, it's important for us to, you know,

4696
03:38:27.340 --> 03:38:30.220
make sure we know how our Beauregard's doing.

4697
03:38:31.510 --> 03:38:34.030
Unparalleled, she is.

4698
03:38:35.280 --> 03:38:36.113
Mm-hmm.

4699
03:38:37.790 --> 03:38:38.623
As she would be.

4700
03:38:40.020 --> 03:38:41.650
Insight check.
Ooh.

4701
03:38:41.650 --> 03:38:43.822
I want to know if he seems like he's genuinely proud of her

4702
03:38:43.822 --> 03:38:46.460
or if--
Go for it,

4703
03:38:46.460 --> 03:38:47.360
the insight check.

4704
03:38:49.030 --> 03:38:49.930
Come on, Jessie.

4705
03:38:51.162 --> 03:38:53.210
Roll hot.
Ooh.

4706
03:38:53.210 --> 03:38:56.950
Yeah.
What is that, 23?

4707
03:38:56.950 --> 03:39:00.380
23.
Wow.

4708
03:39:00.380 --> 03:39:03.340
Whispers, whispers.

4709
03:39:03.340 --> 03:39:05.820
Whispers.
This is intense

4710
03:39:05.820 --> 03:39:08.860
family drama that you'll only get,

4711
03:39:08.860 --> 03:39:11.380
you only get thanks to Hero Forge.

4712
03:39:11.380 --> 03:39:13.470
(laughter)

4713
03:39:13.470 --> 03:39:15.600
Hero Forge, makers or minis and also,

4714
03:39:15.600 --> 03:39:18.240
supporters of intense family dramas.

4715
03:39:20.240 --> 03:39:23.910
Travis is, both of his finger are in his nose right now.

4716
03:39:23.910 --> 03:39:26.690
Is that allergies--
What do you mean, allergies?

4717
03:39:26.690 --> 03:39:27.620
It's winter.

4718
03:39:27.620 --> 03:39:30.030
There's no allergies.
In our own way.

4719
03:39:35.040 --> 03:39:36.543
As the cocaine wears off.

4720
03:39:38.131 --> 03:39:38.964
You need more.

4721
03:39:38.964 --> 03:39:40.603
Now they know our secret.
That's right.

4722
03:39:40.603 --> 03:39:41.460
(laughter)
It's Adderall.

4723
03:39:42.941 --> 03:39:45.710
Eh, good hit, man.
(Matt sighing)

4724
03:39:47.116 --> 03:39:49.600
Now back in.
Found a couple cups.

4725
03:39:49.600 --> 03:39:50.433
Oh, thank you.

4726
03:39:53.299 --> 03:39:54.820
For this, I will try a sip.

4727
03:39:54.820 --> 03:39:56.732
Ooh, here you go.
Oh.

4728
03:39:56.732 --> 03:39:59.370
Well, I,

4729
03:40:01.490 --> 03:40:04.070
a toast to Expositor Beauregard Lionett.

4730
03:40:06.060 --> 03:40:06.893
Cheers.

4731
03:40:18.318 --> 03:40:20.578
I know you well enough, Beauregard, to assume

4732
03:40:20.578 --> 03:40:25.578
you haven't come for the sake of pleasantries.

4733
03:40:32.590 --> 03:40:35.260
I just go up and stand next to Beau,

4734
03:40:35.260 --> 03:40:37.120
and put my hand on her back,

4735
03:40:37.120 --> 03:40:39.220
and I'm going to whisper in her ear.

4736
03:40:40.505 --> 03:40:41.655
Do you want us to stay?

4737
03:40:43.468 --> 03:40:48.468
Please.

4738
03:40:51.050 --> 03:40:52.992
Yep, you know me, Dad.

4739
03:40:52.992 --> 03:40:55.190
I wouldn't be here if I didn't want something.

4740
03:40:59.096 --> 03:41:02.030
(Jester murmuring intensely)

4741
03:41:02.030 --> 03:41:04.080
Listen, that story that you love to tell,

4742
03:41:05.750 --> 03:41:07.050
at every family gathering,

4743
03:41:08.460 --> 03:41:11.540
and for bedtime, and any chance you had,

4744
03:41:12.920 --> 03:41:17.920
that old hag that you talked about, we need to find her.

4745
03:41:20.931 --> 03:41:22.760
(Matt chuckling)

4746
03:41:22.760 --> 03:41:24.880
Is that story even real, or is that just meant

4747
03:41:24.880 --> 03:41:25.713
to terrify me?

4748
03:41:33.259 --> 03:41:35.150
And he finishes his drink and sets it down.

4749
03:41:40.920 --> 03:41:42.520
Of course it's real, Beauregard.

4750
03:41:46.800 --> 03:41:47.650
Look, I know you,

4751
03:41:50.090 --> 03:41:51.740
I know we've had our differences.

4752
03:41:56.050 --> 03:42:01.050
And I've not, I've not been the pinnacle of a father,

4753
03:42:02.670 --> 03:42:04.630
in the same way that you've not been

4754
03:42:04.630 --> 03:42:05.880
a pinnacle of a daughter.

4755
03:42:08.620 --> 03:42:11.100
I accept my responsibilities in the things that I've,

4756
03:42:12.830 --> 03:42:14.130
maybe been a bit harsh on.

4757
03:42:17.196 --> 03:42:18.530
But look what you've become.

4758
03:42:25.640 --> 03:42:30.640
It feels like a weird justification of your behaviors,

4759
03:42:30.985 --> 03:42:35.200
but I'd like to hope that what I became

4760
03:42:35.200 --> 03:42:36.890
had nothing to fucking do with you,

4761
03:42:36.890 --> 03:42:38.540
but maybe I'd be lying to myself.

4762
03:42:45.680 --> 03:42:47.070
Yeah, I was difficult.

4763
03:42:49.034 --> 03:42:51.160
I have my own mess in everything that happened.

4764
03:42:52.133 --> 03:42:54.633
(tense music)

4765
03:42:56.070 --> 03:43:00.420
But I thought a dad was supposed to stay by their kid

4766
03:43:00.420 --> 03:43:02.740
when they're having a fucking hard time.

4767
03:43:08.644 --> 03:43:10.330
His eyes get--
Mom already fucking

4768
03:43:10.330 --> 03:43:12.940
mentioned that life gets difficult and it's hard.

4769
03:43:20.030 --> 03:43:20.863
So you're right.

4770
03:43:20.863 --> 03:43:22.850
Maybe it's easy to justify the easy way out,

4771
03:43:23.970 --> 03:43:25.370
just get rid of the problem.

4772
03:43:27.010 --> 03:43:28.660
That's not what this was about.

4773
03:43:31.570 --> 03:43:33.470
You were on the self-destructive path.

4774
03:43:35.020 --> 03:43:36.290
We didn't know what to do.

4775
03:43:36.290 --> 03:43:37.190
I've never been a,

4776
03:43:41.230 --> 03:43:45.150
no one teaches you how to be a good father.

4777
03:43:53.834 --> 03:43:55.420
I regret choices I've made,

4778
03:43:55.420 --> 03:43:59.820
and you don't think I don't hold myself responsible for,

4779
03:44:07.270 --> 03:44:10.600
I thought I was doing what was best for you, truly.

4780
03:44:13.680 --> 03:44:14.513
You did?

4781
03:44:16.645 --> 03:44:18.860
It was probably the best thing you could've done for me.

4782
03:44:18.860 --> 03:44:19.693
So thank you.

4783
03:44:33.180 --> 03:44:35.280
Tell me the story again, and then I'll go.

4784
03:44:48.520 --> 03:44:49.353
It's true.

4785
03:44:52.674 --> 03:44:54.774
I haven't lied to you or made anything up.

4786
03:44:56.030 --> 03:44:57.530
Why are you asking about this?

4787
03:45:06.060 --> 03:45:07.930
She has information we need.

4788
03:45:12.180 --> 03:45:14.330
You're trying to actually go to her.

4789
03:45:17.800 --> 03:45:18.633
We need her.

4790
03:45:20.870 --> 03:45:21.703
What for?

4791
03:45:33.600 --> 03:45:34.650
Why are you afraid?

4792
03:45:35.825 --> 03:45:37.575
I'm not afraid, I'm just curious.

4793
03:45:43.930 --> 03:45:46.750
We think she has something to do with why.

4794
03:45:50.710 --> 03:45:53.410
We needed to break a curse.

4795
03:45:53.410 --> 03:45:57.427
That's all.
(laughter)

4796
03:45:57.427 --> 03:45:58.970
Damn it.
That voice.

4797
03:45:58.970 --> 03:46:02.370
Judy Garland just showed up. (laughs)

4798
03:46:06.620 --> 03:46:10.160
Your daughter's trying to do what she always does,

4799
03:46:10.160 --> 03:46:10.993
help a friend.

4800
03:46:18.640 --> 03:46:23.180
Well, I mean, I've just heard the stories

4801
03:46:26.090 --> 03:46:30.230
growing up about the witch in the mountains.

4802
03:46:30.230 --> 03:46:31.230
What was her name?

4803
03:46:32.580 --> 03:46:33.413
I don't remember.

4804
03:46:33.413 --> 03:46:34.920
She was just a witch in the mountains.

4805
03:46:41.710 --> 03:46:43.260
Beau, you know how I grew up.

4806
03:46:43.260 --> 03:46:44.093
We had nothing.

4807
03:46:45.038 --> 03:46:47.438
I was in the street, I had nothing else to lose.

4808
03:46:50.668 --> 03:46:54.260
I mean, if I was lucky, this would work.

4809
03:46:54.260 --> 03:46:55.720
If I was not quite as lucky,

4810
03:46:55.720 --> 03:46:57.940
she would've just chopped me up and eaten me.

4811
03:46:57.940 --> 03:47:00.090
I didn't have anything else waiting for me.

4812
03:47:09.883 --> 03:47:13.050
So I went and just wandered north,

4813
03:47:13.050 --> 03:47:15.070
through the mountains, through the forests,

4814
03:47:15.070 --> 03:47:18.500
and my shoes began to split,

4815
03:47:21.939 --> 03:47:24.850
and I was chased by wolves and worse,

4816
03:47:27.051 --> 03:47:29.290
until eventually, one day, I just stumbled

4817
03:47:29.290 --> 03:47:32.630
upon this little shack.

4818
03:47:38.100 --> 03:47:40.080
And there was the witch.

4819
03:47:40.080 --> 03:47:42.560
Right when I began to think it was all a lie,

4820
03:47:42.560 --> 03:47:45.120
and I had thrown myself to the wolves for nothing,

4821
03:47:47.770 --> 03:47:52.446
there she was, with her crooked smile,

4822
03:47:52.446 --> 03:47:55.480
and hungry eyes, and--

4823
03:47:57.550 --> 03:48:00.880
Did she have long arms?
(tense music)

4824
03:48:04.620 --> 03:48:06.020
Longer than natural, yeah.

4825
03:48:10.777 --> 03:48:13.694
And she asked me how I'd come here,

4826
03:48:15.384 --> 03:48:17.510
I threw myself so withered before her,

4827
03:48:17.510 --> 03:48:19.840
and I said I had nothing to lose.

4828
03:48:21.260 --> 03:48:23.660
And heard that she can help people.

4829
03:48:27.990 --> 03:48:32.200
She said she could.
(tense adventure music)

4830
03:48:32.200 --> 03:48:33.900
She said she was a fortune teller.

4831
03:48:35.970 --> 03:48:38.010
She said fortune was her specialty.

4832
03:48:42.110 --> 03:48:47.103
And so, she threw her runes, and played her cards,

4833
03:48:50.339 --> 03:48:54.817
and said that there was a way to get what I always wanted

4834
03:48:59.310 --> 03:49:02.670
for just a fragment of my fortune,

4835
03:49:06.860 --> 03:49:08.910
and I said, well, I don't have a fortune.

4836
03:49:10.170 --> 03:49:14.340
She said, not that fortune, your fortune.

4837
03:49:22.150 --> 03:49:24.300
And I agreed, because I had nothing to lose.

4838
03:49:28.570 --> 03:49:31.430
I said, this woman I wanted to marry doesn't deserve

4839
03:49:31.430 --> 03:49:36.430
an impoverished man, whatever it takes.

4840
03:49:41.770 --> 03:49:45.203
And so, (sighing) she said, I'll be a great craftsman,

4841
03:49:50.250 --> 03:49:51.550
working in vines, spirits,

4842
03:49:53.570 --> 03:49:55.520
to pick a place in the mountain land,

4843
03:49:55.520 --> 03:50:00.520
and wherever I picked, the ground would grow.

4844
03:50:07.680 --> 03:50:10.380
She said a young beau will take on the great name,

4845
03:50:14.180 --> 03:50:19.180
to continue this success, until everything,

4846
03:50:20.020 --> 03:50:25.020
eventually, will humble me by that which I desired most.

4847
03:50:26.236 --> 03:50:29.986
(mysterious adventure music)

4848
03:50:36.480 --> 03:50:38.615
And then she sent me on my way.

4849
03:50:38.615 --> 03:50:42.115
(intense adventure music)

4850
03:50:49.440 --> 03:50:54.440
We came back, we built on land that would last a bit,

4851
03:50:54.740 --> 03:50:56.340
we could borrow from her family,

4852
03:50:59.470 --> 03:51:04.470
and she was right, and we had another blessing.

4853
03:51:14.797 --> 03:51:18.000
(melancholy music)

4854
03:51:18.000 --> 03:51:21.010
And the fact that it all worked means I don't know

4855
03:51:21.010 --> 03:51:25.830
what else she took, and I don't know what's coming

4856
03:51:25.830 --> 03:51:29.630
to humble me, and I just want to protect my family.

4857
03:51:36.210 --> 03:51:40.420
So if you intend to actually go and see this witch,

4858
03:51:41.860 --> 03:51:42.693
just be careful.

4859
03:51:49.110 --> 03:51:49.943
For me?

4860
03:51:51.560 --> 03:51:52.680
Or for you and yours?

4861
03:51:53.950 --> 03:51:58.550
For us, Beauregard.
(melancholy music)

4862
03:52:11.250 --> 03:52:13.550
Maybe I'm the one that's sent to humble you.

4863
03:52:18.783 --> 03:52:21.366
(Matt sighing)

4864
03:52:25.560 --> 03:52:27.600
Beauregard, don't think for any moment

4865
03:52:27.600 --> 03:52:30.800
your mother and I haven't loved you from the depths

4866
03:52:30.800 --> 03:52:32.530
of our hearts this entire time.

4867
03:52:39.700 --> 03:52:41.700
I'm sorry if we didn't show it properly.

4868
03:52:47.580 --> 03:52:50.497
(melancholy music)

4869
03:52:56.458 --> 03:52:59.708
(Beauregard chuckling)

4870
03:53:03.429 --> 03:53:05.210
I don't know if I feel validated

4871
03:53:05.210 --> 03:53:06.760
or vindicated or what.

4872
03:53:08.699 --> 03:53:09.790
It's confusing.

4873
03:53:12.590 --> 03:53:13.730
My apologies.

4874
03:53:13.730 --> 03:53:15.640
I didn't realize this would be

4875
03:53:19.490 --> 03:53:22.650
the evening I think any of us was coming home to.

4876
03:53:24.290 --> 03:53:26.390
I'm a bit caught off guard and unprepared.

4877
03:53:29.066 --> 03:53:29.899
Yeah.

4878
03:53:32.667 --> 03:53:34.217
Well, some things never change.

4879
03:53:36.160 --> 03:53:39.240
Do they, Dad?
Beau?

4880
03:53:43.250 --> 03:53:44.100
I pull her aside.

4881
03:53:46.780 --> 03:53:49.762
Ooh, I'm like seconds away from losing my shit.

4882
03:53:49.762 --> 03:53:51.012
I know, I know you are.

4883
03:53:55.710 --> 03:53:57.510
I just want you to know--
(beverage bubbling)

4884
03:53:57.510 --> 03:54:01.950
you know, he looks like he's telling the truth, Beau.

4885
03:54:05.340 --> 03:54:07.120
Obviously, he was terrible to you.

4886
03:54:07.120 --> 03:54:08.920
Obviously, they did terrible things,

4887
03:54:08.920 --> 03:54:11.120
and they sent you away, and that's horrible.

4888
03:54:13.250 --> 03:54:16.660
But I do believe they love you, I do,

4889
03:54:23.032 --> 03:54:24.680
and I don't expect you to forgive them

4890
03:54:24.680 --> 03:54:25.930
right away, by any means.

4891
03:54:33.730 --> 03:54:35.850
But I would just encourage to maybe,

4892
03:54:37.950 --> 03:54:42.520
maybe listen to them the way you listened to us,

4893
03:54:44.160 --> 03:54:45.190
with open ears.

4894
03:54:50.230 --> 03:54:51.440
How did you do it?
Do what?

4895
03:54:53.570 --> 03:54:55.719
Forgive your dad so quickly.

4896
03:54:55.719 --> 03:55:00.270
(tense music)
Well,

4897
03:55:04.573 --> 03:55:07.007
I mean, he seemed pretty earnest,

4898
03:55:12.826 --> 03:55:15.400
and there's not a lot to be gained

4899
03:55:15.400 --> 03:55:17.040
from holding grudges.

4900
03:55:18.590 --> 03:55:21.370
You know, it feels like poison inside of you.

4901
03:55:23.200 --> 03:55:26.483
How much better would it feel if you could just be clean?

4902
03:55:32.680 --> 03:55:34.614
I'm so good at holding grudges.

4903
03:55:34.614 --> 03:55:36.364
I know, you're really good at it.

4904
03:55:44.668 --> 03:55:48.001
You make an interesting point, though.

4905
03:55:55.410 --> 03:55:58.780
I walk back over.
This is an excellent wine.

4906
03:56:00.420 --> 03:56:01.340
Well, looking at the bottle,

4907
03:56:01.340 --> 03:56:05.700
it's an extremely rare one, that I would've preferred

4908
03:56:05.700 --> 03:56:06.580
to have kept in the cellar,

4909
03:56:06.580 --> 03:56:09.740
but it's a special occasion, so enjoy it.

4910
03:56:09.740 --> 03:56:12.082
The most special occasion, a reunion.

4911
03:56:12.082 --> 03:56:13.532
(clearing throat) Beauregard.

4912
03:56:24.494 --> 03:56:26.994
I'm going to go find this woman

4913
03:56:28.710 --> 03:56:31.810
that you based so much of our entire lives around,

4914
03:56:43.420 --> 03:56:45.270
and hope that I can better understand

4915
03:56:49.020 --> 03:56:50.840
why and where you're coming from,

4916
03:56:58.707 --> 03:57:00.943
because while you and Mom didn't do a lot

4917
03:57:03.210 --> 03:57:05.440
of the footwork into understanding me,

4918
03:57:09.510 --> 03:57:14.510
it doesn't mean that I can't do my research

4919
03:57:16.240 --> 03:57:18.190
to better understand where I came from.

4920
03:57:24.352 --> 03:57:26.217
I've done a lot to reflect on

4921
03:57:32.670 --> 03:57:34.250
what choices I've made to put me

4922
03:57:34.250 --> 03:57:35.650
in the position that I'm in.

4923
03:57:40.730 --> 03:57:42.730
And I guess I'm just mildly disappointed

4924
03:57:45.200 --> 03:57:47.800
to see that the same amount of work hasn't been done

4925
03:57:49.220 --> 03:57:53.050
or at least even remotely attempted.

4926
03:57:56.770 --> 03:57:59.650
That's not entirely true, Beauregard.

4927
03:58:05.870 --> 03:58:07.220
Not entirely wrong, either.

4928
03:58:17.524 --> 03:58:20.774
I gave Thoreau Jr. the jade necklace.

4929
03:58:22.720 --> 03:58:24.706
Make sure he doesn't choke on it.

4930
03:58:24.706 --> 03:58:28.039
(tense adventure music)

4931
03:58:29.850 --> 03:58:34.850
Well, then don't, don't leave and go to this woman

4932
03:58:34.900 --> 03:58:36.750
without any sort of protection.

4933
03:58:36.750 --> 03:58:39.530
Hold on just a second, and he nervously

4934
03:58:39.530 --> 03:58:43.570
runs past you, and heads off into one of the side chambers.

4935
03:58:45.640 --> 03:58:47.890
You're doing great, you're doing amazing.

4936
03:58:47.890 --> 03:58:49.590
You've done a really good job, Beau.

4937
03:58:49.590 --> 03:58:51.070
Yeah.
We all are here with you.

4938
03:58:51.070 --> 03:58:53.340
Question, protection?

4939
03:58:53.340 --> 03:58:54.520
He thinks that protects you?

4940
03:58:54.520 --> 03:58:56.750
I told you he was incredibly superstitious.

4941
03:58:56.750 --> 03:58:57.738
We never checked it out, though.

4942
03:58:57.738 --> 03:58:59.561
It might've been protective,

4943
03:58:59.561 --> 03:59:01.463
or really valuable, I don't know.

4944
03:59:01.463 --> 03:59:03.978
Cast Good and Evil.

4945
03:59:03.978 --> 03:59:06.961
Okay, Detect Good and Evil.

4946
03:59:06.961 --> 03:59:11.236
Fireball.
(laughter)

4947
03:59:11.236 --> 03:59:16.236
With white shells.
(laughter)

4948
03:59:16.440 --> 03:59:18.010
I'm curious if this is a guy

4949
03:59:18.010 --> 03:59:20.560
who's had things blast cursed.

4950
03:59:20.560 --> 03:59:22.800
Sure.
How superstitious is he

4951
03:59:22.800 --> 03:59:24.320
in this house, how fearful is he?

4952
03:59:24.320 --> 03:59:25.153
Okay.

4953
03:59:26.593 --> 03:59:28.493
Well, Detect Good and Evil, all right.

4954
03:59:29.531 --> 03:59:31.890
I know, I'm going to do a Detect Magic on top of it.

4955
03:59:31.890 --> 03:59:32.980
Okay.

4956
03:59:32.980 --> 03:59:34.790
He rushes back in, and in his hands,

4957
03:59:34.790 --> 03:59:37.970
and you can see a different design,

4958
03:59:37.970 --> 03:59:42.040
but there is another tighter jade necklace,

4959
03:59:42.040 --> 03:59:45.140
different carvings, he rushes over and he goes,

4960
03:59:46.050 --> 03:59:50.590
this is your mother's, but just please, please, for me,

4961
03:59:50.590 --> 03:59:51.940
if you're going to do this.

4962
03:59:54.400 --> 03:59:55.900
Always good to have an upgrade.

4963
03:59:59.850 --> 04:00:02.070
You don't sense anything on the list.

4964
04:00:03.370 --> 04:00:06.170
Detect Magic, just for fun, too, just for the room,

4965
04:00:06.170 --> 04:00:07.430
for everything.
Okay.

4966
04:00:07.430 --> 04:00:09.780
And the lights above, definitely.

4967
04:00:11.460 --> 04:00:12.730
You know, the equipment you're wearing.

4968
04:00:12.730 --> 04:00:14.490
The necklace he's granting is not magical.

4969
04:00:14.490 --> 04:00:16.450
Mm.
It's super special, though.

4970
04:00:18.944 --> 04:00:19.777
Yeah.

4971
04:00:22.320 --> 04:00:23.740
And he just, as he grabs your hands,

4972
04:00:23.740 --> 04:00:27.483
handing it to you, withdraws and recomposes himself.

4973
04:00:27.483 --> 04:00:30.150
(hopeful music)

4974
04:00:38.410 --> 04:00:39.243
I only hope,

4975
04:00:48.160 --> 04:00:50.810
I hope I can make up to you the missteps

4976
04:00:52.900 --> 04:00:54.550
that I can plainly see behind me.

4977
04:00:58.170 --> 04:01:01.900
It's rare that a child's damage at that age

4978
04:01:09.851 --> 04:01:12.768
and behavior doesn't reflect how I,

4979
04:01:22.646 --> 04:01:24.651
hmm, misstepped in my parenting.

4980
04:01:24.651 --> 04:01:27.151
(tense music)

4981
04:01:33.781 --> 04:01:35.531
Thank you for that.

4982
04:01:41.050 --> 04:01:44.923
Your grandfather was no beach, either, and there's,

4983
04:01:52.340 --> 04:01:54.670
there's difficulty in realizing

4984
04:01:58.480 --> 04:02:02.120
how much you intended to be different,

4985
04:02:05.460 --> 04:02:09.130
and then, to realize you've become so similar.

4986
04:02:15.990 --> 04:02:17.790
So I hope with the company you keep,

4987
04:02:19.430 --> 04:02:21.680
maybe you won't repeat the same mistakes I have,

4988
04:02:26.370 --> 04:02:27.990
by treating the people around you.

4989
04:02:33.190 --> 04:02:34.490
I'm trying to do better.

4990
04:02:40.020 --> 04:02:41.960
I'll let you know how it goes.

4991
04:02:41.960 --> 04:02:42.793
Good, good.

4992
04:02:48.840 --> 04:02:49.900
Are we staying, are we going--

4993
04:02:49.900 --> 04:02:51.450
Are you staying for dinner?

4994
04:02:51.450 --> 04:02:52.530
What exactly are we doing?

4995
04:02:52.530 --> 04:02:53.730
We'll leave now, yeah?

4996
04:02:55.050 --> 04:02:56.250
We should go.
Yeah?

4997
04:02:58.570 --> 04:02:59.617
Yeah, yeah.

4998
04:02:59.617 --> 04:03:03.700
Tell Mom thank you.

4999
04:03:05.760 --> 04:03:07.150
Mom!

5000
04:03:07.150 --> 04:03:10.070
You look back and she's actually looking out

5001
04:03:10.070 --> 04:03:13.000
past the doorway, and darts behind,

5002
04:03:13.000 --> 04:03:14.550
and then walks out.

5003
04:03:14.550 --> 04:03:15.383
Yes?

5004
04:03:18.970 --> 04:03:21.350
I'm going, Mom.
Oh.

5005
04:03:22.450 --> 04:03:27.450
Oh, all right, and she reaches behind,

5006
04:03:28.050 --> 04:03:30.900
and pulls TJ behind her.

5007
04:03:30.900 --> 04:03:33.950
You see he like comes up alongside her,

5008
04:03:35.694 --> 04:03:38.730
and she walks up to you, and hands TJ over

5009
04:03:38.730 --> 04:03:41.220
to your father, and takes your hand,

5010
04:03:49.520 --> 04:03:54.520
sorry things, things are strained tonight,

5011
04:03:57.730 --> 04:03:58.980
but it's good to see you.

5012
04:04:03.180 --> 04:04:05.030
I just lean in and I whisper,

5013
04:04:09.180 --> 04:04:11.320
you're allowed to have an opinion, too, Mom.

5014
04:04:19.545 --> 04:04:22.330
I'll let you know how it goes.

5015
04:04:22.330 --> 04:04:23.163
Of course.

5016
04:04:24.900 --> 04:04:26.930
And she squeezes your hand and lets go,

5017
04:04:28.770 --> 04:04:32.160
and then, she looks over,

5018
04:04:32.160 --> 04:04:33.990
and TJ comes up again.

5019
04:04:34.920 --> 04:04:37.020
He looks up at you, and holds the necklace back up again

5020
04:04:37.020 --> 04:04:38.820
and starts sucking on it again, and Clara's like,

5021
04:04:38.820 --> 04:04:43.260
no, no, honey.
(soft laughter)

5022
04:04:52.390 --> 04:04:53.340
No, no, no, no, no.

5023
04:04:57.324 --> 04:04:58.430
And your dad turns to you.

5024
04:05:00.310 --> 04:05:02.820
Be safe.
(tense music)

5025
04:05:04.860 --> 04:05:06.170
I will, I promise.

5026
04:05:09.380 --> 04:05:12.650
Keep her safe.
Always.

5027
04:05:12.650 --> 04:05:14.160
Of course.

5028
04:05:14.160 --> 04:05:16.910
You want to give her an awkward hug or anything?

5029
04:05:16.910 --> 04:05:19.560
You know she's going to face a pretty powerful being.

5030
04:05:20.551 --> 04:05:22.650
I think we're good.
Right.

5031
04:05:23.580 --> 04:05:24.540
Okay, just checking.

5032
04:05:24.540 --> 04:05:26.700
Good luck to you, too.
Any landmarks

5033
04:05:26.700 --> 04:05:27.533
to look out for?

5034
04:05:29.900 --> 04:05:31.740
If you hear noise, run.

5035
04:05:37.667 --> 04:05:39.467
There was a, a sick, bramble tangle,

5036
04:05:44.690 --> 04:05:47.450
partially grayed and petrified like many

5037
04:05:47.450 --> 04:05:49.040
of the woods there.

5038
04:05:49.960 --> 04:05:51.160
That means you're close.

5039
04:05:52.810 --> 04:05:55.820
If the ground begins to tar, it looks like,

5040
04:05:57.360 --> 04:05:58.360
you're almost there.

5041
04:06:00.960 --> 04:06:05.960
And if I recall, it's pretty straight north from here.

5042
04:06:11.917 --> 04:06:12.750
All right.

5043
04:06:12.750 --> 04:06:16.000
Should we take horses there, or should we go on foot?

5044
04:06:17.610 --> 04:06:19.090
You can take horses as far as you want,

5045
04:06:19.090 --> 04:06:20.770
but there'll be a point where you won't be able

5046
04:06:20.770 --> 04:06:22.610
to bring them with you.

5047
04:06:22.610 --> 04:06:24.610
Maybe we should leave the horses here?

5048
04:06:24.610 --> 04:06:27.303
We'll take them a bit.
All right.

5049
04:06:27.303 --> 04:06:31.462
(laughter)

5050
04:06:31.462 --> 04:06:32.862
Oh, you care about horses.

5051
04:06:36.698 --> 04:06:37.820
Well, the Mighty Nein,

5052
04:06:39.230 --> 04:06:40.710
it's been a pleasure having you.

5053
04:06:40.710 --> 04:06:45.503
Welcome to the Lionett Estate, and travel safe.

5054
04:06:46.490 --> 04:06:48.470
We look forward to seeing you here again.

5055
04:06:49.670 --> 04:06:50.503
And you, too.

5056
04:06:51.494 --> 04:06:53.490
I, many years ago, I was granted a wish

5057
04:06:53.490 --> 04:06:56.500
by that same witch, and I turned into this

5058
04:06:56.500 --> 04:06:59.545
as a result, so I hope that doesn't happen to you.

5059
04:06:59.545 --> 04:07:01.470
(laughter)

5060
04:07:01.470 --> 04:07:03.210
Bye.
Bye, Dad.

5061
04:07:05.030 --> 04:07:08.730
I swipe another bottle of wine that they have on display

5062
04:07:08.730 --> 04:07:10.350
on the way out.
And I will steal

5063
04:07:10.350 --> 04:07:14.297
literally anything.
(laughter)

5064
04:07:14.297 --> 04:07:15.820
If I don't see anything on the way out,

5065
04:07:15.820 --> 04:07:18.040
I'll just take the cup I was drinking.

5066
04:07:18.040 --> 04:07:19.670
The cup you still have, definitely.

5067
04:07:19.670 --> 04:07:20.503
It's a nice cup.

5068
04:07:21.592 --> 04:07:24.563
On the way out, there are these small,

5069
04:07:26.500 --> 04:07:28.700
square windows off to each side

5070
04:07:28.700 --> 04:07:31.690
of the entryway, and they have these little,

5071
04:07:31.690 --> 04:07:34.560
decorative tables with nice velvet over them,

5072
04:07:34.560 --> 04:07:36.540
and you can see, there's a couple of art pieces there

5073
04:07:36.540 --> 04:07:38.770
that are relatively easy to grab.

5074
04:07:38.770 --> 04:07:40.960
I'll grab one.
Doing it stealthily or--

5075
04:07:40.960 --> 04:07:43.520
Stealthily.
Roll sleight of hand.

5076
04:07:43.520 --> 04:07:48.520
(groaning) 28.
I am so disappointed.

5077
04:07:49.133 --> 04:07:51.710
You glance down, and it's this beautiful

5078
04:07:51.710 --> 04:07:55.950
jade rabbit sculpture.
Ooh.

5079
04:07:55.950 --> 04:07:57.600
When our friend gets out of the shitter,

5080
04:07:57.600 --> 04:07:59.171
tell him to meet us outside.

5081
04:07:59.171 --> 04:08:02.901
(laughter)

5082
04:08:02.901 --> 04:08:05.066
I'm just going to linger and hang back.

5083
04:08:05.066 --> 04:08:07.408
(laughter)

5084
04:08:07.408 --> 04:08:09.140
I'm one of the last ones to walk out.

5085
04:08:09.140 --> 04:08:09.973
Okay.

5086
04:08:12.780 --> 04:08:15.680
Thoreau approaches to close the door behind.

5087
04:08:18.730 --> 04:08:20.640
You should be very proud of your daughter.

5088
04:08:21.750 --> 04:08:23.300
You are very lucky to have her.

5089
04:08:25.079 --> 04:08:25.912
I agree.

5090
04:08:29.085 --> 04:08:30.810
You should show her that more, then.

5091
04:08:34.350 --> 04:08:38.690
If, for some reason, we end up killing this hag,

5092
04:08:38.690 --> 04:08:40.420
will all of this go away?

5093
04:08:47.280 --> 04:08:50.280
I don't know.
(tense music)

5094
04:08:53.008 --> 04:08:54.420
Well, maybe that would help you remember

5095
04:08:54.420 --> 04:08:55.270
what's important.

5096
04:08:57.300 --> 04:08:58.200
Have a good night.

5097
04:09:01.120 --> 04:09:02.390
As you leave, he just stands there

5098
04:09:02.390 --> 04:09:04.930
with the door open, watching you all walk away,

5099
04:09:04.930 --> 04:09:08.430
those words still echoing through his ears

5100
04:09:08.430 --> 04:09:13.358
before the door slowly (clicking).

5101
04:09:13.358 --> 04:09:14.870
Orphan.

5102
04:09:14.870 --> 04:09:18.090
As you all--
(laughter)

5103
04:09:18.090 --> 04:09:22.460
As you all step back out into the cold night rain.

5104
04:09:22.460 --> 04:09:24.650
Teaches a lot.
The sun now set,

5105
04:09:24.650 --> 04:09:27.100
the sky darkened beneath the storm clouds,

5106
04:09:27.100 --> 04:09:29.530
as another distant flash of lightning

5107
04:09:29.530 --> 04:09:33.810
brings the calming thunder to your ears, Yasha.

5108
04:09:34.900 --> 04:09:37.550
I cry a little bit, and then, just grab everybody,

5109
04:09:37.550 --> 04:09:38.640
and huddle everybody in.

5110
04:09:38.640 --> 04:09:40.160
Hug, hug, hug, hug, hug, hug.

5111
04:09:40.160 --> 04:09:44.340
And you all come in for a cold, rainy hug here in the mud,

5112
04:09:44.340 --> 04:09:48.010
on the outskirts on the Lionett Estate, here in Kamordah,

5113
04:09:49.530 --> 04:09:52.450
a union of support.

5114
04:09:52.450 --> 04:09:53.350
Yeah, it's good.

5115
04:09:55.210 --> 04:09:57.120
And that's where we'll end tonight's episode.

5116
04:09:57.120 --> 04:09:58.740
Ooh.
(Taliesin snapping fingers)

5117
04:09:58.740 --> 04:10:01.570
Man, whoa.
Oh man.

5118
04:10:01.570 --> 04:10:03.900
Oof.
Yeah.

5119
04:10:03.900 --> 04:10:06.950
Totally where you expected it to go, right?

5120
04:10:06.950 --> 04:10:08.030
Totally expected.

5121
04:10:08.030 --> 04:10:09.400
It was a good show.

5122
04:10:10.840 --> 04:10:12.290
I've had all these battle maps

5123
04:10:12.290 --> 04:10:13.810
for all the different direction

5124
04:10:13.810 --> 04:10:15.980
for a lot of this, and I don't care.

5125
04:10:15.980 --> 04:10:18.480
This has all been a great fucking role play, man.

5126
04:10:18.480 --> 04:10:20.040
Travis, Travis, when you were gone,

5127
04:10:20.040 --> 04:10:24.370
was Fjord's stool solid or runnier, or?

5128
04:10:24.370 --> 04:10:25.746
Stony.
Stony?

5129
04:10:25.746 --> 04:10:28.360
(groaning)
(laughter)

5130
04:10:28.360 --> 04:10:30.995
Vegan milkshake stony, like that level.

5131
04:10:30.995 --> 04:10:31.964
Whoa.
Yeah.

5132
04:10:31.964 --> 04:10:34.637
It's a rough time.

5133
04:10:34.637 --> 04:10:37.130
Wow, guys, wow.

5134
04:10:38.152 --> 04:10:39.400
My eyes were puffy.
Yeah.

5135
04:10:39.400 --> 04:10:40.920
I can't imagine why.
(Marisha laughing)

5136
04:10:40.920 --> 04:10:41.870
You're going to be exhausted.

5137
04:10:41.870 --> 04:10:43.400
I'm going to sleep so good.

5138
04:10:43.400 --> 04:10:45.241
Man, it's so weird playing your asshole dad.

5139
04:10:45.241 --> 04:10:46.380
Yeah.
(laughter)

5140
04:10:46.380 --> 04:10:47.390
Yeah, it's kind of creepy.

5141
04:10:47.390 --> 04:10:51.903
It's a very strange disassociation exercise.

5142
04:10:53.057 --> 04:10:54.583
I hope so.
Oh yeah.

5143
04:10:54.583 --> 04:10:57.500
(laughter)

5144
04:11:02.170 --> 04:11:03.140
Man.

5145
04:11:03.140 --> 04:11:04.614
Well, thank you guys for joining us.

5146
04:11:04.614 --> 04:11:06.900
(cheering)
(laughter)

5147
04:11:06.900 --> 04:11:09.010
That's still funny.
Have fun on this show.

5148
04:11:09.010 --> 04:11:10.779
We have fun.
Oh yeah.

5149
04:11:10.779 --> 04:11:12.220
We have--
I am sweating,

5150
04:11:12.220 --> 04:11:14.300
and was just stress eating.
Yeah.

5151
04:11:14.300 --> 04:11:15.970
It was so much stress eating.

5152
04:11:15.970 --> 04:11:18.730
The back of my neck is drenched.

5153
04:11:18.730 --> 04:11:22.580
Ugh, oh man, this is, ugh.

5154
04:11:22.580 --> 04:11:25.200
No, no.
There are NPCs

5155
04:11:25.200 --> 04:11:27.100
that are challenging and such,

5156
04:11:29.708 --> 04:11:33.020
but between your dad and Taryon's dad,

5157
04:11:33.020 --> 04:11:36.840
those are two NPCs that have been the grossest

5158
04:11:36.840 --> 04:11:38.885
to step into for different reasons.

5159
04:11:38.885 --> 04:11:40.520
(Marisha laughing)
Challenges.

5160
04:11:40.520 --> 04:11:41.353
Yeah.

5161
04:11:44.100 --> 04:11:45.560
Well.
Yeah, but the syphilis,

5162
04:11:45.560 --> 04:11:47.110
man, it's the--
That's just funny.

5163
04:11:47.110 --> 04:11:49.920
(laughter)
The syphilis arc.

5164
04:11:49.920 --> 04:11:51.270
You left an impression.

5165
04:11:53.433 --> 04:11:54.310
I'm just looking over here, I'm like--

5166
04:11:54.310 --> 04:11:56.200
It was Benadryl.
I'm looking down here,

5167
04:11:56.200 --> 04:11:58.540
I'm like rolling to see, like yeah, no,

5168
04:11:58.540 --> 04:11:59.380
they're going to run into them again.

5169
04:11:59.380 --> 04:12:00.213
Ooh, that was tough.

5170
04:12:00.213 --> 04:12:01.590
Yeah, a fun recurring theme.

5171
04:12:01.590 --> 04:12:03.320
I felt that there was something in that fire

5172
04:12:03.320 --> 04:12:05.570
that was worth, I'm so glad, that was great.

5173
04:12:05.570 --> 04:12:07.470
The fire?
Mm-hmm.

5174
04:12:07.470 --> 04:12:09.320
The bandit camp.
Oh.

5175
04:12:10.290 --> 04:12:12.330
That's a whole different thing.

5176
04:12:12.330 --> 04:12:13.670
There's a coincidence down there.

5177
04:12:13.670 --> 04:12:15.760
I know, anyway.
Wanna look that up.

5178
04:12:15.760 --> 04:12:17.030
Thank you guys for joining us

5179
04:12:17.030 --> 04:12:20.340
for this extensively emotionally tense episode.

5180
04:12:21.330 --> 04:12:23.830
We'll be back here next Thursday.

5181
04:12:23.830 --> 04:12:26.400
Looks like treading into the Cyrios Mountains.

5182
04:12:26.400 --> 04:12:27.970
Oh God.
Surrounding Mount Mentiri.

5183
04:12:27.970 --> 04:12:30.000
Oh, you guys remember when we first started,

5184
04:12:30.000 --> 04:12:31.350
when we were like, witch hut, witch hut--

5185
04:12:31.350 --> 04:12:34.660
Witch hut, witch hut.
We're going to a witch hut.

5186
04:12:34.660 --> 04:12:36.150
Oh man.
And we surrounding

5187
04:12:36.150 --> 04:12:37.700
that hut, we're like, there's a witch in it.

5188
04:12:37.700 --> 04:12:39.720
Nope, yeah there is.
It was a troll.

5189
04:12:39.720 --> 04:12:41.080
Yeah there is.
Yeah.

5190
04:12:41.080 --> 04:12:42.320
There's an actual witch hunt.

5191
04:12:42.320 --> 04:12:43.840
Oh my God.
And we know,

5192
04:12:43.840 --> 04:12:44.920
we're going to be prepared,

5193
04:12:44.920 --> 04:12:46.730
we're going to have our stuff together.

5194
04:12:46.730 --> 04:12:47.645
Sure we're going to be prepared.

5195
