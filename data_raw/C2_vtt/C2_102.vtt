00:00:00.449 --> 00:00:02.931
MATT: Hello everyone, and welcome
to tonight's episode of Critical Role,

00:00:02.931 --> 00:00:04.340
where a bunch of us nerdy-ass voice actors sit around

00:00:04.340 --> 00:00:05.556
and play Dungeons &amp; Dragons.

00:00:05.556 --> 00:00:09.661
TRAVIS: (hollering) We play Dungeons &amp; Dragons!

00:00:09.661 --> 00:00:11.741
MATT: Vibrato, thank you.

00:00:11.741 --> 00:00:13.478
I always wonder where it's going to go.

00:00:13.478 --> 00:00:14.965
Before we jump into tonight's episode,

00:00:14.965 --> 00:00:17.046
we're going to go ahead and go through some announcements

00:00:17.046 --> 00:00:18.882
if you don't mind.

00:00:18.882 --> 00:00:21.248
The first is our first sponsor for the night

00:00:21.248 --> 00:00:23.861
which is NordVPN.

00:00:23.861 --> 00:00:24.694
LIAM: Nord.

00:00:24.694 --> 00:00:26.527
MATT: Sam, if you don't--

00:00:27.497 --> 00:00:28.580
Sam?

00:00:30.486 --> 00:00:32.036
Sam was supposed--
LIAM: Oh, Matt?

00:00:32.036 --> 00:00:34.809
I'm sorry. If I may,

00:00:34.809 --> 00:00:38.794
Blackwillow69@aol.com and Cryptonic Override

00:00:38.794 --> 00:00:42.472
were tricked by the Serial Killer about four months ago.

00:00:42.472 --> 00:00:46.493
Remember, they tried to defeat the Ultra Codex

00:00:46.493 --> 00:00:49.053
and were banished inside the internet.

00:00:49.053 --> 00:00:50.587
MATT: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:00:50.587 --> 00:00:51.831
Wait, wait, wait, but then how are we supposed

00:00:51.831 --> 00:00:54.347
to, like, do this NordVPN sponsorship, then,

00:00:54.347 --> 00:00:55.629
if we don't have either of them,

00:00:55.629 --> 00:00:59.171
and also, what are Sam and Laura doing now

00:00:59.171 --> 00:01:00.980
if they're not here?

00:01:01.932 --> 00:01:04.928
(electronic music)

00:01:04.928 --> 00:01:07.537
LAURA: Blackwillow69, we've been trapped in the dark web

00:01:07.537 --> 00:01:08.847
for nano-days.

00:01:08.847 --> 00:01:10.503
Where in the cyber code are we now?

00:01:10.503 --> 00:01:13.113
SAM: It's hard to say, Cryptonic Override.

00:01:13.113 --> 00:01:15.716
The Serial Killer is so jacked in,

00:01:15.716 --> 00:01:17.283
he could've uploaded us anywhere.

00:01:17.283 --> 00:01:21.595
The brony web, DARPAnet, heck, we might even be in Bing,

00:01:21.595 --> 00:01:23.699
where no one goes.

00:01:23.699 --> 00:01:25.757
LAURA: Watch out! Incoming meme cluster.

00:01:25.757 --> 00:01:26.590
(dog barking)

00:01:30.894 --> 00:01:33.727
(digital beeping)

00:01:35.463 --> 00:01:38.880
SAM and LAURA: (grunting)

00:01:40.169 --> 00:01:43.607
(keyboard clacking)

00:01:43.607 --> 00:01:45.740
(beep, beep, beep)

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:46.740
(beep)

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:49.067
SAM: Oh no! A virus firewall.

00:01:49.067 --> 00:01:53.658
We've got to hack through it.

00:01:53.658 --> 00:01:54.530
Whoa!
(digital lasers firing)

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:55.572
Laser sword!

00:01:56.572 --> 00:01:58.764
(grunts)

00:01:58.764 --> 00:02:01.347
(horse neighs)

00:02:02.438 --> 00:02:03.279
(glass shatters)
(cat cries)

00:02:03.279 --> 00:02:06.392
LAURA: Wow, now that was some spearfishing, Blackwillow.

00:02:06.392 --> 00:02:08.099
You pwned that trojan horse.

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:12.017
SAM: Me? I've never seen a cube gleamed IRL before.

00:02:12.017 --> 00:02:14.992
Cryptonic Override FTW.

00:02:14.992 --> 00:02:16.414
LAURA: You know what?

00:02:16.414 --> 00:02:18.179
We make a pretty elite team.

00:02:18.179 --> 00:02:20.064
SAM: Live by the code, die by the code.

00:02:20.064 --> 00:02:21.518
Am I right?

00:02:21.518 --> 00:02:25.601
SAM and LAURA: Hackz0rs click together.

00:02:27.264 --> 00:02:29.502
LAURA: We've got to get to safety.
SAM: Yeah, you're right, you're right.

00:02:29.502 --> 00:02:32.496
LAURA: Look, I think somehow we've managed to port

00:02:32.496 --> 00:02:34.668
into Dani Carr's Pinterest account.

00:02:34.668 --> 00:02:37.107
SAM: Whoa, it's adorable.

00:02:37.107 --> 00:02:38.338
LAURA: So cute.

00:02:38.338 --> 00:02:39.675
SAM: We'll be safe here for a while,

00:02:39.675 --> 00:02:42.299
but to get out of the dark net we need someone

00:02:42.299 --> 00:02:45.430
to unjack us from the Ultra Codex.

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:49.115
LAURA: But only a class C12 Hackmaster
could achieve such a move,

00:02:49.115 --> 00:02:51.651
and they would definitely need NordVPN.

00:02:51.651 --> 00:02:53.498
Where can we find someone like that?

00:02:53.498 --> 00:02:55.061
SAM: Huh.

00:02:55.061 --> 00:02:55.894
Hmm.

00:02:58.927 --> 00:03:00.657
LIAM: [inaudible]
(laughter)

00:03:00.657 --> 00:03:02.034
ASHLEY: Boy.

00:03:02.034 --> 00:03:03.511
TALIESIN: Damn it.

00:03:03.511 --> 00:03:06.899
I swore I was through with my hacker past,

00:03:06.899 --> 00:03:11.779
but I guess it's time to boot up and suit up.

00:03:11.779 --> 00:03:13.970
TRAVIS: (gasps)

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:17.301
TALIESIN: Right now, NordVPN has a special offer:

00:03:17.301 --> 00:03:19.506
a three year plan with 70% off,

00:03:19.506 --> 00:03:21.599
plus an additional month free

00:03:21.599 --> 00:03:22.432

00:03:35.129 --> 00:03:40.129
Now, I'm going to use it for one last slice!

00:03:40.137 --> 00:03:41.649
ASHLEY: Whoa!

00:03:41.649 --> 00:03:42.856
(laughter)

00:03:42.856 --> 00:03:43.689
MATT: Okay.

00:03:46.442 --> 00:03:48.633
I guess...

00:03:48.633 --> 00:03:50.590
tune in next episode?

00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:53.762
They're-- They're episodes now, why?

00:03:53.762 --> 00:03:55.102
Why are-- okay.

00:03:55.102 --> 00:03:59.337
Cool, thanks, guys and thank you, NordVPN.

00:03:59.337 --> 00:04:00.170
LIAM: Yay!

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:04.283
(laughter)

00:04:04.283 --> 00:04:09.200
MATT: Okay, our second sponsor tonight, (laughs)

00:04:11.414 --> 00:04:13.763
our friends at D&amp;D Beyond.

00:04:13.763 --> 00:04:16.651
They've been with us since the beginning of the campaign,

00:04:16.651 --> 00:04:20.307
and happy to have you along for the return to this chaos.

00:04:20.307 --> 00:04:21.846
If you guys haven't had a chance check it out yet,

00:04:21.846 --> 00:04:23.147
it's an amazing online digital tool

00:04:23.147 --> 00:04:25.483
for all of your D&amp;D campaign needs both as a player

00:04:25.483 --> 00:04:27.316
and a DM,

00:04:27.316 --> 00:04:30.666
and you can now pre-order the new announced D&amp;D

00:04:30.666 --> 00:04:33.682
story campaign book coming out soon

00:04:33.682 --> 00:04:36.376
of the Icewind Dale, Rime of the Frost Maiden.

00:04:36.376 --> 00:04:37.803
I wanted to make sure I got the name right on that one,

00:04:37.803 --> 00:04:40.261
which Icewind Dale is good shit, anyway

00:04:40.261 --> 00:04:42.823
You can get it now on D&amp;D Beyond for a pre-order

00:04:42.823 --> 00:04:44.833
and immediately unlock six character sheet backgrounds

00:04:44.833 --> 00:04:48.030
and unique digital dice for the setting, which is cool.

00:04:48.030 --> 00:04:49.741
The release includes 50 brand new monsters,

00:04:49.741 --> 00:04:51.213
over 26 terrifying locations,

00:04:51.213 --> 00:04:54.812
and 320 pages of modern horror.

00:04:54.812 --> 00:04:56.493
So check it out now at D&amp;D Beyond.

00:04:56.493 --> 00:04:59.910
That's dndbeyond.link/icewind.

00:05:01.633 --> 00:05:04.615
All righty, I think those are our sponsorships.

00:05:04.615 --> 00:05:05.515
We have some quick announcements to get through.

00:05:05.515 --> 00:05:06.991
Marisha, you had something you wanted to talk about.

00:05:06.991 --> 00:05:09.932
MARISHA: Yes, so, you all should join us

00:05:09.932 --> 00:05:13.374
next Tuesday, July 21st

00:05:13.374 --> 00:05:16.848
at 4:00pm Pacific for our next episode--

00:05:16.848 --> 00:05:19.321
it's never not weird-- of Narrative Telephone.

00:05:19.321 --> 00:05:20.401
(cheering)

00:05:20.401 --> 00:05:24.544
Featuring a story, which we have all definitely heard,

00:05:24.544 --> 00:05:26.269
from Travis Willingham.

00:05:26.269 --> 00:05:28.905
ASHLEY: Oh, yeah, woo, so hard.
SAM: Oh, it was so good.

00:05:28.905 --> 00:05:30.844
The twists, the turns.
ASHLEY: Oh, man, what a crazy story.

00:05:30.844 --> 00:05:32.261
TRAVIS: Yeah, the layers.
MARISHA: Brutal.

00:05:32.261 --> 00:05:34.102
ASHLEY: So many layers.

00:05:34.102 --> 00:05:35.829
TRAVIS: All the different facial expressions.

00:05:35.829 --> 00:05:36.895
MARISHA: Yeah, yeah.
LAURA: All of those.

00:05:36.895 --> 00:05:38.342
MATT: The costumes I wore.
SAM: I think we all do.

00:05:38.342 --> 00:05:39.525
MATT: That kind of threw me for a loop.

00:05:39.525 --> 00:05:41.059
LIAM: The first one we got to the end perfectly.

00:05:41.059 --> 00:05:43.531
TRAVIS: The stage blood substitutions that you guys had

00:05:43.531 --> 00:05:45.216
were really ingenious.

00:05:45.216 --> 00:05:48.002
MARISHA: Well, I thought the inclusion of a musical number

00:05:48.002 --> 00:05:49.385
was really inspired.
TRAVIS: Somebody had to do, right?

00:05:49.385 --> 00:05:51.364
ASHLEY: That's true. Somebody had to do it.

00:05:51.364 --> 00:05:52.803
MATT: Well done.

00:05:52.803 --> 00:05:53.928
MARISHA: Yeah.

00:05:53.928 --> 00:05:56.201
Check it out this Tuesday, and the VOD, of course,

00:05:56.201 --> 00:05:57.612
will be available immediately

00:05:57.612 --> 00:05:59.157
for our Twitch channel subscribers

00:05:59.157 --> 00:06:04.065
and will be on YouTube on Thursday as usual.

00:06:04.065 --> 00:06:04.898
Yeah!

00:06:04.898 --> 00:06:06.501
(laughter)

00:06:06.501 --> 00:06:08.596
MATT: Perfect, thank you, Marisha.

00:06:08.596 --> 00:06:09.696
MARISHA: Nailed it.

00:06:09.696 --> 00:06:11.061
MATT: Laura, you had something to talk about.

00:06:11.061 --> 00:06:13.906
LAURA: I did have something to talk about.
MATT: Yes, you did!

00:06:13.906 --> 00:06:18.211
LAURA: In case you guys missed it a few weeks ago,

00:06:18.211 --> 00:06:22.563
we introduced this Funko Pop!

00:06:22.563 --> 00:06:23.820
TRAVIS: She's so pretty.

00:06:23.820 --> 00:06:26.216
LAURA: It's Vex.
TRAVIS: She's so pretty on a broom.

00:06:26.216 --> 00:06:27.862
LAURA: I'm going to take it out of the box.

00:06:27.862 --> 00:06:29.330
SAM: You're going to unbox it?

00:06:29.330 --> 00:06:31.639
LAURA: Yeah, I'm going to unbox myself.

00:06:31.639 --> 00:06:35.432
SAM: It's going to lose half its value.

00:06:35.432 --> 00:06:36.673
LAURA: So yeah, this--

00:06:36.673 --> 00:06:38.515
Ah, she almost fell.

00:06:38.515 --> 00:06:41.997
This beauty will be available.

00:06:41.997 --> 00:06:43.541
I got to read where it's going to be.

00:06:43.541 --> 00:06:46.053
It's going to be available at Best <i>Buy</i>!

00:06:46.053 --> 00:06:46.944
LIAM: Wow.

00:06:46.944 --> 00:06:49.861
(laughter)

00:06:49.861 --> 00:06:53.185
LAURA: And at funko.com.
SAM: You had to read that?

00:06:53.185 --> 00:06:55.290
LAURA: On July 22, you guys.
LIAM: It's going to be at Best...

00:06:55.290 --> 00:06:56.123
Buy.

00:06:56.123 --> 00:06:57.051
ASHLEY: Best <i>Buy</i>.

00:06:57.051 --> 00:07:00.840
LAURA: Best <i>Buy</i>! That's me!

00:07:00.840 --> 00:07:02.717
Shut up.
TRAVIS: I can't believe you had to read that.

00:07:02.717 --> 00:07:05.073
LAURA: I didn't believe it.

00:07:05.073 --> 00:07:06.689
So there you go.

00:07:06.689 --> 00:07:08.133
Check it out.

00:07:08.133 --> 00:07:09.005
MATT: Fantastic.

00:07:09.005 --> 00:07:09.838
LAURA: Oh my god.

00:07:09.838 --> 00:07:11.495
SAM: It's a Funko.
TRAVIS: She's gorgeous.

00:07:11.495 --> 00:07:13.559
LAURA: Thanks.
SAM: She really is.

00:07:13.559 --> 00:07:15.124
LAURA: It's got a witch hat, Sam.

00:07:15.124 --> 00:07:17.513
SAM: I know, I'm so excited about that.
TRAVIS: Is she holding a little coin in her hand?

00:07:17.513 --> 00:07:18.899
LAURA: She's holding a little coin.

00:07:18.899 --> 00:07:19.963
TRAVIS: She's happy.

00:07:19.963 --> 00:07:22.423
LIAM: That is funking incredible.

00:07:22.423 --> 00:07:24.094
ASHLEY: Hey.

00:07:24.094 --> 00:07:26.357
MATT: And on that note, thank you, Laura.

00:07:26.357 --> 00:07:27.891
I believe that brings us to the end of our announcements,

00:07:27.891 --> 00:07:32.381
and as such, let's go ahead and
jump into tonight's episode of

00:07:32.381 --> 00:07:33.384
Critical Role.

00:07:43.595 --> 00:07:45.749

MATT: And welcome back.

00:09:15.581 --> 00:09:16.422
SAM: Maybe.

00:09:16.422 --> 00:09:18.065
TRAVIS: Not even close.

00:09:18.065 --> 00:09:19.860
MATT: Welcome back.

00:09:19.860 --> 00:09:21.994
So last we left off:

00:09:21.994 --> 00:09:24.706
The Mighty Nein had made their way towards Rumblecusp

00:09:24.706 --> 00:09:28.593
to prepare for the coming day of Traveler Con.

00:09:28.593 --> 00:09:31.445
Upon arriving at the strange island noticing a strange mist

00:09:31.445 --> 00:09:33.054
and a dreamlike quality to elements

00:09:33.054 --> 00:09:35.624
of its unexpected topography.

00:09:35.624 --> 00:09:37.758
You encountered a village of individuals there

00:09:37.758 --> 00:09:39.281
from all over Exandria

00:09:39.281 --> 00:09:42.603
that had a difficult time recalling their pasts,

00:09:42.603 --> 00:09:44.394
but seemed exuberant and happy

00:09:44.394 --> 00:09:47.746
with their current day lifestyle here on the island

00:09:47.746 --> 00:09:51.818
worshiping a fire entity, a god, if you will,

00:09:51.818 --> 00:09:56.730
that existed within Rumblecusp's volcano itself.

00:09:56.730 --> 00:09:58.683
You, after meeting with and staying the night

00:09:58.683 --> 00:09:59.516
with these individuals,

00:09:59.516 --> 00:10:01.166
learned a little bit about their culture,

00:10:01.166 --> 00:10:02.739
learned a little bit about the mystery

00:10:02.739 --> 00:10:04.882
of where they may have come from

00:10:04.882 --> 00:10:08.120
and what they do not know or recall,

00:10:08.120 --> 00:10:11.949
and you chose to go ahead and travel on foot

00:10:11.949 --> 00:10:15.975
through the jungle path to meet with this Vokodo,

00:10:15.975 --> 00:10:18.845
this fire god of the island,

00:10:18.845 --> 00:10:21.229
to ask permission to bring the Traveler

00:10:21.229 --> 00:10:24.082
and the various other Traveler followers to the island,

00:10:24.082 --> 00:10:26.805
and you are being accompanied by the spiritual guardian

00:10:26.805 --> 00:10:29.730
of the village of the people there, Viridian,

00:10:29.730 --> 00:10:32.956
a druid figure that seems to be the protector

00:10:32.956 --> 00:10:34.472
of the people there.

00:10:34.472 --> 00:10:37.698
You've traveled extensively for hours through the jungle,

00:10:37.698 --> 00:10:39.085
passed by various dangers,

00:10:39.085 --> 00:10:42.528
watched as the landscape itself grew darker

00:10:42.528 --> 00:10:44.165
and strangely colder,

00:10:44.165 --> 00:10:48.529
dark pits filling the space between the heavy root network

00:10:48.529 --> 00:10:50.727
and dark tar-like liquid

00:10:50.727 --> 00:10:52.489
upon which most of you managed to avoid.

00:10:52.489 --> 00:10:55.243
Caduceus had not quite so luck twice in a row,

00:10:55.243 --> 00:10:59.453
falling into the jaws of the creatures that existed within.

00:10:59.453 --> 00:11:02.905
Pushing deeper into this darker shaded portion

00:11:02.905 --> 00:11:04.947
of the jungle and learning about different elements

00:11:04.947 --> 00:11:09.090
of the island itself being an odd jigsaw puzzle

00:11:09.090 --> 00:11:12.485
of places that probably shouldn't exist on an island

00:11:12.485 --> 00:11:14.342
let alone this one.

00:11:14.342 --> 00:11:18.011
You came across the sound of something creepy,

00:11:18.011 --> 00:11:21.746
like a sobbing sound in the distance.

00:11:21.746 --> 00:11:23.457
MARISHA: It sounded so sad.

00:11:23.457 --> 00:11:26.341
MATT: I know, and upon going to investigate,

00:11:26.341 --> 00:11:28.706
Beauregard quietly threw some ball bearings

00:11:28.706 --> 00:11:32.498
towards the source of this creature

00:11:32.498 --> 00:11:36.479
and then decided to join it in its sorrow.

00:11:36.479 --> 00:11:39.842
Upon which, it seemed a bit perturbed by your presence

00:11:39.842 --> 00:11:44.813
and began to make itself very aggressively known.

00:11:44.813 --> 00:11:47.455
ASHLEY: I don't think it was a bad idea.
MARISHA: Thank you.

00:11:47.455 --> 00:11:48.657
MATT: And that is where we left off.

00:11:48.657 --> 00:11:50.182
I need you all to roll initiative.

00:11:50.182 --> 00:11:53.189
LAURA: Like right on?!

00:11:53.189 --> 00:11:55.639
TRAVIS: Oh my god.
ASHLEY: Ah, jeez.

00:11:55.639 --> 00:11:56.544
TALIESIN: Gosh darn it.

00:11:56.544 --> 00:11:57.782
TRAVIS: Okay, ready.

00:11:57.782 --> 00:12:00.190
SAM: Gosh darn it.
ASHLEY: Gosh dandruff.

00:12:00.190 --> 00:12:01.342
MARISHA: Okay, okay, okay.

00:12:01.342 --> 00:12:02.175
SAM: Oh, we're doing this.

00:12:02.175 --> 00:12:04.710
We're going into combat.

00:12:04.710 --> 00:12:06.705
I'm going to say that this combat combat cam

00:12:06.705 --> 00:12:08.881
is powered by Dwarven Forge.

00:12:08.881 --> 00:12:12.790
You will not want to miss the new
Dwarven Forge Wildlands Kickstarter.

00:12:12.790 --> 00:12:14.835
Join their mailing list as soon as it launches,

00:12:14.835 --> 00:12:18.242

00:12:18.242 --> 00:12:19.825
(exclaiming)

00:12:19.825 --> 00:12:21.150
TRAVIS: Look how good it looks!

00:12:21.150 --> 00:12:22.200
MARISHA: Yeah, it looks so good!

00:12:22.200 --> 00:12:24.033
TRAVIS: It looks so good!

00:12:24.033 --> 00:12:25.170
Oh, there are tar pools.

00:12:25.170 --> 00:12:26.504
MARISHA: Yeah, is that what that is?

00:12:26.504 --> 00:12:30.063
MATT: Yep, those are the various pools
of that tar-like liquid.

00:12:30.063 --> 00:12:32.369
LIAM: What Caduceus kept getting his foot stuck in.

00:12:32.369 --> 00:12:34.893
MARISHA: Just like the La Brea Tar Pits. Yes!

00:12:34.893 --> 00:12:35.886
TRAVIS: They're kind of sentient.

00:12:35.886 --> 00:12:36.719
ASHLEY: We'll go there some time.

00:12:36.719 --> 00:12:37.767
MARISHA: Steve can tell us all about it.

00:12:37.767 --> 00:12:38.600
LAURA: -- in the bottom.

00:12:38.600 --> 00:12:39.771
TRAVIS: Oh, that's right, that's right, that's right.

00:12:39.771 --> 00:12:41.839
MATT: Now, the rest of you are who are holding back

00:12:41.839 --> 00:12:45.153
for the time being,
where abouts are you standing?

00:12:45.153 --> 00:12:46.136
LAURA: I don't know,

00:12:46.136 --> 00:12:47.647
which way did we come from?
TRAVIS: Which direction were we coming, towards you?

00:12:47.647 --> 00:12:50.506
MATT: You guys were heading this direction around this way

00:12:50.506 --> 00:12:51.700
and then began moving this way

00:12:51.700 --> 00:12:53.404
to investigate where the sound was coming from.

00:12:53.404 --> 00:12:55.882
MARISHA: Oh, man, he's already base to base with me.

00:12:55.882 --> 00:12:58.422
TRAVIS: I will-- Does anybody have any--

00:12:58.422 --> 00:12:59.967
LAURA: Can I be up on the--
SAM: No, you go first, Fjord.

00:12:59.967 --> 00:13:01.076
LAURA: Oh, sorry, yeah, you go first.

00:13:01.076 --> 00:13:04.089
TRAVIS: Yeah, I'll swing this side.

00:13:04.089 --> 00:13:04.922
MATT: All right.

00:13:04.922 --> 00:13:07.777
TRAVIS: Yeah, down by that pool bank, if I can.

00:13:07.777 --> 00:13:10.053
SAM and TALIESIN: ♪ Down by the pool bank ♪

00:13:10.053 --> 00:13:11.898
MATT: One more down this way?
TRAVIS: To your right. Yeah, thank you.

00:13:11.898 --> 00:13:12.850
MATT: You got it.

00:13:12.850 --> 00:13:17.533
LAURA: I'll be on this rock on my corner.

00:13:17.533 --> 00:13:18.853
MATT: Back this way?
LAURA: Yeah.

00:13:18.853 --> 00:13:21.207
TRAVIS: I realize putting myself near a pool probably sucks.

00:13:21.207 --> 00:13:22.273
SAM: No, it's fine.
LAURA: Yeah, you can just

00:13:22.273 --> 00:13:23.861
be pushed right into it.

00:13:23.861 --> 00:13:25.706
Pretty awesome.
TALIESIN: You got one save, right?

00:13:25.706 --> 00:13:28.052
You can do one little hop.
TRAVIS: I'm part mermaid, it's cool.

00:13:28.052 --> 00:13:29.506
MATT: All righty.

00:13:29.506 --> 00:13:32.564
SAM: Can I go, which one is this?
TALIESIN: Is that canon?

00:13:32.564 --> 00:13:34.838
SAM: Can I go near this tree?

00:13:34.838 --> 00:13:37.514
MATT: Sure, you guys, we'll say, scattered out a little bit

00:13:37.514 --> 00:13:41.122
as Beauregard began to investigate this.

00:13:41.122 --> 00:13:42.488
Most of you guys would probably be on the side.

00:13:42.488 --> 00:13:43.468
You would not have had enough time

00:13:43.468 --> 00:13:44.614
to encircle the entire space.

00:13:44.614 --> 00:13:45.447
TRAVIS: God, how do we play?

00:13:45.447 --> 00:13:48.758
LIAM: I will go behind this big thick tree right here.

00:13:48.758 --> 00:13:49.591
MATT: Right here?
SAM: Oh yeah,

00:13:49.591 --> 00:13:51.647
but we were togetherish, right?

00:13:51.647 --> 00:13:53.062
LAURA: Yeah, we were.
SAM: It doesn't make sense

00:13:53.062 --> 00:13:55.990
that we spread out.
So put me closer to Jester.

00:13:55.990 --> 00:13:59.940
MATT: Okay, so, I'll put you over in this space?

00:13:59.940 --> 00:14:01.160
SAM: Yeah, near that tree.

00:14:01.160 --> 00:14:02.493
Yeah, perfect, great.

00:14:02.493 --> 00:14:04.393
That makes more sense.

00:14:04.393 --> 00:14:05.226
MATT: Caduceus?

00:14:05.226 --> 00:14:06.559
TALIESIN: Where's Beau?
LAURA: Hi, Veth.

00:14:06.559 --> 00:14:07.392
MATT: Beau is right there.

00:14:07.392 --> 00:14:08.299
SAM: Oh, hi.
TALIESIN: Okay, I would've probably

00:14:08.299 --> 00:14:10.818
been about half way to Beau.

00:14:10.818 --> 00:14:13.583
So, well, I would've been on the other side of that pool

00:14:13.583 --> 00:14:15.068
because fuck those things.

00:14:15.068 --> 00:14:17.027
Here, let me.
MATT: Where abouts?

00:14:17.027 --> 00:14:20.995
That's what the laser pointers are for.

00:14:20.995 --> 00:14:23.231
TALIESIN: See that weird little-- oh god, this is hilarious.

00:14:23.231 --> 00:14:24.953
See that little circle?
MATT: Right here?

00:14:24.953 --> 00:14:26.352
TALIESIN: Yeah, I would've been behind that stone.

00:14:26.352 --> 00:14:27.185
MATT: Okay, like right there?

00:14:27.185 --> 00:14:29.211
TALIESIN: Yeah, about there.

00:14:29.211 --> 00:14:30.825
MATT: Okay, Yasha.

00:14:30.825 --> 00:14:35.825
ASHLEY: Okay, so, I feel like I was kind of near Caduceus.

00:14:35.842 --> 00:14:36.930
MATT: So possibly over on this space?

00:14:36.930 --> 00:14:38.965
ASHLEY: Yeah, so, I'll hang around.

00:14:38.965 --> 00:14:40.305
Yeah, I'll hang out by the tar pool.

00:14:40.305 --> 00:14:42.368
Why not?
MATT: You got it.

00:14:42.368 --> 00:14:44.093
It's a little chilly.

00:14:44.093 --> 00:14:45.661
TALIESIN: Strength saves to get out.

00:14:45.661 --> 00:14:47.608
MARISHA: You look like everyone's favorite aunt right now.

00:14:47.608 --> 00:14:48.607
I love you so much.

00:14:48.607 --> 00:14:50.515
(laughter)

00:14:50.515 --> 00:14:51.355
MATT: That's pretty great.
ASHLEY: Listen,

00:14:51.355 --> 00:14:52.941
the glasses don't work with the outfit, but--

00:14:52.941 --> 00:14:54.763
TRAVIS: They do, shut up.

00:14:54.763 --> 00:14:55.746
TALIESIN: Agree to disagree.

00:14:55.746 --> 00:14:59.329
MARISHA: You definitely teach
drama at the local middle school.

00:14:59.329 --> 00:15:02.088
ASHLEY: Yes.
MATT: All right, 25 to 20.

00:15:02.088 --> 00:15:03.148
SAM: Yeah, 22.

00:15:03.148 --> 00:15:05.065
TRAVIS and LAURA: Nice.
MATT: 22, nice.

00:15:05.978 --> 00:15:08.136
Veth. All right.

00:15:08.136 --> 00:15:10.177
LAURA: Oh no.
SAM: Oh boy.

00:15:10.177 --> 00:15:12.761
LIAM: What medium do you sculpt in?

00:15:12.761 --> 00:15:15.482
TALIESIN: Papier-mâché.
SAM: Papier-mâché, totally.

00:15:15.482 --> 00:15:16.667
MATT: 20 to 15.

00:15:16.667 --> 00:15:17.950
MARISHA: 18.

00:15:17.950 --> 00:15:19.272
TRAVIS: 15.

00:15:19.272 --> 00:15:20.112
Oh shit.

00:15:20.112 --> 00:15:21.265
SAM: Has this--
ASHLEY: I had advantage, too.

00:15:21.265 --> 00:15:22.673
SAM: Well, I'll get to that in a second.

00:15:22.673 --> 00:15:24.589
LAURA: So that was Nott, Fjord--

00:15:24.589 --> 00:15:26.442
MATT: 14 to 10.
TRAVIS: Nott, Beau, Fjord.

00:15:26.442 --> 00:15:27.848
ASHLEY: 13.

00:15:27.848 --> 00:15:29.235
LAURA: 10.
ASHLEY: Okay.

00:15:30.275 --> 00:15:31.320
LAURA: Nott, Beau, Fjord?

00:15:31.320 --> 00:15:34.229
TRAVIS: Yeah, Nott, Beau, Fjord, Yasha, and then Jester?

00:15:34.229 --> 00:15:35.675
LAURA: Yeah.
TALIESIN: Hey, Liam.

00:15:35.675 --> 00:15:37.071
LIAM: Hi, Tal.
MATT: Okay, 10 to five?

00:15:37.071 --> 00:15:38.193
LIAM: Mighty nine!

00:15:38.193 --> 00:15:39.213
TALIESIN: Six.

00:15:39.213 --> 00:15:40.291
ASHLEY: I'm after Fjord?

00:15:40.291 --> 00:15:41.448
LIAM: Six and nine.

00:15:41.448 --> 00:15:42.788
SAM: Yeah.
MARISHA: Nice.

00:15:42.788 --> 00:15:45.771
TRAVIS: Caleb and Caduceus, right?
SAM: (stage whisper) That's a sex thing.

00:15:45.771 --> 00:15:49.831
MATT: All righty, so, top of the round as this strange,

00:15:49.831 --> 00:15:53.700
elongated, gray, fleshy, undead entity

00:15:53.700 --> 00:15:55.429
is now faced right in front of Beauregard.

00:15:55.429 --> 00:15:59.177
Its rotted shawl that rests over the top part of its torso

00:15:59.177 --> 00:16:01.410
revealing this kind of sunken head,

00:16:01.410 --> 00:16:03.632
noseless, these black, eyeless sockets

00:16:03.632 --> 00:16:05.806
with this strange shine on the inside of them,

00:16:05.806 --> 00:16:09.242
and this is elongated, howling mouth of darkness

00:16:09.242 --> 00:16:12.092
right in front going (sucking gasp).

00:16:12.092 --> 00:16:13.872
Veth, you're up first.

00:16:13.872 --> 00:16:16.944
SAM: It hasn't made an aggressive move yet, right?

00:16:16.944 --> 00:16:18.047
MATT: Not yet.

00:16:18.047 --> 00:16:19.389
TRAVIS: I can barely see.

00:16:19.389 --> 00:16:20.847
SAM: I'm far away.
MATT: But it's aggressive

00:16:20.847 --> 00:16:22.242
in the sense that it just (swishes)

00:16:22.242 --> 00:16:23.426
appeared right in front of Beauregard.

00:16:23.426 --> 00:16:26.529
SAM: That's scary, but Beauregard is the coolest.

00:16:26.529 --> 00:16:30.520
So I'm going to play it safe,

00:16:30.520 --> 00:16:35.520
and (startles) I'm going to cast Spider Climb on myself--

00:16:35.581 --> 00:16:36.816
ASHLEY: Nice.
MATT: Okay.

00:16:36.816 --> 00:16:39.849
SAM: -- and scurry up that tree next to me.

00:16:39.849 --> 00:16:42.520
MATT: You got it. Is that concentration?

00:16:42.520 --> 00:16:44.957
SAM: Probably. Why, was I doing something else?

00:16:44.957 --> 00:16:46.874
MATT: No, I'm just--
SAM: It says touch.

00:16:46.874 --> 00:16:48.524
It does not say-- oh, it is concentration, yes.

00:16:48.524 --> 00:16:51.208
MATT: Okay. I'm just putting that on there for you there.

00:16:51.208 --> 00:16:52.050
All righty.

00:16:52.050 --> 00:16:54.520
SAM: Scurry up that tree and if I can, bonus action,

00:16:54.520 --> 00:16:59.008
sort of hide in those-- the foliage.

00:16:59.008 --> 00:17:00.082
MATT: I'll allow it. Go for it.

00:17:00.082 --> 00:17:04.492
Go ahead and roll a stealth check for me, if you don't mind.

00:17:04.492 --> 00:17:06.817
Halfling's too tiny.
SAM: 27.

00:17:06.817 --> 00:17:09.233
MATT: You're pretty hidden.

00:17:09.233 --> 00:17:11.257
SAM: And then I will wait.

00:17:11.257 --> 00:17:15.860
I'm looking at Beau to see if she looks scared or--

00:17:15.860 --> 00:17:17.558
MARISHA: No.
SAM: She's fine, she's fine.

00:17:17.558 --> 00:17:18.392
I'm ready.

00:17:18.392 --> 00:17:19.448
MATT: Okay, you got it.

00:17:19.448 --> 00:17:20.912
So you're holding your action just in case something--

00:17:20.912 --> 00:17:21.895
SAM: There is no action to hold.

00:17:21.895 --> 00:17:22.825
I'm just waiting.

00:17:22.825 --> 00:17:24.269
MATT: Oh, that's right because
you cast, so you're just waiting.

00:17:24.269 --> 00:17:27.179
All right, so, on the initiative count 20,

00:17:27.179 --> 00:17:29.440
you watch as these little flickering flames kind of

00:17:29.440 --> 00:17:31.622
(whooshing thumps)

00:17:31.622 --> 00:17:34.325
out of the black, tar-like substances around,

00:17:34.325 --> 00:17:36.074
and these strange, little, eerie,

00:17:36.074 --> 00:17:39.774
blue flame lights begin to rise out.

00:17:39.774 --> 00:17:44.471
These faint, little, bobbing, blue flames.

00:17:44.471 --> 00:17:46.596
ASHLEY: Well, that's not a good sign.

00:17:46.596 --> 00:17:49.506
LAURA: Like little will-o'-wisps?

00:17:49.506 --> 00:17:50.697
MATT: Something like that, you could say.

00:17:50.697 --> 00:17:53.601
TRAVIS: They're farts underneath the water.

00:17:53.601 --> 00:17:55.925
TALIESIN: More like kill-o'-wisps, am I right?

00:17:55.925 --> 00:17:58.223
LAURA: (laughs exaggeratedly) That's the best one you've

00:17:58.223 --> 00:18:00.158
ever had, Caduceus.

00:18:00.158 --> 00:18:02.349
(laughter)

00:18:02.349 --> 00:18:04.032
TALIESIN: I'm ashamed of myself.

00:18:04.943 --> 00:18:08.437
MATT: They then immediately begin to drift

00:18:08.437 --> 00:18:10.643
towards the nearest source of life.

00:18:10.643 --> 00:18:12.700
MARISHA: Yeah. Like will-o'-wisps.
LAURA: Uh-oh.

00:18:12.700 --> 00:18:14.056
MARISHA: That's great.
LAURA: Uh-oh.

00:18:14.056 --> 00:18:15.219
TRAVIS: Source of light or life?

00:18:15.219 --> 00:18:16.993
Because I'm kind of dark inherently.

00:18:16.993 --> 00:18:18.859
SAM: (laughs)

00:18:18.859 --> 00:18:20.131
Just your personality?

00:18:20.131 --> 00:18:20.964
TRAVIS: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:18:20.964 --> 00:18:23.547
SAM: You're super dark.
TRAVIS: So moody.

00:18:24.741 --> 00:18:27.629
MATT: So as part of that.

00:18:27.629 --> 00:18:30.227
Against you, Fjord, it's going to go ahead and attempt to

00:18:30.227 --> 00:18:32.676
(swooshes) dart in your direction,

00:18:32.676 --> 00:18:33.947
like, towards your shoulder area,

00:18:33.947 --> 00:18:36.111
like it's about to just butt in towards your torso.

00:18:36.111 --> 00:18:37.467
TRAVIS: (yells)

00:18:37.467 --> 00:18:39.302
MATT: Ooh, that's a 24 to hit.

00:18:39.302 --> 00:18:40.469
TRAVIS: That definitely hits.

00:18:40.469 --> 00:18:42.585
MATT: All righty, you take

00:18:45.386 --> 00:18:47.734
13 points of lightning damage as it shocks you.

00:18:47.734 --> 00:18:48.726
SAM: Lightning!
MATT: It comes into contact

00:18:48.726 --> 00:18:51.277
with you and as it does, this jolt arcs

00:18:51.277 --> 00:18:53.369
through your body as a bit of your life force seems

00:18:53.369 --> 00:18:54.814
to have been (puffs) pulled out from the impact.

00:18:54.814 --> 00:18:56.647
TRAVIS: Let me give it to you. (shuddering yell)

00:18:56.647 --> 00:18:57.480
MATT: There you go, perfect.

00:18:57.480 --> 00:18:58.888
Thank you.
MARISHA: Nice.

00:18:58.888 --> 00:19:01.346
MATT: The one moving towards you, Yasha.

00:19:01.346 --> 00:19:03.482
That's going to be a 19 to hit.

00:19:03.482 --> 00:19:05.240
TRAVIS: That'll gif well.
ASHLEY: (blows) 19 hits.

00:19:05.240 --> 00:19:06.440
MATT: All righty.

00:19:06.440 --> 00:19:09.229
You take eight points of lightning damage

00:19:09.229 --> 00:19:11.923
as it also swoops in towards your body,

00:19:11.923 --> 00:19:13.286
and you try and move out of the way,

00:19:13.286 --> 00:19:15.059
and you technically dodge its impact,

00:19:15.059 --> 00:19:16.807
but it's about a foot away and, still,

00:19:16.807 --> 00:19:19.383
these arcs of lightning (sizzles) arc off of it

00:19:19.383 --> 00:19:20.300
and blast to your body,

00:19:20.300 --> 00:19:22.008
and you feel your muscles tense from the pain

00:19:22.008 --> 00:19:24.851
as you pull away and the sparks dissipate.

00:19:24.851 --> 00:19:27.233
TRAVIS: No saves, by the way.

00:19:27.233 --> 00:19:28.258
SAM: Oh.

00:19:28.258 --> 00:19:29.265
MATT: Caduceus.

00:19:29.265 --> 00:19:30.951
SAM: Those were just a melee attack.
MARISHA: Lightning attack.

00:19:30.951 --> 00:19:31.967
MATT: Yeah, it's rolling to hit you.

00:19:31.967 --> 00:19:33.815
TALIESIN: I don't think I'm next.
TRAVIS: Oh, that's right, yeah.

00:19:33.815 --> 00:19:34.757
MATT: No, it's attacking you--

00:19:34.757 --> 00:19:36.649
TALIESIN: Oh, okay, that's fine.

00:19:36.649 --> 00:19:38.162
MATT: That's going to be a 17 to hit.

00:19:38.162 --> 00:19:39.146
TALIESIN: That misses.

00:19:39.146 --> 00:19:40.274
MATT: It does, nice!

00:19:40.274 --> 00:19:41.890
So as this one now comes towards you,

00:19:41.890 --> 00:19:44.315
you bring the shield up and the electricity actually arcs

00:19:44.315 --> 00:19:46.387
off the exterior metal parts of the shield.

00:19:46.387 --> 00:19:48.469
It absorbs it, no actual damage done to you.

00:19:48.469 --> 00:19:52.710
TALIESIN: I can't use one of the Shield--

00:19:52.710 --> 00:19:54.460
boy, I'm out of it--

00:19:54.460 --> 00:19:55.483
Shield of Retribution on this?

00:19:55.483 --> 00:19:57.149
MATT: If you'd like to. If you have the ability to do so.

00:19:57.149 --> 00:19:58.834
LAURA: You're coordinating so well right now, Taliesin.

00:19:58.834 --> 00:20:00.425
TALIESIN: Sure.

00:20:00.425 --> 00:20:01.483
MATT: Beau, you're on deck, by the way.

00:20:01.483 --> 00:20:03.637
LAURA: The hair and his shirt and his backdrop.
LIAM: Backdrop.

00:20:03.637 --> 00:20:05.235
TALIESIN: "When a creature misses you with a melee attack--"

00:20:05.235 --> 00:20:07.818
It's not a melee attack, is it? Or is it?

00:20:08.711 --> 00:20:09.694
Was that a melee attack?

00:20:09.694 --> 00:20:10.535
MATT: It was, yes.

00:20:10.535 --> 00:20:14.456
TALIESIN: So I use my reaction to
blast him with arcane force.

00:20:14.456 --> 00:20:16.961
You get 4d6 damage.
TRAVIS: Ooh!

00:20:16.961 --> 00:20:19.211
MATT: All right, go ahead and roll damage.

00:20:19.211 --> 00:20:20.379
SAM: That's hardcore.

00:20:20.379 --> 00:20:22.272
TALIESIN: It's pretty cool, it's pretty cool.

00:20:22.272 --> 00:20:23.105
There we are.
LAURA: I think these are undead.

00:20:23.105 --> 00:20:25.089
MATT: This is force damage, you said, right?

00:20:25.089 --> 00:20:26.841
TALIESIN: Arcane-- force damage.

00:20:26.841 --> 00:20:28.715
MATT: Yep.

00:20:28.715 --> 00:20:30.493
TALIESIN: So that's (counting)--

00:20:30.493 --> 00:20:31.909
TRAVIS: Sure feels like a good candidate.

00:20:31.909 --> 00:20:33.901
TALIESIN: 14 points of force damage.

00:20:33.901 --> 00:20:36.623
MATT: 14 points.
TALIESIN: And a strength saving throw.

00:20:36.623 --> 00:20:38.623
MATT: Strength saving throw.

00:20:39.764 --> 00:20:41.342
It rolled a natural 20--

00:20:41.342 --> 00:20:42.465
ALL: Ooh!

00:20:42.465 --> 00:20:45.864
MATT: -- but with the modifier, it's a 15.

00:20:45.864 --> 00:20:48.355
SAM: It has a negative five?
TALIESIN: That's my spell save, right?

00:20:48.355 --> 00:20:50.033
Spell save is 17.

00:20:50.033 --> 00:20:52.011
MATT: Is there not one put on the shield?

00:20:52.011 --> 00:20:52.937
TALIESIN: That's actually a good question.

00:20:52.937 --> 00:20:53.770
Hold on.

00:20:56.422 --> 00:20:58.665
No, a strength saving throw or be pushed.

00:20:58.665 --> 00:21:00.165
Oh wait-- no.

00:21:01.812 --> 00:21:03.997
MATT: Okay, if you can't find one, for now we'll use yours.

00:21:03.997 --> 00:21:05.217
So, yeah, we'll say it works.

00:21:05.217 --> 00:21:07.153
TALIESIN: Pushed 20 feet away from me.

00:21:07.153 --> 00:21:08.899
MATT: All right, so it gets pushed.
TRAVIS: Look how pretty those trees are, you guys.

00:21:08.899 --> 00:21:11.229
MATT: It jams into the tree behind

00:21:11.229 --> 00:21:13.531
and vanishes inside of it

00:21:13.531 --> 00:21:15.943
before slowly emerging from the outer side,

00:21:15.943 --> 00:21:17.122
right below where Nott is.

00:21:17.122 --> 00:21:18.308
TALIESIN: Jerk.
ASHLEY: Nice.

00:21:18.308 --> 00:21:21.714
MATT: All righty, now, Beau, it is your turn.

00:21:21.714 --> 00:21:22.738
MARISHA: Okay, so this thing just--

00:21:22.738 --> 00:21:23.847
MATT: At the top of your turn,

00:21:23.847 --> 00:21:25.896
MARISHA: Yeah, yeah.
TRAVIS: Uh-oh.

00:21:25.896 --> 00:21:27.961
MATT: I need you to make a constitution saving throw.

00:21:27.961 --> 00:21:28.794
MARISHA: Why?

00:21:28.794 --> 00:21:30.223
TRAVIS: Because it's got a big ol' mouth.

00:21:30.223 --> 00:21:31.056
LIAM: Yep,
SAM: Oh, no.

00:21:31.056 --> 00:21:34.863
MATT: Because you are now staring
directly into its gaping face.

00:21:34.863 --> 00:21:36.062
TRAVIS: Really, that's the problem?

00:21:36.062 --> 00:21:37.062
LIAM: It's kind of depressing to look at.

00:21:37.062 --> 00:21:39.273
MARISHA: Oh, that's real bad, seven.

00:21:39.273 --> 00:21:41.651
MATT: Seven!
SAM: But can't you do monk stuff?

00:21:41.651 --> 00:21:42.515
MATT: Oh no.

00:21:42.515 --> 00:21:43.895
TRAVIS: Oh no!

00:21:43.895 --> 00:21:46.445
MATT: You guys watch as Beauregard puts her fists up,

00:21:46.445 --> 00:21:49.503
looks into its face, and her eyes go white,

00:21:49.503 --> 00:21:51.047
and she drops to the ground, unconscious.

00:21:51.047 --> 00:21:53.539
TRAVIS: No!
ASHLEY: What?!

00:21:53.539 --> 00:21:55.301
LIAM: You just dropped.
TRAVIS: Unconscious?!

00:21:55.301 --> 00:21:56.541
MATT: You're at zero hit points.

00:21:56.541 --> 00:21:59.479
TRAVIS: My dope monk shit can't fix that.

00:21:59.479 --> 00:22:01.173
SAM: Oh shit.

00:22:01.173 --> 00:22:02.464
ASHLEY: What?

00:22:04.448 --> 00:22:08.306
SAM: Is she rolling death saves
or she's just out and stable?

00:22:08.306 --> 00:22:09.394
We don't know?
MATT: You don't know.

00:22:09.394 --> 00:22:10.957
SAM: We don't know.

00:22:10.957 --> 00:22:13.039
MATT: So, Beau, it's the end of your turn.

00:22:13.039 --> 00:22:15.183
I need you to roll a death saving throw.

00:22:15.183 --> 00:22:16.266
MARISHA: Well, that answered the question.

00:22:16.266 --> 00:22:17.123
SAM: Well, that answered that.

00:22:17.123 --> 00:22:19.745
(laughter)

00:22:19.745 --> 00:22:21.513
MARISHA: Death save, 12.

00:22:21.513 --> 00:22:22.346
MATT: 12, okay.

00:22:22.346 --> 00:22:24.475
That's one success on you there.

00:22:24.475 --> 00:22:25.756
Fjord, you're up.

00:22:25.756 --> 00:22:26.682
Yasha, you're on deck.
MARISHA: This is the last time I try

00:22:26.682 --> 00:22:29.439
to relate to somebody.
TRAVIS: Don't you come to me that fast!

00:22:29.439 --> 00:22:30.272
All right.

00:22:32.950 --> 00:22:35.959
I will run over to Beau,

00:22:35.959 --> 00:22:38.734
use all 30 feet to get on over there.

00:22:38.734 --> 00:22:40.924
MATT: (counting)
SAM: Does that thing get to attack him or anything?

00:22:41.799 --> 00:22:44.114
TRAVIS: Yeah, so I get a attack
of opportunity from the flame?

00:22:44.114 --> 00:22:44.947
MATT: Yes, it does.

00:22:44.947 --> 00:22:47.762
It gets one strike on you as a reaction.

00:22:47.762 --> 00:22:49.916
That is going to be a 12 to hit.

00:22:49.916 --> 00:22:50.749
TRAVIS: That misses!
MATT: Yep.

00:22:50.749 --> 00:22:53.467
(whooshes) Manage to just avoid the arc's energy,

00:22:53.467 --> 00:22:55.223
(sizzles) goes across the ground,

00:22:55.223 --> 00:22:56.380
and you dodge right out of the way

00:22:56.380 --> 00:22:58.306
as you rush around and head towards Beauregard.

00:22:58.306 --> 00:22:59.808
TRAVIS: I see Beau fall to the ground,

00:22:59.808 --> 00:23:01.414
and I go into a baseball slide,

00:23:01.414 --> 00:23:02.632
and I slide across the ground,

00:23:02.632 --> 00:23:05.006
and I place a hand on her, and I'll do Lay on Hands--

00:23:05.006 --> 00:23:05.993
LIAM: Yeah.
SAM: Yes.

00:23:05.993 --> 00:23:10.216
MARISHA: Fuck, yes.
TRAVIS: -- and restore two hit points.

00:23:10.216 --> 00:23:11.623
MATT: Okay, there you go.

00:23:11.623 --> 00:23:12.456
Hey, that's conscious.

00:23:12.456 --> 00:23:13.289
TRAVIS: Yep.
MARISHA: I'll take it.

00:23:13.289 --> 00:23:14.411
LIAM: Just a defibrillator.

00:23:14.411 --> 00:23:16.092
Can't say that word.

00:23:16.092 --> 00:23:18.494
TRAVIS: That's my action, as my bonus action,

00:23:18.494 --> 00:23:21.992
I'll look up and cast Hexblade's Curse right in its face.

00:23:21.992 --> 00:23:22.825
MATT: Right on its face, you got it.

00:23:22.825 --> 00:23:24.594
TRAVIS: On the thing, yeah.

00:23:24.594 --> 00:23:25.677
MATT: All righty.

00:23:26.534 --> 00:23:27.406
TRAVIS: Okay.

00:23:28.331 --> 00:23:30.842
MATT: As you, on the ground, you see Beauregard

00:23:30.842 --> 00:23:33.647
(gasping) come to life with a deep breath.

00:23:33.647 --> 00:23:35.618
As you turn your hand back towards it, you see its face.

00:23:35.618 --> 00:23:39.378
It's already put into shadow, these little green veins

00:23:39.378 --> 00:23:42.229
begin to reach up inside, glowing the underside

00:23:42.229 --> 00:23:44.136
of its neck, and that represents your Hexblade's Curse.

00:23:44.136 --> 00:23:46.558
The element of the Wild Mother drawing

00:23:46.558 --> 00:23:49.798
into its necrotic presence to dig deeper into its body.

00:23:49.798 --> 00:23:51.557
TRAVIS: Is it just darkness in its mouth?

00:23:51.557 --> 00:23:53.486
MATT: Yeah, it's just a void of darkness.

00:23:53.486 --> 00:23:54.614
LAURA: That's terrifying.

00:23:54.614 --> 00:23:55.457
MATT: That finish your turn, Fjord?

00:23:55.457 --> 00:23:56.646
TRAVIS: It does.

00:23:56.646 --> 00:23:57.972
Yeah, it's my max move.

00:23:57.972 --> 00:23:59.967
MATT: Yasha, you're up.
ASHLEY: Okay, so, I'm going

00:23:59.967 --> 00:24:02.425
to run over to Beau.

00:24:02.425 --> 00:24:06.391
MATT: Okay, up to just to back of her, or--?

00:24:06.391 --> 00:24:07.695
ASHLEY: I kind of--

00:24:09.888 --> 00:24:13.365
Let me go to where I could maybe also attack?

00:24:13.365 --> 00:24:14.523
MATT: Yeah, you have the enough movement to do that

00:24:14.523 --> 00:24:15.443
with Beauregard over here.
ASHLEY: Yeah, yeah, yeah, okay.

00:24:15.443 --> 00:24:16.429
Plus I have Mobile, too.

00:24:16.429 --> 00:24:20.229
MATT: There, yeah, we got two people with 50 speed movement.

00:24:20.229 --> 00:24:21.062
It's crazy.

00:24:21.062 --> 00:24:23.827
The will-o'-wisp does get an attack of opportunity on you

00:24:23.827 --> 00:24:26.046
as you dart out of its space.

00:24:26.046 --> 00:24:29.163
Ooh, wow, that's a 21 to hit.

00:24:29.163 --> 00:24:30.250
ASHLEY: Yeah.

00:24:30.250 --> 00:24:32.713
MATT: You take 11 points of lightning damage

00:24:32.713 --> 00:24:34.437
as you feel it hit you from behind,

00:24:34.437 --> 00:24:36.625
but you just grit your teeth and keep running.

00:24:36.625 --> 00:24:40.820
ASHLEY: Okay, I'm going to lean down to Beau

00:24:40.820 --> 00:24:43.481
and use Healing Hands on her,

00:24:43.481 --> 00:24:45.241
which will heal you for 12 hit points.

00:24:45.241 --> 00:24:46.244
SAM: What, what is this?

00:24:46.244 --> 00:24:47.910
TRAVIS: It's not a competition, okay?

00:24:47.910 --> 00:24:50.341
ASHLEY: It's a competition.
(laughter)

00:24:50.341 --> 00:24:51.200
Okay, so--

00:24:51.200 --> 00:24:53.998
MARISHA: Oh, yeah, keep tapping me.

00:24:53.998 --> 00:24:55.423
ASHLEY: And then--

00:24:57.748 --> 00:24:59.734
do I-- bonus attack.

00:24:59.734 --> 00:25:02.059
I'm going to attack it.

00:25:02.059 --> 00:25:03.136
LAURA: (singing Yakety Sax)

00:25:03.136 --> 00:25:05.303
MATT: Your Healing Hands is an action?

00:25:05.303 --> 00:25:06.402
ASHLEY: It's an action.

00:25:06.402 --> 00:25:07.870
MATT: So you have no action to attack.

00:25:07.870 --> 00:25:09.398
ASHLEY: I can't do that, that's fine.

00:25:09.398 --> 00:25:11.960
I'm going to just hover over Beau.

00:25:11.960 --> 00:25:13.091
MATT: Okay, you still have a bonus action

00:25:13.091 --> 00:25:13.924
if you want to do anything.

00:25:13.924 --> 00:25:15.174
LAURA: (whispering) Can you rage?

00:25:16.983 --> 00:25:19.047
TRAVIS: I think you can rage as a bonus, right?

00:25:19.047 --> 00:25:20.354
ASHLEY: Ooh, thank you.

00:25:20.354 --> 00:25:21.517
I'm going to rage.

00:25:21.517 --> 00:25:23.375
MATT: Okay, there you go. I know it's been a while.

00:25:23.375 --> 00:25:25.856
♪ It's been a while ♪
TRAVIS: I got you, fam.

00:25:25.856 --> 00:25:27.829
MATT: All righty, so,
ASHLEY: Thanks, guys.

00:25:27.829 --> 00:25:30.287
MATT: So as you get up, now both Fjord

00:25:30.287 --> 00:25:33.700
and Yasha flanking Beauregard staring at this creature,

00:25:33.700 --> 00:25:36.343
you feel the adrenaline surge through your system,

00:25:36.343 --> 00:25:37.801
and your eyes narrow, your teeth grit.

00:25:37.801 --> 00:25:39.886
TRAVIS: Being able to get the fuck out of here.
LAURA: Yeah.

00:25:39.886 --> 00:25:41.464
MATT: It's now the creature's turn, if you're done.

00:25:41.464 --> 00:25:42.595
LAURA: Oh, god.

00:25:42.595 --> 00:25:44.023
TRAVIS: Cool, all three of us, hey.

00:25:44.023 --> 00:25:45.261
MARISHA: (laughs)

00:25:45.261 --> 00:25:47.462
ASHLEY: Yeah, I'm done.
MATT: The creature now

00:25:47.462 --> 00:25:49.887
hasn't really moved its head from where Beauregard dropped.

00:25:49.887 --> 00:25:53.970
As you guys moved in, it still stood there, still.

00:25:57.204 --> 00:26:02.204
Okay. Its head turns in one rapid motion.

00:26:02.361 --> 00:26:03.365
You don't even see the transition.

00:26:03.365 --> 00:26:04.795
Its head is just suddenly facing forward.

00:26:04.795 --> 00:26:06.282
LAURA: Oh, no, I hate that.
MATT: I need you to make--

00:26:06.282 --> 00:26:08.564
LAURA: That's Ring girl shit.
MATT: -- a constitution saving throw for me, Fjord.

00:26:08.564 --> 00:26:10.595
SAM: That's Travis' favorite.

00:26:10.595 --> 00:26:11.644
MARISHA: It's going to be bad.

00:26:11.644 --> 00:26:13.705
TRAVIS: That's actually not terrible.

00:26:13.705 --> 00:26:15.030
That's cocked.
MATT: Cocked, yeah.

00:26:16.204 --> 00:26:17.878
TRAVIS: Ugh. Terrible, nine.

00:26:17.878 --> 00:26:21.279
MATT: Nine. As you look into its open mouth,

00:26:21.279 --> 00:26:25.873
you hear this horrible sucking sound

00:26:25.873 --> 00:26:27.620
that gets higher pitched, and as it does,

00:26:27.620 --> 00:26:29.796
all of the world around you just goes dark,

00:26:29.796 --> 00:26:31.482
and you feel this horrible burning sound

00:26:31.482 --> 00:26:33.927
as something is pulled from you from the inside.

00:26:33.927 --> 00:26:35.992
You suffer--

00:26:35.992 --> 00:26:37.742
SAM: Not dead, not dead.

00:26:39.208 --> 00:26:41.163
MATT: Let's see here.

00:26:41.163 --> 00:26:43.037
ASHLEY: What the heck is this thing?

00:26:43.037 --> 00:26:43.962
LAURA: I hate it.

00:26:43.962 --> 00:26:45.287
ASHLEY: Me, too!

00:26:51.337 --> 00:26:56.329
TRAVIS: Less dice, please. Less dice, small number.

00:26:57.401 --> 00:27:00.297
I am friend.

00:27:00.297 --> 00:27:01.720
MATT: 48 points of necrotic damage.

00:27:01.720 --> 00:27:05.020
TRAVIS: (splutters)
(laughter)

00:27:05.020 --> 00:27:08.353
MATT: As your vision goes into this dark tunnel

00:27:08.353 --> 00:27:12.804
and then returns, your whole body is pulsing

00:27:12.804 --> 00:27:15.639
with intense pain rooted deep in your system

00:27:15.639 --> 00:27:16.918
that you haven't felt before,

00:27:16.918 --> 00:27:19.417
and you feel like a part of you is just gone.

00:27:19.417 --> 00:27:22.201
TRAVIS: (laughs) I'm just sad.

00:27:22.201 --> 00:27:24.955
SAM: We avoided a dragon turtle,

00:27:24.955 --> 00:27:26.457
and we just walked up to this one.

00:27:26.457 --> 00:27:28.032
(laughter)

00:27:28.032 --> 00:27:30.421
LAURA: Bet it changed your max hit points.

00:27:30.421 --> 00:27:33.050
MATT: It just stands there, looking at Fjord still.

00:27:33.050 --> 00:27:35.387
It doesn't look afraid, it's not moving.

00:27:35.387 --> 00:27:38.783
It's just waiting for you to come to it.

00:27:38.783 --> 00:27:40.255
That brings us to Jester's turn.

00:27:40.255 --> 00:27:41.455
Caleb, you're on deck.
LIAM: Okay.

00:27:41.455 --> 00:27:43.757
TRAVIS: We need to get the fuck out.
MARISHA: Yeah, we should just go.

00:27:43.757 --> 00:27:45.465
SAM: Jessie, you're up.

00:27:45.465 --> 00:27:47.240
LAURA: I just thought of something, and

00:27:47.240 --> 00:27:49.433
it's so not appropriate

00:27:49.433 --> 00:27:50.612
and I want to do it.

00:27:50.612 --> 00:27:51.527
MATT: Do it.

00:27:51.527 --> 00:27:54.468
LAURA: No, because everybody's in danger.

00:27:54.468 --> 00:27:57.161
MATT: That's the best time to do something inappropriate.

00:27:57.161 --> 00:27:59.203
LAURA: I'm going to run forward

00:27:59.203 --> 00:28:02.711
and get in front of Caduceus

00:28:02.711 --> 00:28:04.544
so I'm within 30 feet.

00:28:05.477 --> 00:28:08.553
MATT: 25, 30, you can't quite get in front of him.

00:28:08.553 --> 00:28:09.528
You can get over here, maybe,

00:28:09.528 --> 00:28:11.031
but you'll be in melee with the will-o'-wisp.

00:28:11.031 --> 00:28:11.864
LAURA: That's okay.

00:28:11.864 --> 00:28:13.454
MATT: You have to get over the
trunk to get over there, anyway.

00:28:13.454 --> 00:28:15.634
LAURA: Okay.
MATT: So you can get there.

00:28:15.634 --> 00:28:19.869
LAURA: Okay, hold on because this-- oh, god.

00:28:19.869 --> 00:28:21.739
This changes what I was going to do.

00:28:21.739 --> 00:28:23.213
This is dumb.

00:28:23.213 --> 00:28:24.981
SAM: Use Vex's broom to fly over there.

00:28:24.981 --> 00:28:27.481
LAURA: Zoom!

00:28:29.689 --> 00:28:30.522
Hold on.

00:28:30.522 --> 00:28:31.999
SAM: Dumb is the best, do dumb.

00:28:31.999 --> 00:28:33.441
TRAVIS: (laughs) I love the check in,

00:28:33.441 --> 00:28:36.450
like the visual look of "Hey, is this okay?"

00:28:36.450 --> 00:28:38.165
We don't know what it is.

00:28:38.165 --> 00:28:39.475
(laughter)

00:28:39.475 --> 00:28:42.490
TRAVIS: "It's okay, right?" What is it?

00:28:42.490 --> 00:28:44.473
MATT: What you got, Laura?

00:28:44.473 --> 00:28:46.934
SAM: While she's thinking, we must admire your shirt

00:28:46.934 --> 00:28:49.225
for a moment.
LAURA: This is so stupid!

00:28:49.225 --> 00:28:51.598
I'm going to try to use the Wand of Smiles on it.

00:28:51.598 --> 00:28:52.565
SAM: Yeah.

00:28:52.565 --> 00:28:53.907
MATT: Okay, all right, all right.

00:28:53.907 --> 00:28:54.870
MARISHA: I am so here for this.

00:28:54.870 --> 00:28:55.703
ASHLEY: Okay.

00:28:55.703 --> 00:28:58.119
MATT: What's the saving throw it has to make?
MARISHA: It feels adjacent to what I was doing.

00:28:58.119 --> 00:29:00.348
LAURA: Oh god, oh no,

00:29:00.348 --> 00:29:01.181
that's so terrible!

00:29:01.181 --> 00:29:02.733
It's a low save!

00:29:02.733 --> 00:29:03.566
It's a real low save!

00:29:03.566 --> 00:29:04.817
MATT: If you don't want to do it, you don't have to do it.

00:29:04.817 --> 00:29:06.429
LAURA: I'm not going to do it!
SAM: Do it!

00:29:06.429 --> 00:29:07.435
LAURA: No, I'm not going to do it.

00:29:07.435 --> 00:29:09.081
I'm going to Turn Undead.

00:29:09.081 --> 00:29:10.532
I'm going to Destroy Undead.

00:29:10.532 --> 00:29:11.425
MATT: Okay, all right.

00:29:11.425 --> 00:29:12.879
LAURA: I have no idea if these are undead.

00:29:12.879 --> 00:29:15.235
MATT: The save on that is?

00:29:15.235 --> 00:29:16.436
LAURA: 17.
MARISHA: (laughs)

00:29:16.436 --> 00:29:17.769
MATT: That's cocked.

00:29:18.863 --> 00:29:20.457
That's a nine.

00:29:20.457 --> 00:29:22.298
LAURA: Oh, then they fail it.

00:29:22.298 --> 00:29:23.784
MATT: They do.
LAURA: Are they undead?

00:29:24.701 --> 00:29:26.784
MATT: It is undead, yes.

00:29:26.784 --> 00:29:29.371
But at what--
LAURA: At-- okay, okay.

00:29:29.371 --> 00:29:30.869
TRAVIS: Wait, but there was a but.

00:29:30.869 --> 00:29:33.655
MATT: Well, the Destroy Undead itself has a specific--
LAURA: Destroy Undead happens

00:29:33.655 --> 00:29:37.293
if it's a-- two or lower.
LIAM: Challenge Rating.

00:29:37.293 --> 00:29:38.952
MATT: Yeah, it's much higher DC that that,

00:29:38.952 --> 00:29:39.785
LAURA: Yeah, yeah.

00:29:39.785 --> 00:29:40.942
MATT: But it does turn it.

00:29:40.942 --> 00:29:43.667
LAURA: Yes, I don't know if the will-o'-wisp thingies

00:29:43.667 --> 00:29:47.166
are undead either, but anything within 30 feet of me.

00:29:47.166 --> 00:29:48.355
MATT: Within 30 feet of you?

00:29:48.355 --> 00:29:50.956
So the one that's right in front of you.

00:29:50.956 --> 00:29:52.306
LIAM: You turned the big one?
TALIESIN: There's a couple.

00:29:52.306 --> 00:29:54.581
MATT: And there's one that's underneath Veth.

00:29:54.581 --> 00:29:55.983
So they will both make saves--

00:29:55.983 --> 00:29:57.921
TRAVIS: Had a little too many vegetables.
MATT: -- and both fail!

00:29:57.921 --> 00:30:00.232
LAURA: Okay! That's something.
TALIESIN: What's their Challenge Rating?

00:30:00.232 --> 00:30:02.569
MATT: Those wisps, you watch as the two flames

00:30:02.569 --> 00:30:04.817
that are flickering there-- (poof)

00:30:04.817 --> 00:30:06.393
and the lights are snuffed.

00:30:06.393 --> 00:30:08.008
ASHLEY and MARISHA: Yes!
LAURA: Okay.

00:30:08.008 --> 00:30:08.933
SAM: All right, all right.

00:30:08.933 --> 00:30:11.839
TALIESIN: So this thing on its turn--
TRAVIS: Away?

00:30:11.839 --> 00:30:13.080
TALIESIN: Full fucking speed away from us.

00:30:13.080 --> 00:30:14.697
SAM: I broke my feet.
TRAVIS: Away from Jester or all of us?

00:30:14.697 --> 00:30:15.746
TALIESIN: Away from Jester.

00:30:15.746 --> 00:30:17.158
LAURA: Away from me.

00:30:17.158 --> 00:30:19.677
TRAVIS: Ooh, this island's fucking weird.

00:30:19.677 --> 00:30:22.507
SAM: Did the big bad take any damage?

00:30:22.507 --> 00:30:24.506
LAURA: He got turned but he didn't get destroyed.

00:30:24.506 --> 00:30:25.994
TALIESIN: Yeah, he's going to run.

00:30:25.994 --> 00:30:27.664
TRAVIS: Somebody turned the power off to the island,

00:30:27.664 --> 00:30:29.202
and the dinosaurs are running amok.

00:30:29.202 --> 00:30:30.798
(laughter)

00:30:30.798 --> 00:30:32.747
MATT: So that finish your turn, Jester?

00:30:32.747 --> 00:30:34.362
That was your movement, your action, you have a bonus still.

00:30:34.362 --> 00:30:36.779
LAURA: For my bonus action, can I do a spell?

00:30:36.779 --> 00:30:39.070
MATT: Yeah, because Channel Divinity is not a spell.
TRAVIS: Somebody find Dennis Nedry.

00:30:39.070 --> 00:30:40.228
LAURA: Oh, great, then I'm going to--

00:30:40.228 --> 00:30:41.756
MARISHA: UNIX! I know this.
LAURA: For my bonus action,

00:30:41.756 --> 00:30:45.747
I'm going to cast Spiritual Weapon

00:30:47.714 --> 00:30:50.386
at 4th-level,

00:30:50.386 --> 00:30:52.676
so it's got my serrated lollipop.

00:30:52.676 --> 00:30:55.443
MATT: Slick, and we'll put it right on the other,

00:30:55.443 --> 00:30:56.430
next to Fjord?

00:30:56.430 --> 00:30:58.991
LAURA: I'm going to put it-- yeah, next to the guy.

00:30:58.991 --> 00:31:01.138
TRAVIS: ♪ I'm going to make your lollipop ♪
LAURA: But I want to look and see

00:31:01.138 --> 00:31:04.013
if I hit him, does it break the turn undead?

00:31:04.013 --> 00:31:05.965
It's not like that, it's not like a charm.

00:31:07.232 --> 00:31:08.246
TALIESIN: I don't think it does.

00:31:08.246 --> 00:31:10.527
I think there's nothing, it's just run no matter what.

00:31:10.527 --> 00:31:11.360
LAURA: It's just got it.

00:31:11.360 --> 00:31:12.818
So I'm going to try to hit him.
MATT: Let me double check on that one.

00:31:12.818 --> 00:31:13.661
LAURA: Okay.

00:31:13.661 --> 00:31:15.386
TRAVIS: ♪ I'mma take you to the candy shop. ♪

00:31:15.386 --> 00:31:17.101
LAURA: "If the creature fails its

00:31:17.101 --> 00:31:19.234
MATT: Turns for one minute, or until it takes any damage.
LAURA: "-- or until it takes any damage."

00:31:19.234 --> 00:31:21.149
Okay, okay, okay.

00:31:21.149 --> 00:31:24.769
So I'll just protect my friends with my spiritual weapon,

00:31:24.769 --> 00:31:26.027
but I won't hit it.

00:31:26.027 --> 00:31:27.102
MATT: Okay, there you go.

00:31:27.102 --> 00:31:28.783
That finishes Jester's turn.
TRAVIS: Nice.

00:31:28.783 --> 00:31:30.165
MATT: Caleb, you're up. Caduceus, you're on deck.
TRAVIS: High five.

00:31:30.165 --> 00:31:32.950
LIAM: Are there any of the glowing blue balls left?

00:31:32.950 --> 00:31:35.714
MATT: None that you can see.

00:31:35.714 --> 00:31:37.289
LIAM: Shoot, so, I'm behind this tree.

00:31:37.289 --> 00:31:38.122
I saw none of that.

00:31:38.122 --> 00:31:39.336
I don't know what's going on.

00:31:39.336 --> 00:31:42.989
So he would step out diagonally to his right

00:31:42.989 --> 00:31:43.973
to see what is going on.

00:31:43.973 --> 00:31:45.244
MATT: You look over here,

00:31:45.244 --> 00:31:47.013
and you can immediately see there is Beauregard

00:31:47.013 --> 00:31:51.493
on the ground, eyes open and just getting up to her elbows

00:31:51.493 --> 00:31:53.180
from a prone position.

00:31:53.180 --> 00:31:56.238
Yasha and Fjord both there facing off with this creature,

00:31:56.238 --> 00:31:58.568
Jester's spiritual weapon apparates in the air,

00:31:58.568 --> 00:32:01.003
but isn't taking any notion yet, and that's all you see.

00:32:01.003 --> 00:32:04.621
LIAM: Okay, so seeing that and calculating very quickly,

00:32:04.621 --> 00:32:08.787
I will start muttering and take a bite of licorice root

00:32:08.787 --> 00:32:11.279
and cast Haste on Beauregard.

00:32:11.279 --> 00:32:12.691
TRAVIS: Nice.
MATT: Okay, gotcha.

00:32:12.691 --> 00:32:14.940
So, Beau, you are hasted.

00:32:14.940 --> 00:32:16.698
TRAVIS: Yes.

00:32:16.698 --> 00:32:17.908
MARISHA: Yes.

00:32:17.908 --> 00:32:19.231
MATT: We'll put a blue one on you.

00:32:19.231 --> 00:32:20.411
That's fun.

00:32:20.411 --> 00:32:22.472
MARISHA: That's speed times two?

00:32:22.472 --> 00:32:24.451
MATT: Speed times two.
LIAM: Your AC goes up.

00:32:24.451 --> 00:32:26.462
MATT: By two.
LIAM: You get an extra action.

00:32:26.462 --> 00:32:27.493
MATT: I think advantage on dex saves?

00:32:27.493 --> 00:32:28.326
Is that how it works?
LIAM: Yes.

00:32:28.326 --> 00:32:30.369
MATT: And yeah, the extra action for a single attack

00:32:30.369 --> 00:32:31.343
or anything else you want to try.

00:32:31.343 --> 00:32:33.109
LIAM: Plus two to AC.

00:32:33.109 --> 00:32:35.242
MARISHA: Plus two to AC.
LIAM: Advantage on dex saves.

00:32:35.242 --> 00:32:36.770
MARISHA: Oh, yes, you're the best.

00:32:36.770 --> 00:32:38.522
LIAM: Additional action on each turn.

00:32:38.522 --> 00:32:39.888
MATT: You got it.

00:32:39.888 --> 00:32:41.038
So that's 10 feet of movement.

00:32:41.038 --> 00:32:43.268
LIAM: "The action can be used only to take the attack,

00:32:43.268 --> 00:32:44.690
"dash, disengage, hide--"

00:32:44.690 --> 00:32:46.465
Yeah, 10 feet of movement,

00:32:47.699 --> 00:32:49.332
and I'll go back behind the tree.

00:32:49.332 --> 00:32:50.922
TRAVIS: I love playing this fucking game.

00:32:50.922 --> 00:32:52.588
Look at these guys.
LIAM: 76 hit points, everybody.

00:32:52.588 --> 00:32:54.683
TRAVIS: It's so great.

00:32:54.683 --> 00:32:57.433
MATT: All right, Caduceus, you're up.

00:32:59.191 --> 00:33:01.004
At the beginning of your turn,
MARISHA: Oh, I can do this.

00:33:01.004 --> 00:33:02.508
I can do this.

00:33:02.508 --> 00:33:04.021
MATT: I need you to make a constitution
saving throw for me, please.

00:33:04.021 --> 00:33:05.441
LAURA: Caduceus, why Caduceus?

00:33:05.441 --> 00:33:06.761
TRAVIS: Because he can see it?

00:33:06.761 --> 00:33:08.424
MATT: You glance past and you can see into its eyes.

00:33:08.424 --> 00:33:10.489
You can see this dark black hole--

00:33:10.489 --> 00:33:13.592
TALIESIN: Can it do that even when under Turn Undead?

00:33:13.592 --> 00:33:16.033
MATT: Yeah, it's not--

00:33:18.250 --> 00:33:19.250
It's not an action it takes.

00:33:19.250 --> 00:33:20.083
TALIESIN: Okay, It's just a thing.

00:33:20.083 --> 00:33:21.523
TRAVIS: Oh shit.

00:33:22.657 --> 00:33:24.303
TALIESIN: 20.
SAM: Oh wow.

00:33:24.303 --> 00:33:25.803
MATT: Okay, all right.

00:33:26.901 --> 00:33:29.849
TALIESIN: I think I do take half
damage or something like that.

00:33:29.849 --> 00:33:31.809
LIAM: You're going to be okay.

00:33:31.809 --> 00:33:33.756
LAURA: We're going to be fine, we're going to be fine.

00:33:33.756 --> 00:33:35.213
MATT: Okay, so nothing happens.

00:33:35.213 --> 00:33:36.204
You're fine.

00:33:36.204 --> 00:33:38.983
You do gather, as you pull your eyes away from it

00:33:38.983 --> 00:33:41.871
for a second, that there is something about its gaze,

00:33:41.871 --> 00:33:44.913
something about its eyes and that connection

00:33:44.913 --> 00:33:46.354
that tried to reach into your soul

00:33:46.354 --> 00:33:48.409
and you just managed to shrug it off.

00:33:48.409 --> 00:33:49.761
So what are you doing with your turn?

00:33:49.761 --> 00:33:51.894
TALIESIN: I'm going to yell at everybody:

00:33:51.894 --> 00:33:54.425
Don't look at its eyes, don't look at its eyes!

00:33:54.425 --> 00:33:56.979
Don't look in there, oh man.

00:33:56.979 --> 00:33:58.262
MARISHA: It's his mouth.

00:33:58.262 --> 00:33:59.412
His eyes were very pretty.

00:33:59.412 --> 00:34:00.274
It's his mouth.

00:34:00.274 --> 00:34:02.105
TALIESIN: And let's see--

00:34:02.105 --> 00:34:04.284
TRAVIS: You got a purdy mouth.
(laughter)

00:34:04.284 --> 00:34:06.099
ASHLEY: You got a purdy mouth.

00:34:06.099 --> 00:34:08.475
MATT: That's the best post-date conversation.

00:34:08.475 --> 00:34:12.136
It's not the eyes, it's the mouth.

00:34:12.136 --> 00:34:14.610
TALIESIN: And I'm going to cast Bless

00:34:16.453 --> 00:34:18.103
at 3rd-level--

00:34:18.103 --> 00:34:21.404
MATT: All righty.
TALIESIN: -- for myself, Beau, Fjord,

00:34:21.404 --> 00:34:25.499
Jester, and Yasha. Just everyone who's in the thick of it.

00:34:25.499 --> 00:34:26.949
SAM: Smart, smart.
ASHLEY: What is it?

00:34:26.949 --> 00:34:29.423
TALIESIN: You get an extra d4 on--

00:34:29.423 --> 00:34:31.805
MATT: Attacks and saving throws.
TALIESIN: -- attacks and saves.

00:34:31.805 --> 00:34:32.721
MATT: Okay, so who was it?

00:34:32.721 --> 00:34:34.723
Yasha, Beau, and who else?

00:34:34.723 --> 00:34:39.723
TALIESIN: Myself, Yasha, Beau, Fjord, Jester.

00:34:39.769 --> 00:34:41.189
Everyone who's in the midst.

00:34:41.189 --> 00:34:42.475
TRAVIS: What did we get?
ASHLEY: Thanks, Caduceus.

00:34:42.475 --> 00:34:44.379
LAURA: Blessed.
TRAVIS: Blessed.

00:34:44.379 --> 00:34:45.418
Plus four to?

00:34:45.418 --> 00:34:47.101
LAURA: Attacks and saving throws.

00:34:47.101 --> 00:34:48.521
TALIESIN: I think we should run.

00:34:48.521 --> 00:34:53.521
I think we should run, and I'm going to start backing off.

00:34:53.649 --> 00:34:54.613
MATT: At this point, all right.

00:34:54.613 --> 00:34:56.290
That finishes your turn?

00:34:56.290 --> 00:34:59.254
TALIESIN: Unless, yeah, I want to move a little

00:34:59.254 --> 00:35:00.758
further away from this thing.

00:35:00.758 --> 00:35:02.508
I want to be about--

00:35:09.269 --> 00:35:12.249
Actually, yeah, I'm just going
to move five feet to the left,

00:35:12.249 --> 00:35:14.169
10 feet to the left.

00:35:14.169 --> 00:35:16.511
MATT: All right, this way?

00:35:16.511 --> 00:35:17.635
TALIESIN: The other left, sorry,

00:35:17.635 --> 00:35:18.468
MATT: There you go.

00:35:18.468 --> 00:35:20.202
TALIESIN: Then maybe back a bit
if there's not a puddle there.

00:35:20.202 --> 00:35:21.635
I can't quite see.
MATT: You can get right there,

00:35:21.635 --> 00:35:23.534
and then before that, you start
getting in to puddle territory.

00:35:23.534 --> 00:35:25.168
TALIESIN: Let me stay on the rocks.

00:35:25.168 --> 00:35:26.213
That's a little close.

00:35:26.213 --> 00:35:27.980
LAURA: (laughs) Can I stay on the rocks?

00:35:27.980 --> 00:35:29.749
MATT: All right, there you go.
TRAVIS: ♪ Stay on the rocks ♪

00:35:34.627 --> 00:35:36.829
the druid who's been traveling with you,

00:35:36.829 --> 00:35:39.360
comes rushing up from the side where you guys were

00:35:39.360 --> 00:35:40.843
to see this scenario.

00:35:40.843 --> 00:35:41.823

00:35:58.975 --> 00:36:03.975
and as she clenches her fist, clouds begin to (rumbles)

00:36:04.159 --> 00:36:07.130
roil in the sky above, and then she brings her hand down

00:36:07.130 --> 00:36:08.378
to the ground like that.

00:36:08.378 --> 00:36:10.666
You watch as one bolt of energy goes (sizzles)

00:36:10.666 --> 00:36:12.636
out of this cloud and slams into the creature.

00:36:12.636 --> 00:36:15.094

00:36:41.699 --> 00:36:44.988

00:36:44.988 --> 00:36:46.330

TRAVIS: 3d10.

00:36:51.596 --> 00:36:53.246
MATT: All right, so, it takes some lightning damage.

00:36:53.246 --> 00:36:54.188
You see it move quickly.

00:36:54.188 --> 00:36:55.263
It's been standing there this whole time.

00:36:55.263 --> 00:36:56.234
As soon as the bolt of energy comes,

00:36:56.234 --> 00:36:59.901
it looks up (gasps) and seems to dart to the side

00:36:59.901 --> 00:37:02.421
and it impacts right to side of the creature.

00:37:02.421 --> 00:37:03.254
It still shocks it,

00:37:03.254 --> 00:37:06.167
but it manages to reduce the damage that it took.

00:37:06.167 --> 00:37:07.416

SAM: It's a little rough.

shocks from the inside.

out of the way, and you duck as it just glides overhead

00:40:44.724 --> 00:40:47.181
and is now floating just slightly above you right now,

and I'm looking towards the bolt,

00:41:29.278 --> 00:41:33.430

00:41:37.115 --> 00:41:38.814
So you're averting your gaze?

MARISHA: (unsure) Yes.
MATT: Okay.

00:41:40.265 --> 00:41:41.619
(laughter)
MARISHA: I'm looking at its stomach

00:41:41.619 --> 00:41:43.480
and not its dank mouth.
MATT: Just wanted to confirm.

00:41:43.480 --> 00:41:47.113
LIAM: Caduceus warned us.
MATT: Based on Caduceus' warning...

00:41:47.113 --> 00:41:49.689

LIAM: Shouted it out.

00:41:49.689 --> 00:41:51.202
MARISHA: I already did this once.

00:41:51.202 --> 00:41:52.302
MATT: I understand.

00:41:52.302 --> 00:41:55.218
All right, so, you go ahead and make your attacks on it.

00:41:55.218 --> 00:41:56.109
Because you are averting your gaze,

00:41:56.109 --> 00:41:57.991
your attacks are with disadvantage.

00:41:57.991 --> 00:41:59.157
MARISHA: What? Oh.

00:41:59.157 --> 00:42:00.776
TALIESIN: But you add a d4.

00:42:00.776 --> 00:42:02.028
MARISHA: Okay, yeah.
SAM: Yeah, that makes sense.

00:42:02.028 --> 00:42:04.642
MARISHA: Pop pop. I'm going to try and just go

00:42:04.642 --> 00:42:07.284
and just beat the bolt further in it.

00:42:07.284 --> 00:42:09.650
MATT: Go for it.
MARISHA: I don't know, disadvantage

00:42:11.560 --> 00:42:13.914
with a d4-- oh, yucky.

00:42:13.914 --> 00:42:15.131
That's bad.

00:42:16.149 --> 00:42:19.918
Well. Four, five, six, seven. 17?

00:42:19.918 --> 00:42:21.026
MATT: 17 hits.

00:42:21.992 --> 00:42:24.276
MARISHA: I love you. Hugs!
TALIESIN: I love you.

00:42:24.276 --> 00:42:27.053
MARISHA: (exclaims) Okay, no, I wasn't expecting--

00:42:27.053 --> 00:42:28.221
I don't know what to do now.

00:42:28.221 --> 00:42:31.002
Okay, hang on, d8.

00:42:31.002 --> 00:42:35.952
Okay, nine damage, right?

00:42:35.952 --> 00:42:37.611
Yeah, that's what-- nine!

00:42:37.611 --> 00:42:39.386
MATT: Nine damage, all righty.

00:42:40.241 --> 00:42:41.923
MARISHA: Sorry, I wasn't expecting to hit.

00:42:41.923 --> 00:42:44.436
Pop pop again.

00:42:44.436 --> 00:42:46.967
That's both 16s plus three.

00:42:46.967 --> 00:42:48.835
So, nine, 29.

00:42:48.835 --> 00:42:49.668
MATT: 29 hits.

00:42:49.668 --> 00:42:51.246
MARISHA: Best <i>Buy</i>.
LAURA: Jesus.

00:42:51.246 --> 00:42:53.122
ASHLEY: Best <i>Buy</i>!

00:42:53.122 --> 00:42:56.116
MARISHA: 11 damage, great.
LIAM: Best Buy, July 15th.

00:42:56.116 --> 00:42:57.521
LAURA: July 22nd.
MARISHA: I have another action?

00:42:57.521 --> 00:42:59.185
So I'm going to pop pop again.

00:42:59.185 --> 00:43:01.137
MATT: Well, it's a single attack.

00:43:01.137 --> 00:43:02.749
MARISHA: Oh, I'm going to single attack again.

00:43:02.749 --> 00:43:04.310
MATT: So, pop pop, pop.

00:43:04.310 --> 00:43:05.821
LIAM: I want to hold it so bad.
MARISHA: Pop pop, pop.

00:43:05.821 --> 00:43:06.737
LAURA: I know.

00:43:06.737 --> 00:43:08.762
MARISHA: 11 plus...

00:43:10.311 --> 00:43:11.144
one.

00:43:11.144 --> 00:43:12.371
So, 12, 22?

00:43:12.371 --> 00:43:13.512
MATT: 22 hits.

00:43:17.496 --> 00:43:18.458
MARISHA: 13 damage.

00:43:18.458 --> 00:43:19.958
MATT: All righty.

00:43:21.292 --> 00:43:22.132
Okay?

00:43:22.132 --> 00:43:23.449
MARISHA: Flurry of Beaus.

00:43:23.449 --> 00:43:25.199
MATT: Go for it. Two more strikes.
MARISHA: I'm just

00:43:25.199 --> 00:43:26.614
punching through its abdomen.

00:43:26.614 --> 00:43:28.743
MATT: You're just Ip Manning it.
MARISHA: Just fuck this ghost.

00:43:30.476 --> 00:43:32.010
SAM: Ghost punch.
MARISHA: Still at disadvantage, yeah?

00:43:32.010 --> 00:43:34.025
LAURA: Aim for his dick!

00:43:34.025 --> 00:43:38.180
MARISHA: Okay, I hear that, and I start for his balls--

00:43:38.180 --> 00:43:39.442
TRAVIS: Speed bagging?
MARISHA: -- where his balls would be.

00:43:39.442 --> 00:43:40.529
TALIESIN: Speed bagging.

00:43:41.562 --> 00:43:44.099
MARISHA: Ooh, yucky, that's a natural one.

00:43:44.099 --> 00:43:45.109
LAURA: Oh no.
MATT: Ooh.

00:43:45.109 --> 00:43:47.108
Well, this makes sense because there are no balls there.

00:43:47.108 --> 00:43:51.489
As you go to swing, (whooshes) it's smooth as a Ken doll.

00:43:51.489 --> 00:43:54.025
MARISHA: Wrong direction! He has no dick! I shout.

00:43:54.025 --> 00:43:56.083
MATT: This man has no dick.
MARISHA: And... (laughs)

00:43:56.083 --> 00:43:57.980
(laughter)

00:43:57.980 --> 00:43:59.303
Pop pop.

00:43:59.303 --> 00:44:00.541
SAM: More popping?
MATT: You have one more attack.

00:44:00.541 --> 00:44:01.822
MARISHA: Huh?
MATT: You have one more attack.

00:44:01.822 --> 00:44:02.655
MARISHA: I have one more attack?

00:44:02.655 --> 00:44:05.506
MATT: Your Flurry of Blows was two more strikes, right?

00:44:05.506 --> 00:44:07.951
MARISHA: Yes, yeah.

00:44:07.951 --> 00:44:08.947
MATT: Yeah, so you have one more.

00:44:08.947 --> 00:44:11.025
MARISHA: But I did my bonus attack, right?

00:44:11.025 --> 00:44:11.958
MATT: Correct. You did--
MARISHA: Was just this.

00:44:11.958 --> 00:44:14.193
MATT: -- your first two
attacks, then your bonus attack--

00:44:14.193 --> 00:44:15.243
MARISHA: Which just missed.
MATT: -- and then you did Flurry of Blows,

00:44:15.243 --> 00:44:16.192
which is two more.
MARISHA: So, two more attacks.

00:44:16.192 --> 00:44:18.511
MATT: Correct, well, you just did one.
ASHLEY: Damn! That is so crazy.

00:44:18.511 --> 00:44:19.950
LIAM: Was one of those the hasted attack?

00:44:19.950 --> 00:44:21.258
MARISHA: Yeah, one of them was a hasted one

00:44:21.258 --> 00:44:23.591
because I haven't done my Flurry of Beaus yet.

00:44:23.591 --> 00:44:25.941
MATT: Okay.
MARISHA: Right?

00:44:25.941 --> 00:44:27.649
MATT: You did nine, 11, 13 damage,

00:44:27.649 --> 00:44:28.739
but then you missed on one attack.

00:44:28.739 --> 00:44:29.763
So that's four attacks you've gone through.

00:44:29.763 --> 00:44:32.935
MARISHA: Okay, so, last pop.
MATT: Yeah, this is the last one.

00:44:32.935 --> 00:44:35.543
MARISHA: That's better.

00:44:38.966 --> 00:44:39.840
17?

00:44:39.840 --> 00:44:41.257
MATT: 17 hits.
LAURA: Ooh!

00:44:42.758 --> 00:44:47.758
MARISHA: And that's an eight for a beautiful 13.

00:44:48.133 --> 00:44:50.293
MATT: 13 points of damage, great.

00:44:50.293 --> 00:44:52.026
MARISHA: And then--

00:44:52.026 --> 00:44:53.637
SAM: Two more attacks.

00:44:53.637 --> 00:44:55.832
MATT: (laughs)
MARISHA: I--

00:44:55.832 --> 00:44:57.715
LAURA: And then I'm going to fly 120 feet.

00:44:57.715 --> 00:44:58.548
MATT: Yep.

00:44:58.548 --> 00:45:00.278
(laughter)

00:45:00.278 --> 00:45:02.028
LIAM: 100 episodes later.

00:45:03.377 --> 00:45:05.226
TRAVIS: Always.
MARISHA: So I can spend

00:45:05.226 --> 00:45:09.242
my Mind of Mercury to buy-- no, that's a reaction.

00:45:09.242 --> 00:45:10.411
Never mind, never mind.

00:45:10.411 --> 00:45:13.344
I will-- I have a bonus action?

00:45:13.344 --> 00:45:14.798
MATT: No, you've already use that for your Flurry.

00:45:14.798 --> 00:45:16.842
MARISHA: Okay, right, I'm done.

00:45:16.842 --> 00:45:18.045
MATT: You're done, okay.

00:45:18.045 --> 00:45:19.192
End of your turn,

00:45:19.192 --> 00:45:20.650
because this is something that I

00:45:20.650 --> 00:45:21.966
should have been keeping track of,

00:45:21.966 --> 00:45:24.138
but have not.

00:45:24.138 --> 00:45:26.628
After the impact of the attacks from Beauregard

00:45:26.628 --> 00:45:29.436
(thumping) (groaning)

00:45:29.436 --> 00:45:31.412
you watch as the air around it grows dark

00:45:31.412 --> 00:45:33.830
at the end of your turn, and all of a sudden,

00:45:33.830 --> 00:45:35.679
everyone in proximity just feels like more

00:45:35.679 --> 00:45:37.716
of their life force being yanked out of their body.

00:45:37.716 --> 00:45:39.307
LAURA: Oh no.

00:45:39.307 --> 00:45:40.997
What is the proximity?

00:45:40.997 --> 00:45:44.142
MATT: Yes, Beauregard, Yasha, and Fjord...

00:45:44.142 --> 00:45:45.897
TALIESIN: All with a d4.

00:45:45.897 --> 00:45:46.842
MATT: There's no save here.

00:45:46.842 --> 00:45:48.633
You all take eight points of necrotic damage

00:45:48.633 --> 00:45:50.709
from just the surrounding dark aura around it.

00:45:50.709 --> 00:45:53.499
ASHLEY: But I'm resistant to necrotic.
MATT: So you take four.

00:45:53.499 --> 00:45:55.261
ASHLEY: So I take four.

00:45:55.261 --> 00:45:58.791
LAURA: Marisha, were you adding
a four to all of those attacks?

00:45:58.791 --> 00:46:00.088
Because you're blessed.

00:46:00.088 --> 00:46:00.921
MATT: No, she was.

00:46:00.921 --> 00:46:01.954
LAURA: Okay, okay.
MATT: In fact, one of them

00:46:01.954 --> 00:46:02.886
hit only because of that.

00:46:02.886 --> 00:46:04.447
LAURA: Okay, okay, okay.
MARISHA: Attack and saves, yes.

00:46:04.447 --> 00:46:05.769
ASHLEY: Girl, you're blessed.

00:46:05.769 --> 00:46:08.229
LAURA: Because, girl, you're blessed.

00:46:08.229 --> 00:46:09.375
MATT: All righty.
TALIESIN: I'm on it.

00:46:09.375 --> 00:46:10.344
MATT: Finishing Beau's turn.

00:46:10.344 --> 00:46:12.387
Fjord, you're up, Yasha, you're on deck.

00:46:12.387 --> 00:46:15.387
TRAVIS: Okay, (humming).

00:46:15.387 --> 00:46:19.987
I am going to summon the Star Razor

00:46:19.987 --> 00:46:21.185
and activate it,

00:46:21.185 --> 00:46:22.210
MATT: All right (shushes)

00:46:22.210 --> 00:46:23.833
the sword appears in your hand.
SAM: Star Razor activate!

00:46:23.833 --> 00:46:27.765
TRAVIS: And I will cast Banishing Smite

00:46:27.765 --> 00:46:30.661
as a bonus action at 5th-level.

00:46:30.661 --> 00:46:32.152
MATT: You got it.

00:46:32.152 --> 00:46:37.040
TRAVIS: And I will take two strikes against this thing,

00:46:37.040 --> 00:46:39.009
not looking at it, with disadvantage.

00:46:39.009 --> 00:46:40.056
MATT: Okay, so, averting your gaze,

00:46:40.056 --> 00:46:41.150
you do take disadvantage on those strikes.

00:46:41.150 --> 00:46:42.877
Go for it, first attack.

00:46:42.877 --> 00:46:45.411
TALIESIN: And you get a d4, which I will say every time

00:46:45.411 --> 00:46:46.403
no matter who's doing what.
MATT: Yeah, man.

00:46:46.403 --> 00:46:48.219
No, cleric's about being

00:46:48.219 --> 00:46:49.549
Clippy the Clip.

00:46:49.549 --> 00:46:50.607
TALIESIN: It's just going to keep happening.

00:46:50.607 --> 00:46:52.532
TRAVIS: Plus four or a d4?

00:46:52.532 --> 00:46:53.706
TALIESIN: d4.
MATT: Plus a d4.

00:46:53.706 --> 00:46:55.262
TRAVIS: Plus a d4, okay.

00:46:55.262 --> 00:46:57.220
So-- hold on.

00:46:57.220 --> 00:47:00.586
It's been a second. Attack.

00:47:03.215 --> 00:47:05.957
Plus two is 14.

00:47:05.957 --> 00:47:08.280
LAURA: Wish we knew what his strengths and weaknesses were.

00:47:08.280 --> 00:47:09.343
MATT: That's a d6 you just rolled. d4.

00:47:09.343 --> 00:47:11.568
SAM: Well, we know that

00:47:11.568 --> 00:47:13.281
it doesn't have a dick.
LIAM: I'm going to guess necrotic

00:47:13.281 --> 00:47:14.947
not good against it.

00:47:14.947 --> 00:47:16.207
TRAVIS: What's a d4 look like?

00:47:16.207 --> 00:47:18.132
It's a triangle, right?
MATT: It's the pyramid, yeah.

00:47:18.132 --> 00:47:20.260
TRAVIS: Do I not have a fucking pyramid?

00:47:20.260 --> 00:47:22.413
MATT: Did it get lost in the shuffle?

00:47:22.413 --> 00:47:23.843
TRAVIS: Throw me a pyramid.

00:47:23.843 --> 00:47:24.967
LAURA: What?
TRAVIS: Throw me a d4.

00:47:24.967 --> 00:47:26.899
MATT: Laura, you do it, since you guys are--

00:47:26.899 --> 00:47:27.770
SAM: You can touch.

00:47:27.770 --> 00:47:30.187
MATT: Yeah, you're a pod.
LAURA: Ready?

00:47:31.866 --> 00:47:32.991
Four!

00:47:32.991 --> 00:47:33.999
TRAVIS: Four.
MATT: Yep.

00:47:35.093 --> 00:47:38.224
TRAVIS: So that is 27 to hit.

00:47:38.224 --> 00:47:39.791
MATT: That definitely hits.
SAM: Jesus.

00:47:39.791 --> 00:47:41.699
TRAVIS: Okay, so, that is

00:47:41.699 --> 00:47:46.699
5d10, right, something damage.

00:47:47.015 --> 00:47:49.210
SAM: (laughs)
TRAVIS: Cool, sorry.

00:47:49.210 --> 00:47:51.321
SAM: Expert level D&amp;D player.
MATT: So you rolled damage on the weapon, right?

00:47:51.321 --> 00:47:52.978
TRAVIS: I rolled damage on the weapon, okay.

00:47:52.978 --> 00:47:54.856
MATT: Plus your Hexblade's Curse damage.

00:47:54.856 --> 00:47:57.225
TRAVIS: (like Travis) I've lost my d4
and I don't know what I'm doing.

00:47:57.225 --> 00:47:59.124
(laughter)
TRAVIS: Holy shit.

00:47:59.124 --> 00:48:01.928
Seriously, I am out of it.
LAURA: He only has one d4.

00:48:01.928 --> 00:48:05.348
SAM: I mean, to be fair, I do, too.
TRAVIS: Okay, nine plus seven is 16

00:48:05.348 --> 00:48:08.450
plus four for Hexblade's Curse.
TALIESIN: It's a weird die, to be fair.

00:48:08.450 --> 00:48:11.914
TRAVIS: So, 20, and then 5d10.

00:48:11.914 --> 00:48:13.857
ASHLEY: Damn.
TRAVIS: Seven, 27.

00:48:13.857 --> 00:48:16.273
SAM: You want to try my flask, Laura?

00:48:16.273 --> 00:48:19.512
TRAVIS: 31, yes, 38.
MARISHA: Were there chunks?

00:48:19.512 --> 00:48:20.345
LIAM: Could you strain out the--

00:48:20.345 --> 00:48:22.720
TRAVIS: 10, 48.
SAM: I think I left some wine

00:48:22.720 --> 00:48:24.253
in there last time.

00:48:24.253 --> 00:48:26.910
TRAVIS: 51 points of damage.

00:48:26.910 --> 00:48:29.029
SAM: And it's just vinegar.
TALIESIN: What kind of damage?

00:48:29.029 --> 00:48:30.721
TRAVIS: It's got a fucking thing next to it.

00:48:30.721 --> 00:48:33.136
It looks like a comet or a meteor.

00:48:33.136 --> 00:48:34.654
TALIESIN: Radiant, I think.

00:48:34.654 --> 00:48:35.904
MATT and TALIESIN: Force.

00:48:35.904 --> 00:48:37.520
TRAVIS: Force, and if it drops it

00:48:37.520 --> 00:48:40.745
below 50 hit points, does it?

00:48:40.745 --> 00:48:41.733
MATT: How do you want to do this?

00:48:41.733 --> 00:48:43.983
(cheering)

00:48:45.895 --> 00:48:49.394
TRAVIS: Damn, I was not anticipating that.

00:48:49.394 --> 00:48:52.216
I'll just summon the Razor and then just go like

00:48:52.216 --> 00:48:56.299
(whimpers and impact) and just
take it from collar bone to hip,

00:48:56.299 --> 00:49:00.440
just diagonal, long cross guard sash.
MATT: You guys watch as this large arc

00:49:00.440 --> 00:49:03.777
of faintly green radiant energy swings off the blade

00:49:03.777 --> 00:49:05.207
as it converts to a force blast.

00:49:05.207 --> 00:49:07.667
As it impacts, the blade doesn't even reach the flesh

00:49:07.667 --> 00:49:08.783
of the undead creature.

00:49:08.783 --> 00:49:10.958
The force of the magic actually begins tearing it apart

00:49:10.958 --> 00:49:12.515
before the blade can cut into it,

00:49:12.515 --> 00:49:14.534
and you watch as it just scatters into four

00:49:14.534 --> 00:49:15.542
or five different pieces.

00:49:15.542 --> 00:49:18.030
What looks like rags, now, thrown against the ground

00:49:18.030 --> 00:49:21.075
and turn to ash crumbling away.

00:49:21.075 --> 00:49:22.123
The creature is destroyed.

00:49:22.123 --> 00:49:25.863
TRAVIS: Ooh! I regain some hit points with that.

00:49:25.863 --> 00:49:27.326
SAM: Nicely done, Fjord.

00:49:27.326 --> 00:49:28.192
TRAVIS: Thank you.

00:49:28.192 --> 00:49:30.113
SAM: Wait, what about the little will-o'-the-wispies?

00:49:30.113 --> 00:49:31.689
MATT: Yeah, there is one little will-o'-wisp
right next to Fjord.

00:49:31.689 --> 00:49:33.408
You have your second attack, if you want.

00:49:33.408 --> 00:49:35.404
TRAVIS: Oh, I do?
MATT: Yeah.

00:49:35.404 --> 00:49:36.587
TRAVIS: Because I started with one melee,

00:49:36.587 --> 00:49:39.123
I guess I can do one Eldritch Blast, right?

00:49:39.123 --> 00:49:40.409
MATT: No, your action either is

00:49:40.409 --> 00:49:42.367
two attacks or it's two Eldritch Blasts--

00:49:42.367 --> 00:49:43.630
or three Eldritch Blasts.
TRAVIS: It's not--

00:49:43.630 --> 00:49:45.363
Is it near me? Oh, it is. He's in my lane.

00:49:45.363 --> 00:49:47.726
So I'll spin around and make an attack.

00:49:47.726 --> 00:49:48.802
TALIESIN: Fly swatter.

00:49:48.802 --> 00:49:50.774
TRAVIS: I will look at him.

00:49:50.774 --> 00:49:52.905
MATT: You can do that. (laughs)

00:49:52.905 --> 00:49:55.346
LAURA: (like wisp) What, why, no, I wasn't.

00:49:55.346 --> 00:49:56.653
I was just coming to say hi.

00:49:56.653 --> 00:49:58.472
TRAVIS: 23.
MATT: 23 hits.

00:49:58.472 --> 00:50:00.505
(laughter)

00:50:00.505 --> 00:50:01.977
LIAM: (high-pitched) Hee hee!

00:50:01.977 --> 00:50:03.778
(laughter)

00:50:03.778 --> 00:50:06.033
TRAVIS: Oh, I reroll ones.

00:50:06.033 --> 00:50:09.728
Four plus seven is 11.

00:50:09.728 --> 00:50:13.266
MATT: 11 points of damage to that one.

00:50:13.266 --> 00:50:14.240
LIAM: (like wisp) You don't want to hit me.

00:50:14.240 --> 00:50:18.398
TRAVIS: And I regain-- Man, this shit's all over the place.

00:50:18.398 --> 00:50:21.959
I regain 15 hit points because the thing

00:50:21.959 --> 00:50:24.021
on my Hexblade's Curse d-d-died.

00:50:24.021 --> 00:50:24.854
MATT: It did.

00:50:24.854 --> 00:50:27.039
That one, I believe, had already suffered damage,

00:50:27.039 --> 00:50:29.764
that will-o'-wisp, and so (fluffs).
LIAM: (like wisp) I'm so wispy!

00:50:29.764 --> 00:50:32.503
MATT: That one scatters

00:50:32.503 --> 00:50:34.688
and a moment of silence falls upon the battlefield

00:50:34.688 --> 00:50:38.034
here as you all stand ready for the next thing

00:50:38.034 --> 00:50:41.335
to go ahead and arrive and assail you,

00:50:41.335 --> 00:50:42.771
and after a moment--
TALIESIN: Eyes of the Grave?

00:50:42.771 --> 00:50:44.666
MATT: Eyes of the Grave. You look around yourself.

00:50:44.666 --> 00:50:48.361
You sense that nothing at the moment

00:50:48.361 --> 00:50:51.268
is challenging the place where you guys are standing.

00:50:51.268 --> 00:50:54.186
For the time being, you seem to be somewhat safe.

00:50:54.186 --> 00:50:56.604
TALIESIN: Okay, I think we're pretty cool right now.

00:50:56.604 --> 00:50:58.271
LAURA: What was that?

00:50:58.271 --> 00:51:00.695
SAM: What happened? Beauregard, you wandered off,

00:51:00.695 --> 00:51:02.272
and what the hell was that?

00:51:02.272 --> 00:51:03.598
MARISHA: It looked sad.

00:51:03.598 --> 00:51:05.431
I tried to be nice because it looked sad.

00:51:05.431 --> 00:51:06.305
Fuck that shit.

00:51:06.305 --> 00:51:08.351
Fuck that, I'm never doing that shit again.

00:51:08.351 --> 00:51:10.559
MATT: The roiling cloud above fades and Viridian goes,

00:51:10.559 --> 00:51:11.636
"I'm so sorry.

00:51:11.636 --> 00:51:16.623
"I don't normally traverse on foot, and it's strange.

00:51:16.623 --> 00:51:19.602
"This specter, I've not seen, but heard story of,

00:51:19.602 --> 00:51:23.063
"and it's supposed to be from the north and by the Ruin.

00:51:23.063 --> 00:51:26.514
"Normally, I've not heard of it traveling as far south."

00:51:26.514 --> 00:51:29.570
LAURA: What could've made it travel?

00:51:29.570 --> 00:51:30.820
MATT: "I don't know."

00:51:32.380 --> 00:51:35.575
SAM: Maybe it heard about Traveler Con.
LAURA: Beau, I'm going to cast Cure Wounds.

00:51:35.575 --> 00:51:36.689
Oh, wait, shit, no.

00:51:36.689 --> 00:51:38.006
I don't think I have it prepared.

00:51:38.006 --> 00:51:39.426
TRAVIS: An early access badge.

00:51:39.426 --> 00:51:41.831
SAM: Yeah, it wants to go to Traveler Con.

00:51:41.831 --> 00:51:42.739
LAURA: Shut up, you guys.

00:51:42.739 --> 00:51:44.825
LIAM: It's like right on speed dial.

00:51:44.825 --> 00:51:45.961
TRAVIS: How many hit points do you have?

00:51:45.961 --> 00:51:47.232
MARISHA: Six.
TRAVIS: (laughs)

00:51:47.232 --> 00:51:49.224
LAURA: I got Healing Word.

00:51:49.224 --> 00:51:51.163
TRAVIS: One of those is mine.
LIAM: 'Sup, Caleb.

00:51:51.163 --> 00:51:53.587
ASHLEY: You have six? You should have more.

00:51:53.587 --> 00:51:55.013
LAURA: No, she got sucked dry a little bit.

00:51:55.013 --> 00:51:57.681
ASHLEY: You got hit, you got-- never mind.

00:51:57.681 --> 00:52:00.406
LAURA: Maybe we should take a little rest or something?

00:52:00.406 --> 00:52:02.908
TALIESIN: Let's maybe find a place that isn't

00:52:02.908 --> 00:52:04.732
quite so ominous?
MARISHA: Caduceus.

00:52:04.732 --> 00:52:06.557
MATT: "I think that's a good idea."

00:52:06.557 --> 00:52:08.619
MARISHA: Do I have biceps still?

00:52:08.619 --> 00:52:10.864
Did I lose my biceps?

00:52:10.864 --> 00:52:13.084
TRAVIS: Viridian, do you know how much further this

00:52:13.084 --> 00:52:16.793
TALIESIN: I mean, they're there.
TRAVIS: -- particular cesspooly area

00:52:16.793 --> 00:52:19.116
goes on all the way to the mountain or--?

00:52:19.116 --> 00:52:23.541
MATT: "No, no, probably another, at most,

00:52:23.541 --> 00:52:24.947
"an hour's worth of travel."

00:52:24.947 --> 00:52:27.672
TRAVIS: Should we try and get out of the inky black stuff?

00:52:27.672 --> 00:52:29.923
MATT: "I would recommend that."

00:52:29.923 --> 00:52:31.496
TRAVIS: Can you make it another hour, Beau?

00:52:31.496 --> 00:52:34.203
Do you have a potion?
MARISHA: Yeah.

00:52:34.203 --> 00:52:36.343
I do, but I'm fine.

00:52:36.343 --> 00:52:39.164
LAURA: I'm going to use Healing Word just to be safe, okay?

00:52:39.164 --> 00:52:39.997
SAM: Yeah.
TALIESIN: I was going

00:52:39.997 --> 00:52:41.537
to throw a Cure Wounds at this, too.

00:52:41.537 --> 00:52:43.011
TRAVIS: I'll give you another one hit point.

00:52:43.011 --> 00:52:45.093
I mean, it's no big, just chill.

00:52:45.093 --> 00:52:46.833
LAURA: I'm going to Healing Word

00:52:46.833 --> 00:52:48.806
at 3rd-level for you, Beau.
MARISHA: Oh, it's like Icy Hot.

00:52:48.806 --> 00:52:49.639
Thank you.

00:52:49.639 --> 00:52:51.823
TALIESIN: Then I'm going to do a quick Cure Wounds

00:52:51.823 --> 00:52:53.794
at a 2nd-level.

00:52:53.794 --> 00:52:55.915
ASHLEY: I mean, I can only do
that once a day, anyways.

00:52:55.915 --> 00:52:57.076
TRAVIS: Oh, only once a day?

00:52:57.076 --> 00:52:58.166
Shame.
TALIESIN: Oh, that's not bad.

00:52:58.166 --> 00:53:00.151
ASHLEY: You know, it's not my thing.
TALIESIN: 13 points also.

00:53:00.151 --> 00:53:02.287
SAM: It was just much more powerful, Fjord.

00:53:02.287 --> 00:53:04.063
TRAVIS: Wow, okay.
MATT: 13,

00:53:04.063 --> 00:53:05.726
and you have a 3rd-level Healing Word, you said?

00:53:05.726 --> 00:53:07.409
SAM: And she's not even a magic user.
LAURA: Yes.

00:53:07.409 --> 00:53:09.117
TRAVIS: Some people care about quantity

00:53:09.117 --> 00:53:11.459
over quality, okay?
ASHLEY: That's just like instant 12 points.

00:53:11.459 --> 00:53:12.536
You know, I don't even have to--

00:53:12.536 --> 00:53:13.502
SAM: She doesn't blink

00:53:13.502 --> 00:53:15.561
or have to cast anything.
LAURA: 14 points.

00:53:15.561 --> 00:53:17.494
SAM: She just does it.
ASHLEY: It just happens for me.

00:53:17.494 --> 00:53:19.082
TALIESIN: Just until we find a place

00:53:19.082 --> 00:53:19.915
to take a short rest.
LIAM: They're not doctors,

00:53:19.915 --> 00:53:21.617
they're EMTs.

00:53:21.617 --> 00:53:23.089
They'll get you up real quick, that's it.

00:53:23.089 --> 00:53:25.409
TRAVIS: We're lifeguards.
LIAM: Yeah, yep.

00:53:25.409 --> 00:53:26.992
MATT: How much is that?

00:53:28.684 --> 00:53:29.517
Five?

00:53:29.517 --> 00:53:31.364
LAURA: 14.
MATT: Oh, 14. (laughs)

00:53:31.364 --> 00:53:34.823
TRAVIS: What is this? How is that--

00:53:34.823 --> 00:53:36.603
LAURA: Well, I held up four for 14

00:53:36.603 --> 00:53:38.070
and then I realized.
MATT: Four and then teen.

00:53:38.070 --> 00:53:39.012
(laughter)

00:53:39.012 --> 00:53:40.911
Come on, Travis. Get with it.

00:53:40.911 --> 00:53:42.702
LIAM: (like Jester) You know.
TRAVIS: Oh no.

00:53:42.702 --> 00:53:44.244
LAURA: I had Oreo in my mouth, okay?

00:53:44.244 --> 00:53:45.761
TRAVIS: Are we teaching Ronin 14?

00:53:45.761 --> 00:53:47.464
(laughter)

00:53:47.464 --> 00:53:49.339
LIAM: (like Jester) You know, 72.

00:53:50.882 --> 00:53:53.465
TALIESIN: He has 55 fingers, to be fair.

00:53:55.030 --> 00:53:57.819
LIAM: Viridian, how far are we from

00:53:57.819 --> 00:54:02.625
that thing's normal haunting grounds in time?

00:54:02.625 --> 00:54:04.146
MATT: "Two day's travel, at least,

00:54:04.146 --> 00:54:06.210
"on the northern side of the island."

00:54:06.210 --> 00:54:09.237
LAURA: Does he move fast or is he, like, super slow?

00:54:09.237 --> 00:54:10.383
That must've taken him a while.

00:54:10.383 --> 00:54:12.698
MATT: "I mean, I can't tell.

00:54:12.698 --> 00:54:14.351
"I've not encountered it myself."

00:54:14.351 --> 00:54:16.103
ASHLEY: Why do you think he was down here?

00:54:16.103 --> 00:54:17.907
You don't usually see him around?

00:54:17.907 --> 00:54:19.561
MATT: "No, I've not seen him in my travels,

00:54:19.561 --> 00:54:22.277
"but I normally don't veer from the path to and from

00:54:22.277 --> 00:54:23.900
"the mountain space, itself."

00:54:23.900 --> 00:54:26.365
MARISHA: Are you sure this is the same one?

00:54:26.365 --> 00:54:27.327
MATT: "I hope so.

00:54:27.327 --> 00:54:32.324
"I would hate to think there's more of these on the island.

00:54:32.324 --> 00:54:35.571
"Nevertheless, I think it's best we move on from this space

00:54:35.571 --> 00:54:37.186
"in case we draw any more of the wisps

00:54:37.186 --> 00:54:38.294
"from the swamp around us."

00:54:38.294 --> 00:54:39.765
TRAVIS: Agreed.

00:54:39.765 --> 00:54:44.455
MATT: "Follow me," and you watch as Viridian takes the lead

00:54:44.455 --> 00:54:46.106
on this one.

00:54:46.106 --> 00:54:49.474
What's the marching order going forward following Viridian?

00:54:49.474 --> 00:54:51.207
LIAM: Caleb takes the center.

00:54:51.207 --> 00:54:52.771
SAM: Let's put Beau in the middle, too.

00:54:52.771 --> 00:54:53.823
She's a little bit--

00:54:53.823 --> 00:54:54.737
TALIESIN: I'll go in the front.

00:54:54.737 --> 00:54:55.570
MARISHA: Yasha.

00:54:55.570 --> 00:54:57.287
ASHLEY: I'll-- Yeah.
LAURA: I'm going to,

00:54:57.287 --> 00:54:59.733
just for as long as my Spiritual Weapon stays up,

00:54:59.733 --> 00:55:03.067
which isn't much longer, I'm going to just try to eat it.

00:55:03.067 --> 00:55:05.867
MATT: Okay, sure.

00:55:05.867 --> 00:55:08.123
TALIESIN: It's more of a lickable object.
MATT: It's your Spiritual Weapon,

00:55:08.123 --> 00:55:09.402
so you describe what happens as you try

00:55:09.402 --> 00:55:11.451
and lick your bladed lollipop.

00:55:11.451 --> 00:55:13.488
LAURA: Well, I'm not licking the blades.

00:55:13.488 --> 00:55:14.951
I'm licking the middle.

00:55:14.951 --> 00:55:17.878
MATT: Okay, and it tastes like?

00:55:17.878 --> 00:55:20.685
LAURA: Strawberries and cotton candy.

00:55:20.685 --> 00:55:21.518
MATT: Checks out.

00:55:21.518 --> 00:55:23.545
TALIESIN: I've always imagined that
the blades were retractable

00:55:23.545 --> 00:55:25.286
like the phantasmagoria ball.

00:55:25.286 --> 00:55:26.635
LAURA: Yeah, I just don't want to risk it.

00:55:26.635 --> 00:55:28.729
Just in case something triggers it,

00:55:28.729 --> 00:55:31.194
like, a touch or something makes them come out.

00:55:31.194 --> 00:55:35.603
LIAM: Just shards of hard candy. (ticks)

00:55:35.603 --> 00:55:38.320
ASHLEY: Beau, do you need a hand?

00:55:39.250 --> 00:55:42.470
MARISHA: It's been a while since
I've asked for this favor, but

00:55:42.470 --> 00:55:44.128
TRAVIS and LIAM: ♪ It's been a while. ♪

00:55:44.978 --> 00:55:48.078
ASHLEY: Yeah, I can--
MARISHA: Will you hold me and carry me?

00:55:48.078 --> 00:55:49.161
ASHLEY: I can hold you.

00:55:49.161 --> 00:55:51.274
MARISHA: Okay, thank you.

LAURA: (cackles)

00:55:53.321 --> 00:55:54.525
ASHLEY: Take a load off.

00:55:54.525 --> 00:55:56.515
MARISHA: Okay, this is nice, thank you.

00:55:56.515 --> 00:55:57.421
ASHLEY: Yeah, you got it.

00:55:57.421 --> 00:55:58.678
TRAVIS: Are you doing the fireman's carry

00:55:58.678 --> 00:56:00.512
or over the shoulder like a sack of potatoes?

00:56:00.512 --> 00:56:02.945
MATT: Like a koala?
MARISHA: Fireman's, this my arm

00:56:02.945 --> 00:56:03.797
over her neck.

00:56:03.797 --> 00:56:04.630
ASHLEY: Arms around her.
LAURA: Patting

00:56:04.630 --> 00:56:07.739
your little butt.
ASHLEY: Her legs around me.

00:56:07.739 --> 00:56:10.270
There you go.

00:56:10.270 --> 00:56:11.871
TRAVIS: There's a good burp.

00:56:11.871 --> 00:56:14.249
MATT: So Viridian's at the front,

00:56:14.249 --> 00:56:18.496
and then we have Caleb.
Beau is now being held by Yasha.

00:56:18.496 --> 00:56:20.566
LAURA: I'll follow behind them because I want to draw this

00:56:20.566 --> 00:56:21.720
in my sketchbook.

00:56:21.720 --> 00:56:23.388
TALIESIN: I'll be right in the front, actually.

00:56:23.388 --> 00:56:25.477
MATT: Right in the front, behind Viridian?

00:56:25.477 --> 00:56:28.015
TALIESIN: Behind Viridian.
MATT: All right, and then Fjord and--

00:56:28.015 --> 00:56:29.724
TALIESIN: High perception, and that way,

00:56:29.724 --> 00:56:32.134
people can pull me out of the water If I fall in again.

00:56:32.134 --> 00:56:35.628
MATT: Fjord and Veth, where are you guys at?

00:56:35.628 --> 00:56:36.860
SAM: Back.
TRAVIS: Yep.

00:56:36.860 --> 00:56:38.498
MATT: All right, you guys have got the rear.

00:56:38.498 --> 00:56:41.537
LAURA: As I follow behind Beau and Yasha,

00:56:41.537 --> 00:56:45.458
when Beau looks back at me, I'm going to be like--

00:56:45.458 --> 00:56:47.682
(laughter)

00:56:47.682 --> 00:56:49.474
LAURA: (mouthed) I mean, her big muscles!
MARISHA: (mouthed) So warm

00:56:49.474 --> 00:56:52.232
and strong and comfortable!

00:56:52.232 --> 00:56:54.957
MATT: Roll a perception check, Yasha.

00:56:54.957 --> 00:56:57.290
ASHLEY: I was just going to say that.

00:56:58.802 --> 00:57:00.702
I can feel her arms moving around.

00:57:00.702 --> 00:57:01.992
MATT: Yeah, gestating.

00:57:01.992 --> 00:57:04.075
TRAVIS: She's having a seizure.

00:57:05.343 --> 00:57:06.684
ASHLEY: Okay.

00:57:07.776 --> 00:57:08.627
15.

00:57:08.627 --> 00:57:10.210
MATT: 15.

00:57:10.210 --> 00:57:11.368
Make a sleight of hand check.

00:57:11.368 --> 00:57:13.599
MARISHA: Okay!
(laughter)

00:57:14.741 --> 00:57:16.604
I don't know-- I don't do this very often.

00:57:16.604 --> 00:57:18.036
TRAVIS: Fail.
LIAM: ♪ Fail. ♪

00:57:18.036 --> 00:57:19.944
MARISHA: I'm using my good-- oh.

00:57:19.944 --> 00:57:20.777
24.

00:57:20.777 --> 00:57:21.740
LAURA: Ooh!

00:57:21.740 --> 00:57:24.076

TRAVIS: Wow.

00:57:25.561 --> 00:57:28.274
MARISHA: (whispers) She smells good. (sniffs)

00:57:28.274 --> 00:57:29.739
LAURA: I lean forward and I'm trying to smell her

00:57:29.739 --> 00:57:30.921
as we're walking.

00:57:30.921 --> 00:57:33.162
(laughter)

MATT: With Viridian helping lead the way,

00:57:35.551 --> 00:57:36.898
there are a few points in time

00:57:36.898 --> 00:57:39.309
where some of the larger pits seemed to be a point

00:57:39.309 --> 00:57:40.755
of stopping and moving around.

00:57:40.755 --> 00:57:43.159
You watch as she carries her staff out in front

00:57:43.159 --> 00:57:47.095
and some of the nearby trees and roots shift

00:57:47.095 --> 00:57:48.846
to create a makeshift bridge temporarily

00:57:48.846 --> 00:57:50.403
and helps you continue forward.

00:57:50.403 --> 00:57:53.915
There is one more length of this to traverse.

00:57:53.915 --> 00:57:56.030
I will need everyone to make one more dexterity saving throw

00:57:56.030 --> 00:57:58.137
to avoid the darkened pits.

00:57:58.137 --> 00:58:00.664
TALIESIN: I'm going to cast Resistance on myself

00:58:00.664 --> 00:58:02.708
beforehand because I've been burned before.

00:58:02.708 --> 00:58:03.602
MATT: You got it.

00:58:03.602 --> 00:58:06.002
TRAVIS: Did the-- the saves don't--

00:58:06.002 --> 00:58:07.662
It's not a save.

00:58:07.662 --> 00:58:09.158
SAM: Wait, it's a save or a check?

00:58:09.158 --> 00:58:10.708
MATT: It's saving throw.

00:58:10.708 --> 00:58:11.836
TALIESIN: It's strength?

00:58:11.836 --> 00:58:13.840
MATT: Dexterity.
LAURA: Uh oh.

00:58:13.840 --> 00:58:16.522
TRAVIS: 14.
MATT: 14, okay. Jester?

00:58:16.522 --> 00:58:17.943
SAM: Fjordteen.
LAURA: Nine.

00:58:17.943 --> 00:58:18.809
MATT: All right.

00:58:18.809 --> 00:58:19.922
LIAM: 16.
MATT: All right.

00:58:19.922 --> 00:58:21.022
SAM: 25.

00:58:21.022 --> 00:58:22.898
ASHLEY: 17.
TALIESIN: 21!

00:58:22.898 --> 00:58:25.194
MARISHA: 17.
MATT: All righty.

00:58:25.194 --> 00:58:26.931
All of you manage to come across

00:58:26.931 --> 00:58:28.479
mostly without issue.
ASHLEY: Oh, we got the same number.

00:58:28.479 --> 00:58:30.109
MARISHA: We did!

00:58:30.109 --> 00:58:31.860
MATT: Makes sense.

00:58:31.860 --> 00:58:32.693
ASHLEY: Yeah.

00:58:32.693 --> 00:58:35.063
MATT: Jester, unfortunately,
MARISHA: I'm just dodging branches.

00:58:35.063 --> 00:58:38.104
MATT: In the process of watching and making hand motions

00:58:38.104 --> 00:58:40.140
and drawing this experience,

00:58:40.140 --> 00:58:41.510
you get about three or four steps

00:58:41.510 --> 00:58:44.877
before you realize there's a heavy sloshing sound (slurps),

00:58:44.877 --> 00:58:46.837
and you're about knee deep in the water.

00:58:46.837 --> 00:58:48.836
I need you to roll a d4, a d6 for me, sorry.

00:58:48.836 --> 00:58:49.669
LAURA: A d6.

00:58:49.669 --> 00:58:51.127
MATT: Yes.
SAM: Oh boy.

00:58:52.408 --> 00:58:54.363
LAURA: One?

00:58:54.363 --> 00:58:56.613
MATT: Okay.
TRAVIS: That's never good.

00:58:58.926 --> 00:59:03.518
MATT: Let me see if I can recall where the previous one was.

00:59:03.518 --> 00:59:08.512
As you begin to step into the middle of the space here

00:59:08.512 --> 00:59:11.931
and realize the danger that you're possibly in,

00:59:11.931 --> 00:59:15.681
you withdraw your legs from it without issue.

00:59:17.093 --> 00:59:18.162
SAM: So lucky.

00:59:18.162 --> 00:59:20.475
LAURA: Cool.
TRAVIS: A one did that?

00:59:20.475 --> 00:59:21.829
SAM: Ones are always good.
MARISHA: A d6.

00:59:21.829 --> 00:59:22.887
LAURA: Is that it, is that it?
LIAM: It's not a d20,

00:59:22.887 --> 00:59:25.217
it's a whole different system.
TRAVIS: Did you just walk in that thing?

00:59:25.217 --> 00:59:27.319
LAURA: Yeah, but I'm going to stare at it for a minute.

00:59:27.319 --> 00:59:31.188
MATT: Okay, you watch as elements
of the murky tar-like liquid

00:59:31.188 --> 00:59:34.469
beneath it has darkened the lower half of your body,

00:59:34.469 --> 00:59:38.785
(blurbs) and then just sits there,

00:59:38.785 --> 00:59:42.609
clusters of dying vegetation floating on top.
TRAVIS: You have to be careful.

00:59:42.609 --> 00:59:44.987
LAURA: Hey, man, it didn't even do anything.

00:59:44.987 --> 00:59:47.077
Caduceus, why are you always having so much trouble

00:59:47.077 --> 00:59:47.910
with this stuff?

00:59:47.910 --> 00:59:50.411
It's easy, just step right back out of it.

00:59:50.411 --> 00:59:52.661
(laughter)

00:59:54.881 --> 00:59:59.137
(laughter)

00:59:59.137 --> 01:00:00.386
TALIESIN: I feel like I tried that.

01:00:00.386 --> 01:00:02.520
I don't know why it didn't work.

01:00:02.520 --> 01:00:04.877
I mean, I feel like I've tried that.

01:00:04.877 --> 01:00:06.510
LAURA: It happens again, just remember--

01:00:06.510 --> 01:00:08.541
TALIESIN: Yeah, maybe I didn't.
LAURA: Just walk right out.

01:00:08.541 --> 01:00:11.427
TALIESIN: It's been very distracting here, to be fair.

01:00:11.427 --> 01:00:12.260
All right.

01:00:12.260 --> 01:00:14.257
ASHLEY: If it happens again, I can always pull you out.

01:00:14.257 --> 01:00:16.338
(laughter)

01:00:16.338 --> 01:00:19.013
TALIESIN: I can't.
SAM: Oh, Yasha, Yasha.

01:00:19.013 --> 01:00:20.861
I think she's asleep.

01:00:20.861 --> 01:00:22.086
ASHLEY: (shushes)

01:00:22.086 --> 01:00:25.786
(laughter)

01:00:27.944 --> 01:00:31.977
SAM: (raspberries and cries)

01:00:31.977 --> 01:00:36.647
ASHLEY: No, I want the art to look cool if they can draw it.

01:00:36.647 --> 01:00:38.672
TALIESIN: (shushes) She's dreaming.

01:00:38.672 --> 01:00:39.886
ASHLEY: Don't draw it that way.

01:00:39.886 --> 01:00:41.977
MATT: Speaking of dreams, though.
TALIESIN: Oh no.

01:00:41.977 --> 01:00:43.585
MATT: As you guys begin to move on

01:00:43.585 --> 01:00:46.485
and find that these

01:00:46.485 --> 01:00:50.188
thick, clustered, dark tar pits

01:00:50.188 --> 01:00:53.105
begin to slowly drain away.

01:00:53.105 --> 01:00:56.537
The swamp, at least, changes and transitions

01:00:56.537 --> 01:00:59.245
from this dark, cold space,

01:00:59.245 --> 01:01:02.992
color seems to return to the surrounding vegetation.

01:01:02.992 --> 01:01:05.892
The temperature begins to rise

01:01:05.892 --> 01:01:09.081
to an uncomfortable tropical temperature.

01:01:09.081 --> 01:01:10.777
The heavy armor of which many of you wear

01:01:10.777 --> 01:01:13.021
and the layers of which you brought here

01:01:13.021 --> 01:01:16.387
based on your Xhorhasian experiences

01:01:16.387 --> 01:01:18.156
and the colder temperature of what you just passed through,

01:01:18.156 --> 01:01:20.416
cause you to begin to sweat beneath your armor.

01:01:20.416 --> 01:01:24.477
You begin to hear the buzz of insects swarming

01:01:24.477 --> 01:01:28.443
and keeping a vicinity to the new sweaty individuals

01:01:28.443 --> 01:01:31.549
that are traversing this.

01:01:31.549 --> 01:01:34.233
Going forward for the next 30 minutes

01:01:34.233 --> 01:01:37.447
or so through this space, the--

01:01:37.447 --> 01:01:41.572
the jungle is back to its fully lush and dense sense

01:01:41.572 --> 01:01:44.429
that it was when you first arrived on the island,

01:01:44.429 --> 01:01:46.077
but these insects are bugging you.

01:01:46.077 --> 01:01:48.864
You begin to feel a pain and slap as it goes.

01:01:48.864 --> 01:01:50.037
LAURA: Can you talk to them?

01:01:50.037 --> 01:01:51.962
TALIESIN: I mean, yeah.

01:01:51.962 --> 01:01:53.920
Hey, do you all mind for a little bit?

01:01:53.920 --> 01:01:56.317
I'm sure there's other things to eat and, honestly,

01:01:56.317 --> 01:01:58.143
we're probably bad for you.

01:01:58.143 --> 01:01:59.275
MATT: (buzzing)
TALIESIN: We're from way far away.

01:01:59.275 --> 01:02:00.276
I mean, like--
MATT: (clicks) Right there

01:02:00.276 --> 01:02:02.009
on the forehead.
LAURA: Oh!

01:02:04.792 --> 01:02:07.677
TALIESIN: All right, apparently,
we have to agree to disagree.

01:02:07.677 --> 01:02:12.677
LAURA: Can't you just suck them
into your staff for something?

01:02:13.094 --> 01:02:15.812
TALIESIN: I'm just going to see if
I can rattle some of my insects

01:02:15.812 --> 01:02:18.002
out of the staff to see if they'll come up

01:02:18.002 --> 01:02:20.328
and maybe help out a little bit.
SAM: Vouch for you?

01:02:20.328 --> 01:02:21.282
TALIESIN: They're carnivorous.

01:02:21.282 --> 01:02:24.447
MATT: They come out and hang out
on the very, very top portion

01:02:24.447 --> 01:02:27.443
of the staff and clutching onto the wood.

01:02:27.443 --> 01:02:30.502
Not a whole lot of interaction between your beetles

01:02:30.502 --> 01:02:33.358
and these large, mosquito-like insects

01:02:33.358 --> 01:02:38.010
that seem to be keeping a very, very close distance

01:02:38.010 --> 01:02:39.177
to your party.

01:02:40.814 --> 01:02:43.576
Uncomfortable as it is, after a while of passing

01:02:43.576 --> 01:02:46.424
through these clouds and trying to slap them as they come,

01:02:46.424 --> 01:02:48.320
I do need everyone to make a constitution saving throw

01:02:48.320 --> 01:02:50.124
for me, please.
(groaning)

01:02:50.124 --> 01:02:53.032
LIAM: Could I Produce Flame in my hand and using that

01:02:53.032 --> 01:02:55.176
as sort of like a bug spray.
TRAVIS: Fucking West Nile.

01:02:55.176 --> 01:02:56.868
MATT: Yeah.
LIAM: For this.

01:02:56.868 --> 01:02:58.748
MATT: I'll say with that, it'll give you advantage

01:02:58.748 --> 01:03:01.052
on your saving throw.

01:03:01.052 --> 01:03:02.822
TRAVIS: Same thing, 14.

01:03:02.822 --> 01:03:05.531
Wait, was that dexterity or constitution?
MATT: Constitution.

01:03:05.531 --> 01:03:09.042
TRAVIS: 18.
MATT: 18. Jester?

01:03:09.042 --> 01:03:10.470
LAURA: Six.
MATT: Okay.

01:03:10.470 --> 01:03:12.440
ASHLEY: Oh no.

01:03:12.440 --> 01:03:13.932
SAM: Caleb.
LIAM: 26.

01:03:13.932 --> 01:03:15.719
MATT: All right.
SAM: 16.

01:03:15.719 --> 01:03:17.031
MATT: Yasha?
ASHLEY: 26.

01:03:17.031 --> 01:03:18.454
MATT: All right.
TALIESIN: 17.

01:03:18.454 --> 01:03:19.764
MATT: All right.
MARISHA: 15?

01:03:19.764 --> 01:03:21.249
MATT: All right.

01:03:21.249 --> 01:03:22.762
LAURA: I'm really sweet, you guys.

01:03:22.762 --> 01:03:25.004
(laughter)

01:03:26.459 --> 01:03:28.601
MATT: Okay.

01:03:28.601 --> 01:03:32.009
You begin to look up past the various breaks

01:03:32.009 --> 01:03:33.299
in the jungle canopy,

01:03:33.299 --> 01:03:36.987
and you can see the mountain is looming larger and larger

01:03:36.987 --> 01:03:40.439
still as the day gets closer and closer to sunset.

01:03:40.439 --> 01:03:43.167
You can see the colors shifting in the sky,

01:03:43.167 --> 01:03:45.784
and looking up at the mountain,

01:03:45.784 --> 01:03:49.115
the mist that hangs and suffuses the surrounding jungle

01:03:49.115 --> 01:03:53.993
gives it this very hazy, this very dream-like quality to it.

01:03:53.993 --> 01:03:57.611
You get momentarily lost in the spectacle of the space

01:03:57.611 --> 01:04:00.007
around you and shake yourself out of it

01:04:00.007 --> 01:04:01.251
and still can't shake that feeling

01:04:01.251 --> 01:04:02.585
like you're being watched.

01:04:02.585 --> 01:04:05.112
SAM: Oh, that's right.

01:04:05.112 --> 01:04:08.049
MATT: Jester, you're not feeling so well.

01:04:08.049 --> 01:04:09.248
LAURA: Like, how not well?

01:04:09.248 --> 01:04:13.238
MATT: Like, you start to sweat profusely.

01:04:13.238 --> 01:04:15.526
Your knees are starting to ache a little bit.

01:04:15.526 --> 01:04:17.587
Your stomach's started to knot and twist.

01:04:17.587 --> 01:04:19.060
MARISHA: No.

01:04:19.060 --> 01:04:21.127
MATT: As Viridian goes, "(sighs)

01:04:21.127 --> 01:04:22.991
"We should be getting there very soon.

01:04:22.991 --> 01:04:24.767
"We passed the hard elements of it.

01:04:24.767 --> 01:04:26.513
"You said you need to rest?"

01:04:26.513 --> 01:04:28.475
SAM: Oh, yes, that's right.
We're going to take a short rest.

01:04:28.475 --> 01:04:29.825
TALIESIN: Short rest might be a good idea,

01:04:29.825 --> 01:04:31.513
especially if there is a way that we can get some--

01:04:31.513 --> 01:04:33.655
Are the insects, have they let off a bit?

01:04:33.655 --> 01:04:35.021
MATT: "Insects?"

01:04:37.764 --> 01:04:38.943
Are you asking Viridian?

01:04:38.943 --> 01:04:41.054
TALIESIN: No, have the insects let off a bit?

01:04:41.054 --> 01:04:43.419
MATT: They let off a little bit, but for the most part,

01:04:43.419 --> 01:04:45.929
you guys are just pushing them off as they come

01:04:45.929 --> 01:04:47.057
and smacking them as they go.

01:04:47.057 --> 01:04:49.448
It's not the worst it's been, but they're still around.

01:04:49.448 --> 01:04:52.588
TRAVIS: Is Viridian not bothered by the insects?

01:04:52.588 --> 01:04:54.424
MATT: She doesn't seem to be.

01:04:54.424 --> 01:04:57.876
ASHLEY: Do you get bit by these a lot?

01:04:57.876 --> 01:05:00.361
MATT: "They do, but it doesn't seem to bother me much.

01:05:00.361 --> 01:05:03.850
"I usually, once again, don't traverse

01:05:03.850 --> 01:05:07.346
"quite as physically through this space."

01:05:07.346 --> 01:05:09.004
LIAM: Are you feeling all right?

01:05:09.004 --> 01:05:10.842
LAURA: Um.

01:05:10.842 --> 01:05:15.175
LIAM: You look a little peaked, different shade of blue.

01:05:15.175 --> 01:05:18.804
LAURA: I feel kind of shitty.

01:05:18.804 --> 01:05:20.887
MARISHA: Well, how much longer until we rest?

01:05:20.887 --> 01:05:23.331
SAM: Do you need to go out in the woods and make a poo poo?

01:05:23.331 --> 01:05:25.718
LAURA: I can't tell for sure. I'm not sure.

01:05:25.718 --> 01:05:27.505
TALIESIN: Oh, that's the worst.

01:05:27.505 --> 01:05:29.612
LAURA: It might come out top, it might come out bottom.

01:05:29.612 --> 01:05:31.093
MARISHA: Ooh, I hate that.

01:05:31.093 --> 01:05:32.758
ASHLEY: Oh, like you feel it in your stomach?

01:05:32.758 --> 01:05:33.817
TRAVIS: Yeah, the twirls.

01:05:33.817 --> 01:05:37.258
LIAM: Caduceus, is there anything that you can do for her?

01:05:37.258 --> 01:05:38.214
Tea or--

01:05:38.214 --> 01:05:41.920
TALIESIN: I mean, I can try a couple things.

01:05:41.920 --> 01:05:44.412
LAURA: My skin feels achy.

01:05:46.809 --> 01:05:48.975
SAM: Achy skin?

01:05:48.975 --> 01:05:50.801
LAURA: Yeah.
SAM: Well, that's no good.

01:05:50.801 --> 01:05:53.077
TRAVIS: You know, I could try to--

01:05:53.077 --> 01:05:54.560
LAURA: I'm going to sit down.

01:05:54.560 --> 01:05:57.862
TRAVIS: I'm going to use five hit points
from my Land on Hands,

01:05:57.862 --> 01:06:01.060
and I'll touch Jester's shoulder and try and cure a disease

01:06:01.060 --> 01:06:02.430
or neutralize a poison.

01:06:02.430 --> 01:06:04.635
LAURA: Touch my head. Do I feel hot, Fjord?

01:06:04.635 --> 01:06:06.545
Is my head--
TRAVIS: Does she feel hot?

01:06:06.545 --> 01:06:07.630
MATT: She does feel quite hot, yeah.

01:06:07.630 --> 01:06:10.231
TRAVIS: Oh, yeah.
LAURA: Do I feel shivery?

01:06:10.231 --> 01:06:12.885
TRAVIS: Take some refuge with the Wild Mother. (blurbs)

01:06:12.885 --> 01:06:15.442
MATT: Okay, you feel this warm sensation emerge

01:06:15.442 --> 01:06:17.468
from Fjord's palm, and as it does,

01:06:17.468 --> 01:06:19.270
it resonates through your forehead

01:06:19.270 --> 01:06:21.574
and down into the neck where the

01:06:21.574 --> 01:06:24.464
lymph nodes felt a little swollen,

01:06:24.464 --> 01:06:27.202
and with that warmth, the discomfort fades.

01:06:27.202 --> 01:06:29.842
The disease that had just set within you

01:06:29.842 --> 01:06:32.005
is purged from the body.

01:06:32.005 --> 01:06:34.455
MARISHA: Hell yeah.
LAURA: Hey!

01:06:34.455 --> 01:06:36.372
I certainly don't have to poop anymore.

01:06:36.372 --> 01:06:37.608
TRAVIS: Oh, really?
LAURA: Yeah.

01:06:37.608 --> 01:06:38.874
TRAVIS: That's wonderful.

01:06:38.874 --> 01:06:40.468
Does that mean you went?

01:06:40.468 --> 01:06:42.794
LAURA: I don't know. No!

01:06:42.794 --> 01:06:44.419
TRAVIS: No poops?
LAURA: It just went away.

01:06:44.419 --> 01:06:45.719
TRAVIS: Okay, well, that's good.

01:06:45.719 --> 01:06:48.330
SAM: Wow.
LAURA: Wow, thanks, Fjord.

01:06:48.330 --> 01:06:49.956
TRAVIS: Yeah, no problem.

01:06:49.956 --> 01:06:52.274
MATT: At this point, Viridian has begun

01:06:52.274 --> 01:06:55.543
to gather elements of the nearby heavy roots

01:06:55.543 --> 01:06:59.494
and built this small enclosure, if you will,

01:06:59.494 --> 01:07:04.030
this temporary enclosure of knotted bark and wood.

01:07:04.030 --> 01:07:06.636
MARISHA: Holy shit, you did that really fast.

01:07:06.636 --> 01:07:07.925
MATT: "It's my specialty."

01:07:07.925 --> 01:07:09.601
MARISHA: Yeah, that's cool.

01:07:09.601 --> 01:07:11.890
MATT: "Come, let's take a rest," and she goes over

01:07:11.890 --> 01:07:13.725
and sits down, takes the staff and sets it in the ground

01:07:13.725 --> 01:07:17.626
and begins to meditate, the twisted vines

01:07:17.626 --> 01:07:22.626
that form the right leg temporarily rooting into the ground.

01:07:22.896 --> 01:07:24.823
ASHLEY: I put Beau down.

01:07:24.823 --> 01:07:26.283
You feeling okay?

01:07:26.283 --> 01:07:29.918
MARISHA: Yeah, no, you're great.

01:07:29.918 --> 01:07:31.448
Thank you.

01:07:31.448 --> 01:07:35.985
I'm going to meditate, too, and just try and (snores)

01:07:35.985 --> 01:07:38.360
and take a power nap and recover some hit points.

01:07:38.360 --> 01:07:39.443
MATT: Okay, are you guys taking a short rest?

01:07:39.443 --> 01:07:40.276
LAURA: Yeah.
TRAVIS: Yes, please.

01:07:40.276 --> 01:07:42.826
MATT: All righty, you get your spells back.

01:07:42.826 --> 01:07:44.432
You get your Channel Divinities back.

01:07:44.432 --> 01:07:45.775
Any other short rest abilities come back

01:07:45.775 --> 01:07:48.402
and you can spend any hit dice if you have them.

01:07:48.402 --> 01:07:49.522
TRAVIS: During the short rest,

01:07:49.522 --> 01:07:53.919
can I go over to Jester,

01:07:53.919 --> 01:07:56.185
and as quietly as I can,

01:07:56.185 --> 01:07:59.760
possibly out of earshot of Viridian,

01:07:59.760 --> 01:08:00.893
and just say:

01:08:00.893 --> 01:08:05.308
Jester, I feel like when those mosquitoes

01:08:05.308 --> 01:08:07.808
were buzzing that maybe they might have transferred

01:08:07.808 --> 01:08:10.248
some sort of, I don't know, poison or disease,

01:08:10.248 --> 01:08:13.618
and what the Wild Mother has enabled me

01:08:13.618 --> 01:08:15.178
to do is neutralize that.

01:08:15.178 --> 01:08:17.678
Do you have something similar?

01:08:19.357 --> 01:08:21.679
LAURA: Like being able to get rid of disease?

01:08:21.679 --> 01:08:22.771
TRAVIS: Yeah, I just wondered.

01:08:22.771 --> 01:08:24.803
Viridian said she didn't really--

01:08:24.803 --> 01:08:26.043
LAURA: Feel anything about it?

01:08:26.043 --> 01:08:26.945
TRAVIS: Yeah.

01:08:26.945 --> 01:08:29.270
LAURA: I mean, I always have been--

01:08:30.236 --> 01:08:32.997
mosquitoes are always attracted to me.

01:08:32.997 --> 01:08:33.830
TRAVIS: Always?

01:08:33.830 --> 01:08:35.303
LAURA: I've always had that problem.

01:08:35.303 --> 01:08:37.986
My mama says it's because I eat so much candy.

01:08:37.986 --> 01:08:39.226
TRAVIS: That would make sense.

01:08:39.226 --> 01:08:42.160
LAURA: But I don't know.

01:08:42.160 --> 01:08:45.518
I do have stuff that can help with that,

01:08:45.518 --> 01:08:47.754
but not right now.

01:08:47.754 --> 01:08:49.455
TRAVIS: Okay, I also have it.

01:08:49.455 --> 01:08:50.642
I just--

01:08:50.642 --> 01:08:52.763
LAURA: I bet Caduceus has something like it though.

01:08:52.763 --> 01:08:54.207
He's usually a bit more prepared

01:08:54.207 --> 01:08:56.503
in the ways of healing than me.

01:08:56.503 --> 01:08:58.738
Sometimes I forget to remember

01:08:58.738 --> 01:09:00.280
that I'm supposed to heal people.

01:09:00.280 --> 01:09:02.231
TRAVIS: Right, I also don't want to offend her,

01:09:02.231 --> 01:09:04.739
but it can't hurt to just try

01:09:04.739 --> 01:09:06.966
and neutralize something that may or may not be there.

01:09:06.966 --> 01:09:08.274
I'll ask him.

01:09:08.274 --> 01:09:10.701
LAURA: Oh, you mean you think she's diseased?

01:09:10.701 --> 01:09:12.826
TRAVIS: Isn't it strange that everyone--

01:09:12.826 --> 01:09:14.978
(whispering) Isn't it strange that everyone here seems

01:09:14.978 --> 01:09:17.869
to forget where they are and where they came from?
LAURA: Well, yeah.

01:09:17.869 --> 01:09:19.599
TRAVIS: Wouldn't it make sense that maybe it's something

01:09:19.599 --> 01:09:20.826
on the island that's doing it?

01:09:20.826 --> 01:09:24.388
What if it's just the wildlife or the mosquitoes or,

01:09:24.388 --> 01:09:26.298
I don't know, what if they're all just needing

01:09:26.298 --> 01:09:27.576
to be purged of it?

01:09:27.576 --> 01:09:29.436
LAURA: Wait, so, you can literally just walk up to her

01:09:29.436 --> 01:09:33.033
and touch her and then maybe she'll be cured?

01:09:33.033 --> 01:09:33.866
TRAVIS: Yeah.

01:09:33.866 --> 01:09:37.209
LAURA: Should we ask if she wants a massage or something?

01:09:37.209 --> 01:09:38.489
TRAVIS: That feels a little overt.

01:09:38.489 --> 01:09:40.998
I was just thinking maybe like a "uh-oh!"

01:09:40.998 --> 01:09:43.340
and trip and "oh, you caught me."
LAURA: Accidentally grab her boob.

01:09:43.340 --> 01:09:45.084
TRAVIS: No, shoulder or elbow.

01:09:45.084 --> 01:09:45.917
Why boob?

01:09:45.917 --> 01:09:46.750
LAURA: I don't know.

01:09:46.750 --> 01:09:48.355
It's just that's what it seemed like you were doing.

01:09:48.355 --> 01:09:50.602
TRAVIS: No, that would be-- I was up here.

01:09:50.602 --> 01:09:51.435
LAURA: Oh, okay.

01:09:51.435 --> 01:09:52.887
I mean, that's better, probably.

01:09:52.887 --> 01:09:54.490
TRAVIS: How tall is Viridian?

01:09:54.490 --> 01:09:56.362
MATT: I'd say about 5'8".

01:09:56.362 --> 01:09:57.226
TRAVIS: Yeah, it's the shoulder.

01:09:57.226 --> 01:09:59.142
LAURA: Yeah, okay, okay, okay.

01:10:00.339 --> 01:10:01.949
Can I ask you a question?

01:10:01.949 --> 01:10:03.080
TRAVIS: Yes.

01:10:03.080 --> 01:10:05.720
LAURA: Do you think it's weird
that Viridian, who's not a god,

01:10:05.720 --> 01:10:09.608
can basically do the same things that the Traveler can do?

01:10:09.608 --> 01:10:12.170
What if the Traveler's just a druid?

01:10:12.170 --> 01:10:13.387
TRAVIS: Viridian?

01:10:14.581 --> 01:10:17.941
LAURA: She's shaping the wildlife and that's something

01:10:17.941 --> 01:10:18.853
that the Traveler can do.

01:10:18.853 --> 01:10:20.472
What if she can make herself really big?

01:10:20.472 --> 01:10:22.777
I mean, she did turn herself into an owl.

01:10:22.777 --> 01:10:24.946
TRAVIS: Right, but didn't you also say the Traveler's

01:10:24.946 --> 01:10:26.397
not a god either?

01:10:26.397 --> 01:10:28.198
LAURA: Well, no, I know.

01:10:28.198 --> 01:10:30.410
Right. He's not.

01:10:30.410 --> 01:10:32.312
TRAVIS: Right. Is that a problem?

01:10:32.312 --> 01:10:33.898
LAURA: But he's still supposed to be super powerful

01:10:33.898 --> 01:10:35.180
compared to other people.

01:10:35.180 --> 01:10:37.498
He's basically a god, he's just not a god.

01:10:37.498 --> 01:10:38.974
You know what I mean?

01:10:38.974 --> 01:10:41.024
TRAVIS: (sighs) Yes.

01:10:42.191 --> 01:10:43.892
I've been a little concerned

01:10:43.892 --> 01:10:48.064
that maybe the Traveler's trying to become a god,

01:10:48.064 --> 01:10:50.837
and you might be helping him.

01:10:50.837 --> 01:10:52.800
LAURA: I don't think he wants to be a god.

01:10:52.800 --> 01:10:55.581
I mean, I really don't, based on conversations that we had.

01:10:55.581 --> 01:10:56.856
I think he's kind of over it.

01:10:56.856 --> 01:11:00.727
TRAVIS: You know, can I just toss out there, though, that

01:11:00.727 --> 01:11:03.173
when he told you he didn't want all that responsibility

01:11:03.173 --> 01:11:05.765
and he still makes you go forward with the gathering

01:11:05.765 --> 01:11:09.322
of numerous, numerous people on a volcanic island,

01:11:09.322 --> 01:11:12.146
they sound kind of like conflicting messages?

01:11:12.146 --> 01:11:14.685
LAURA: I am the one who chose the volcano, you know.

01:11:14.685 --> 01:11:16.348
TRAVIS: Yeah, but he could just cancel the whole thing

01:11:16.348 --> 01:11:19.000
at any time, and then responsibility gone.

01:11:19.000 --> 01:11:22.047
It just feels a little like he's telling you something

01:11:22.047 --> 01:11:25.047
opposite of what he's making you do.

01:11:26.293 --> 01:11:28.454
LAURA: Why would he do that?

01:11:28.454 --> 01:11:29.387
TRAVIS: I don't know.

01:11:29.387 --> 01:11:31.361
I just want to make sure that you're

01:11:31.361 --> 01:11:34.249
keeping your eyes open to any possibility.

01:11:34.249 --> 01:11:35.995
I know he's been with you your entire life,

01:11:35.995 --> 01:11:37.485
so I'm a little hesitant in saying it.

01:11:37.485 --> 01:11:41.609
I just don't want you to get hurt.

01:11:45.689 --> 01:11:47.055
LAURA: Thanks.

01:11:50.230 --> 01:11:52.523
I'll keep my eyes open.

01:11:52.523 --> 01:11:53.925
TRAVIS: Okay.

01:11:53.925 --> 01:11:55.993
LAURA: But he's really a good guy.

01:11:55.993 --> 01:11:59.310
TRAVIS: He's shown us nothing to the contrary.

01:12:01.926 --> 01:12:03.690
Okay, I'm going to go talk to Caduceus.

01:12:03.690 --> 01:12:05.993
LAURA: No, wait, I thought you
were going to go grab her boob?

01:12:05.993 --> 01:12:07.050
TRAVIS: I have to breast first!

01:12:07.050 --> 01:12:08.025
It's the shoulder.

01:12:08.025 --> 01:12:09.405
SAM: You have to breast first?

01:12:09.405 --> 01:12:10.769
TRAVIS: No, I--
LAURA: You have to breast first.

01:12:10.769 --> 01:12:11.602
He said breast.

01:12:11.602 --> 01:12:12.453
TRAVIS: Just a titty bit of time.

01:12:12.453 --> 01:12:14.640
LAURA: And Veth, stop listening
in on our private conversation.

01:12:14.640 --> 01:12:15.742
SAM: Oh, sorry, sorry.
ASHLEY: Titty bit of time.

01:12:15.742 --> 01:12:18.197
LAURA: Oh, man, everybody can hear us.

01:12:18.197 --> 01:12:19.453
LIAM: He needs to express it.

01:12:19.453 --> 01:12:20.286
TRAVIS: I'll be back.

01:12:20.286 --> 01:12:22.905
Can I go and tell Caduceus the same sort of thing

01:12:22.905 --> 01:12:24.848
and just the concept that maybe we

01:12:24.848 --> 01:12:27.048
could be able to lift something?

01:12:27.048 --> 01:12:30.738
TALIESIN: I was just starting to meditate when this-- what?

01:12:30.738 --> 01:12:31.691
TRAVIS: I'm so sorry.

01:12:31.691 --> 01:12:33.327
I know how important this time is to you.

01:12:33.327 --> 01:12:37.337
I just wanted to share the same thing I told Jester to you.

01:12:37.337 --> 01:12:40.587
TALIESIN: Oh, I don't know.

01:12:40.587 --> 01:12:42.358
This is really complicated and weird.

01:12:42.358 --> 01:12:43.907
I'm not sure. Maybe I have something.

01:12:43.907 --> 01:12:45.482
I don't know.

01:12:45.482 --> 01:12:47.469
I'm confused.

01:12:47.469 --> 01:12:49.640
TRAVIS: I just wanted to let you
know so if I, all of a sudden,

01:12:49.640 --> 01:12:53.447
reach out and grab a random
shoulder or elbow-- nothing else--

01:12:53.447 --> 01:12:54.423
that's what I'm trying to do.

01:12:54.423 --> 01:12:55.656
I'm not clumsy or anything.

01:12:55.656 --> 01:12:58.333
I'm just trying to see if we can...

01:12:58.333 --> 01:13:00.628
TALIESIN: No, that makes sense.

01:13:00.628 --> 01:13:01.907
LAURA: Go do it now, Fjord.

01:13:01.907 --> 01:13:03.237
TRAVIS: I'm resting! Stop talking about it!

01:13:03.237 --> 01:13:04.122
I have to go rest.

01:13:04.122 --> 01:13:05.445
I'm going to meditate.

01:13:05.445 --> 01:13:08.936
TALIESIN: I'm going to talk to the Wild
Mother. I'm going to see what I can--

01:13:08.936 --> 01:13:10.351
I have some questions.

01:13:10.351 --> 01:13:13.171
MATT: Okay, so you're going to go ahead and Commune?

01:13:13.171 --> 01:13:14.695
TALIESIN: Yeah, I'm going to cast Commune.

01:13:14.695 --> 01:13:15.778
MATT: All righty.

01:13:17.046 --> 01:13:18.237
TRAVIS: Eight, yes.

01:13:18.237 --> 01:13:19.445
MATT: So in the middle of this space here

01:13:19.445 --> 01:13:20.661
as everyone is resting themselves,

01:13:20.661 --> 01:13:24.302
you can vaguely hear the louder-than-normal snoring

01:13:24.302 --> 01:13:28.185
of Beauregard recovering in the middle of this strange,

01:13:28.185 --> 01:13:31.820
half-root wall, and as you close your eyes and connect

01:13:31.820 --> 01:13:34.911
with the rather intense nature around you,

01:13:34.911 --> 01:13:37.265
you can feel that warm embrace.

01:13:37.265 --> 01:13:41.623
The air, itself, becomes comforting and sweet,

01:13:41.623 --> 01:13:45.080
as opposed to the sticky, warm air that's been in the breeze

01:13:45.080 --> 01:13:47.477
that has been guiding you through
this portion of the jungle,

01:13:47.477 --> 01:13:50.560
and you can sense her smile upon you.

01:13:53.832 --> 01:13:56.458
TALIESIN: I'm feeling watched.

01:13:56.458 --> 01:14:00.283
Is Vokodo what's watching me?

01:14:01.536 --> 01:14:04.132
MATT: You feel a tug at your shoulder, the breeze

01:14:04.132 --> 01:14:08.166
as it pushes your face towards the direction of the volcano,

01:14:08.166 --> 01:14:10.607
and you take that as a confirmation, as yes.

01:14:14.878 --> 01:14:17.850
TALIESIN: Is Vokodo why people on this island forget?

01:14:19.016 --> 01:14:22.132
MATT: Still looking upon the mountain,

01:14:22.132 --> 01:14:25.341
you watch as your eyes focus on the mist,

01:14:25.341 --> 01:14:27.942
focus on the strange, dreamlike quality,

01:14:27.942 --> 01:14:30.169
and you sense within the mountain there is something

01:14:30.169 --> 01:14:34.281
that is indeed robbing people of their memories.

01:14:34.281 --> 01:14:37.389
So the answer, you imagine, would be yes.

01:14:45.435 --> 01:14:49.793
TALIESIN: Do I possess magic that can abate this effect?

01:14:51.409 --> 01:14:54.692
MATT: You feel a small, growing

01:14:56.076 --> 01:14:58.883
base of strength in the palm of your hand,

01:14:58.883 --> 01:15:01.500
and you sense the Wild Mother

01:15:01.500 --> 01:15:04.745
confidently acknowledging that you have the power

01:15:04.745 --> 01:15:06.245
within your grasp.

01:15:07.441 --> 01:15:08.358
Perhaps not at the moment,

01:15:08.358 --> 01:15:10.279
depending on what spells you have prepared,

01:15:10.279 --> 01:15:13.378
but you know you have it as a capability.

01:15:13.378 --> 01:15:14.378
TALIESIN: All right.

01:15:15.538 --> 01:15:16.804
(exhales)

01:15:21.008 --> 01:15:21.841
So...

01:15:24.449 --> 01:15:27.776
Yeah, Vokodo's watching us,

01:15:27.776 --> 01:15:32.125
and something about it

01:15:33.017 --> 01:15:34.925
is what's happening to these people.

01:15:34.925 --> 01:15:37.061
I don't know if it's intentional or unintentional,

01:15:37.061 --> 01:15:38.710
but it's connected.

01:15:38.710 --> 01:15:43.710
And if your power can't undo this,

01:15:44.312 --> 01:15:47.280
I'm pretty sure mine can, and I'd be curious

01:15:47.280 --> 01:15:49.799
to see what you're capable of.

01:15:49.799 --> 01:15:53.973
TRAVIS: Don't think it's much,
but I'm certainly open to trying.

01:15:53.973 --> 01:15:55.354
Vokodo's not a god, right?

01:15:55.354 --> 01:15:58.058
We established that. It's something else?

01:15:58.058 --> 01:15:59.256
TALIESIN: I don't know what it is.

01:15:59.256 --> 01:16:02.221
TRAVIS: We just saw this floating
island chase us in our ship.

01:16:02.221 --> 01:16:06.704
There's no chance that this island is something, right?

01:16:06.704 --> 01:16:07.537
TALIESIN: I mean--

01:16:08.862 --> 01:16:09.753
TRAVIS: Who reads books?

01:16:09.753 --> 01:16:14.230
You, you, who fucking knows if an island is a thing?

01:16:14.230 --> 01:16:15.238
LAURA: An island is a thing.

01:16:15.238 --> 01:16:16.560
LAURA: An island is-- It is.

01:16:16.560 --> 01:16:18.030
It's a massive landform.

01:16:18.030 --> 01:16:19.762
TRAVIS: No, is it a creature?
LAURA: It's in the middle of the ocean.

01:16:19.762 --> 01:16:21.386
TRAVIS: Are we on a creature right now?
TALIESIN: Surrounded on all sides?

01:16:21.386 --> 01:16:22.261
MARISHA: You just woke me up

01:16:22.261 --> 01:16:23.901
to ask if an island was a thing?

01:16:23.901 --> 01:16:24.845
TRAVIS: Yes, motherfucker!

01:16:24.845 --> 01:16:26.772
Listen, did you not see that astral dreadnought?

01:16:26.772 --> 01:16:28.210
There is some big shit in this world.

01:16:28.210 --> 01:16:29.928
Are we on the back of something?

01:16:29.928 --> 01:16:31.208
MARISHA: I have no context.

01:16:31.208 --> 01:16:32.701
I was asleep, what are you--

01:16:32.701 --> 01:16:34.234
LIAM: The only knowledge of this island--
LAURA: Go back to sleep, Beau.

01:16:34.234 --> 01:16:36.551
LIAM: -- we have is through Jester.

01:16:36.551 --> 01:16:38.286
ASHLEY: Wait, what do you mean "a thing"?

01:16:38.286 --> 01:16:39.863
LAURA: I'm going to just fan Beau

01:16:39.863 --> 01:16:41.429
to give her a little bit of a breeze.

01:16:41.429 --> 01:16:42.262
Go back to sleep.

01:16:42.262 --> 01:16:44.455
ASHLEY: Do we have any water?

01:16:44.455 --> 01:16:45.884
MATT: Yeah, you brought water along with the journey,

01:16:45.884 --> 01:16:48.684
and Viridian, actually, is easy enough to create

01:16:48.684 --> 01:16:49.836
any fresh water if you need it.

01:16:49.836 --> 01:16:52.595
SAM: Also, Yasha, I think you still have my flask.

01:16:55.736 --> 01:16:58.053
(laughter)

01:16:58.053 --> 01:17:00.349
TRAVIS: Four months later.
ASHLEY: You're probably right.

01:17:00.349 --> 01:17:01.932
I do.

01:17:02.926 --> 01:17:04.942
SAM: So feel free.

01:17:04.942 --> 01:17:08.557
ASHLEY: Okay, I'm going to wet a little bit of a rag

01:17:09.632 --> 01:17:12.936
from my cape and dab Beau's wrists

01:17:12.936 --> 01:17:14.962
and then put it around her neck so she can cool down

01:17:14.962 --> 01:17:16.609
while she's sleeping.
TRAVIS: With vodka?

01:17:16.609 --> 01:17:19.042
MARISHA: Is that whiskey? Feels nice.

01:17:19.042 --> 01:17:19.875
ASHLEY: Just some cold-- yeah.

01:17:19.875 --> 01:17:21.345
MARISHA: Yeah, it's good.

01:17:21.345 --> 01:17:23.119
ASHLEY: What do you mean by thing?

01:17:23.119 --> 01:17:24.544
TRAVIS: No, I just mean like--

01:17:24.544 --> 01:17:27.558
I'd only heard of dragon turtles.

01:17:27.558 --> 01:17:28.847
I'd never seen one before,

01:17:28.847 --> 01:17:30.560
and it was fucking huge and terrifying.

01:17:30.560 --> 01:17:33.181
If it's not a god, and we're on this island

01:17:33.181 --> 01:17:35.050
that's already changed colors and shapes

01:17:35.050 --> 01:17:36.302
and the wildlife has changed--

01:17:36.302 --> 01:17:40.033
SAM: Captain Tusktooth, wasn't this island on a map, though?

01:17:40.033 --> 01:17:42.741
TRAVIS: Yes, but I couldn't tell you

01:17:42.741 --> 01:17:44.060
if it was properly charted

01:17:44.060 --> 01:17:46.106
or explored or any of that.

01:17:46.106 --> 01:17:47.683
SAM: Well, you found it.

01:17:47.683 --> 01:17:49.644
TRAVIS: Yeah, but what this is like a--

01:17:49.644 --> 01:17:51.460
LIAM: What are you asking? If this island is alive?

01:17:51.460 --> 01:17:53.426
TRAVIS: Yes! Yes, that!

01:17:53.426 --> 01:17:55.748
LIAM: Have I ever read about a living island

01:17:55.748 --> 01:17:57.087
in all of my booking?

01:17:57.087 --> 01:17:58.865
MATT: Roll arcana or history, your choice.

01:17:58.865 --> 01:17:59.698
LIAM: Arcana, please.

01:17:59.698 --> 01:18:01.900
MARISHA: Can I do the same?

01:18:01.900 --> 01:18:03.068
MATT: If you're not still napping, yeah.

01:18:03.068 --> 01:18:06.054
MARISHA: I'm being pampered on right now.

01:18:06.054 --> 01:18:07.364
I'm living my best life.

01:18:07.364 --> 01:18:08.473
MATT: Sure, if you want to pay attention to this.

01:18:08.473 --> 01:18:09.306
Go for it.

01:18:10.462 --> 01:18:11.340
LIAM: 28.

01:18:11.340 --> 01:18:12.173
MATT: 28.

01:18:12.173 --> 01:18:14.618
TRAVIS: Booze on your wrists.

01:18:14.618 --> 01:18:16.088
MARISHA: 25.
MATT: 25, yeah.

01:18:16.088 --> 01:18:19.040
There have been myths through the ages of landmasses

01:18:19.040 --> 01:18:21.703
that turned out to be creatures,

01:18:21.703 --> 01:18:23.431
whether that be like the dragon turtle example

01:18:23.431 --> 01:18:25.547
of what you met

01:18:25.547 --> 01:18:29.288
in the sea not too long before,

01:18:29.288 --> 01:18:33.518
creations by the gods during pre-Calamity times

01:18:33.518 --> 01:18:36.028
and the time of the Founding.

01:18:36.028 --> 01:18:40.549
The very primal elemental titans that once ruled

01:18:40.549 --> 01:18:44.797
this land themselves had whole groups of creatures

01:18:44.797 --> 01:18:46.362
that called them homes, depending,

01:18:46.362 --> 01:18:48.595
like the earth elemental titans themselves

01:18:48.595 --> 01:18:51.894
had an entire biome that existed

01:18:51.894 --> 01:18:54.101
within them as a walking mountain.

01:18:54.101 --> 01:18:56.445
There've been examples of it through time.

01:18:56.445 --> 01:18:58.266
It's not a common thing, necessarily,

01:18:58.266 --> 01:18:59.757
and you can't--

01:19:01.316 --> 01:19:02.602
I would say you're hard pressed to think

01:19:02.602 --> 01:19:04.319
of any specific examples of modern time

01:19:04.319 --> 01:19:06.110
of islands being a living thing.

01:19:06.110 --> 01:19:07.635
It doesn't sound out of the world--

01:19:07.635 --> 01:19:09.129
you've been to so many weird places

01:19:09.129 --> 01:19:10.135
and learned about so many weird things.

01:19:10.135 --> 01:19:11.192
Sure, it's possible.

01:19:11.192 --> 01:19:14.006
LIAM: I would imagine that the things I have read about

01:19:14.006 --> 01:19:15.988
were on a smaller scale than this island

01:19:15.988 --> 01:19:17.806
even though the island is not that big.

01:19:17.806 --> 01:19:19.472
It's a big place.
MATT: Correct.

01:19:19.472 --> 01:19:21.450
LIAM: I say to Fjord.

01:19:21.450 --> 01:19:22.769
TRAVIS: Fair enough, makes sense.

01:19:22.769 --> 01:19:24.269
LAURA: But if it is a living thing,

01:19:24.269 --> 01:19:27.544
then maybe the volcano's just like a giant zit or something.

01:19:27.544 --> 01:19:30.191
ASHLEY: Yeah, but isn't all land a living thing?

01:19:30.191 --> 01:19:31.257
TALIESIN: Yes.

01:19:31.257 --> 01:19:32.175
ASHLEY: You know?

01:19:32.175 --> 01:19:34.390
LIAM: Well, <i>ja</i>, but--

01:19:34.390 --> 01:19:36.098
MARISHA: We're, like, all connected, right?

01:19:36.098 --> 01:19:36.931
Right, Caduceus?
SAM: Oh, boy.

01:19:36.931 --> 01:19:38.160
What's happening right now?

01:19:38.160 --> 01:19:39.501
LAURA: I have no idea.
TRAVIS: We're short rest.

01:19:39.501 --> 01:19:41.240
We're being eccentric.

01:19:41.240 --> 01:19:42.540
SAM: Philosophical.
TRAVIS: Yep.

01:19:42.540 --> 01:19:45.141
Waxing...big word.

01:19:45.141 --> 01:19:47.912
MATT: At this point, as you guys are finishing out the end

01:19:47.912 --> 01:19:49.434
of the short rest and having this conversation,

01:19:49.434 --> 01:19:52.279
you watch as Viridian's staff suddenly goes to her side,

01:19:52.279 --> 01:19:55.746
and she stands up very carefully and goes,

01:19:55.746 --> 01:19:56.971
"Do you hear that?"

01:19:56.971 --> 01:19:58.561
SAM: No.
LAURA: Do we hear anything?

01:19:58.561 --> 01:19:59.561
TALIESIN: Hear what?

01:20:00.721 --> 01:20:05.342
MATT: Actually, it would be Caduceus
and Beauregard and Caleb.

01:20:05.342 --> 01:20:07.030
MARISHA: Did we get a rest in?

01:20:07.030 --> 01:20:09.478
MATT: Yeah, you guys finished your short rest,

01:20:09.478 --> 01:20:11.641
but at the end of it, as you listen in,

01:20:11.641 --> 01:20:15.779
and you can hear what sounds like shifting of wood,

01:20:15.779 --> 01:20:16.956
breaking of branches.

01:20:16.956 --> 01:20:18.430
TRAVIS: Oh, good.
SAM: The island is mad.

01:20:18.430 --> 01:20:19.814
LAURA: Like distant or close?

01:20:19.814 --> 01:20:22.243
MATT: Distant and getting closer--
LIAM: Everybody quiet down and get down, please.

01:20:22.243 --> 01:20:26.722
MATT: -- and then you hear another
branch snap louder and closer,

01:20:26.722 --> 01:20:29.066
and you hear things moving, shifting,

01:20:29.066 --> 01:20:31.589
leaves and boughs crashing into each other,

01:20:31.589 --> 01:20:32.912
and it's getting louder and louder.

01:20:32.912 --> 01:20:33.745
MARISHA: I feel like we should move away from it.

01:20:33.745 --> 01:20:35.353
TRAVIS: Like (thooms) of footsteps, something big

01:20:35.353 --> 01:20:36.558
or just the trees moving?

01:20:36.558 --> 01:20:37.674
MATT: At the moment right now,

01:20:37.674 --> 01:20:39.884
just hearing of trees and foliage moving.

01:20:39.884 --> 01:20:41.542
MARISHA: Let's go that way.
TRAVIS: Hide, hide?

01:20:41.542 --> 01:20:42.375
MARISHA: Let's run.

01:20:42.375 --> 01:20:44.196
LAURA: What do you think it is, Viridian?
TRAVIS: Or should we take cover?

01:20:44.196 --> 01:20:45.176
SAM: I'm going to hide.
MARISHA: Hide?

01:20:45.176 --> 01:20:46.009
SAM: I'm going to just hide

01:20:46.009 --> 01:20:47.794
and throw some bushes over me.
MATT: Okay, hiding?

01:20:47.794 --> 01:20:48.871
Anyone who's hiding, make a stealth check.

01:20:48.871 --> 01:20:50.534
LIAM: I'm going to pull out a bit of fleece

01:20:50.534 --> 01:20:55.138
and start to cast Major Image and just create

01:20:55.138 --> 01:20:59.630
similar fauna to what's around us,
but obscuring the party entirely.

01:20:59.630 --> 01:21:00.747
TRAVIS: Nice.
MATT: Okay.

01:21:00.747 --> 01:21:02.516
So as you guys are all having this conversation,

01:21:02.516 --> 01:21:05.987
you watch as the jungle area around you suddenly is filled

01:21:05.987 --> 01:21:10.088
with immaterial leaves and branches and knotted roots

01:21:10.088 --> 01:21:13.726
and vines, and you all feel fairly well hidden.

01:21:13.726 --> 01:21:16.997
As you all wait and Viridian looks back towards you

01:21:16.997 --> 01:21:19.826
and gives a nod of like, "Well done,"

01:21:19.826 --> 01:21:21.219
you hear getting louder and louder,

01:21:21.219 --> 01:21:24.777
and now you hear footfalls (crunching),

01:21:24.777 --> 01:21:27.926
not incredibly heavy, but heavy enough,

01:21:27.926 --> 01:21:29.650
and you see a shape now moving

01:21:29.650 --> 01:21:32.628
maybe about 30 feet ahead, not directly towards you

01:21:32.628 --> 01:21:35.169
from what you can tell right now, but shifting

01:21:35.169 --> 01:21:37.556
parallel to the direction you were traveling,

01:21:37.556 --> 01:21:39.780
and then you can hear heavier footfalls behind it.

01:21:39.780 --> 01:21:44.404
(booming) The cracking and breaking sound of heavy trees

01:21:44.404 --> 01:21:46.730
and branch gets louder and louder like thunder.

01:21:46.730 --> 01:21:50.284
You can see the shifting and moving of heavy tree boughs

01:21:50.284 --> 01:21:52.173
just at the top of the horizon

01:21:52.173 --> 01:21:54.560
beyond where the break in the canopy would be,

01:21:54.560 --> 01:21:57.172
and you watch as a tree (crunches) falls over.

01:21:57.172 --> 01:21:59.895
Suddenly, you see a blur of gray as you see a massive,

01:21:59.895 --> 01:22:04.385
12-foot tall creature with four arms, gray skin,

01:22:04.385 --> 01:22:08.787
a white, silver matte of a stripe of hair down its back,

01:22:08.787 --> 01:22:13.081
this open jaw with sharp teeth come rushing through.

01:22:14.687 --> 01:22:18.708
Go ahead and make an arcana check, Beauregard and Caleb.

01:22:18.708 --> 01:22:20.427
SAM: Beauregard.
TRAVIS: What the fuck?

01:22:20.427 --> 01:22:21.541
LIAM: 25.

01:22:21.541 --> 01:22:22.602
MATT: 25.

01:22:23.494 --> 01:22:24.793
MARISHA: 23.

01:22:24.793 --> 01:22:27.476
MATT: Okay, you both, looking at it,

01:22:27.476 --> 01:22:30.047
you recognize some of the features,

01:22:30.047 --> 01:22:33.521
elements of the coloration of the skin are vaguely drow,

01:22:33.521 --> 01:22:36.227
but monstrous and mutated, and you immediately recall

01:22:36.227 --> 01:22:40.824
you've heard of in some of the darker drow societies

01:22:40.824 --> 01:22:43.530
there being a blending of drow blood and demonic blood

01:22:43.530 --> 01:22:46.463
to create something called a draegloth,

01:22:46.463 --> 01:22:49.536
but they are creatures that
almost exclusively live in the Underdark

01:22:49.536 --> 01:22:52.448
and to see it here makes no sense,

01:22:52.448 --> 01:22:54.136
and it's rushing--
MARISHA: They live in the Underdark?

01:22:54.136 --> 01:22:56.386
MATT: Yes.
TRAVIS: Almost exclusively.

01:22:57.327 --> 01:22:59.639
MATT: As you see it-- As soon as that hits you,

01:22:59.639 --> 01:23:01.068
you watch as it comes rushing forward

01:23:01.068 --> 01:23:04.047
and you can see there is blood streaking down its face,

01:23:04.047 --> 01:23:07.155
and the look on its-- the expression on its

01:23:07.155 --> 01:23:09.838
large, demonic, twisted face

01:23:09.838 --> 01:23:13.028
is that of desperation, and you hear

01:23:13.028 --> 01:23:16.761
(heavy footsteps) coming up from behind it

01:23:16.761 --> 01:23:18.961
as (crash)

01:23:18.961 --> 01:23:20.565
breaking through the nearby trees,

01:23:20.565 --> 01:23:23.874
you watch a giant toothed mouth, jaws open,

01:23:23.874 --> 01:23:25.492
snatch it from the middle of its leap

01:23:25.492 --> 01:23:27.186
as it gets pulled in the air.

01:23:27.186 --> 01:23:29.444
You can see a large,

01:23:29.444 --> 01:23:33.834
lizard-like entity standing about 20 to 25 feet tall,

01:23:33.834 --> 01:23:36.922
this massive mouth of foot-long like-dagger teeth

01:23:36.922 --> 01:23:39.419
as it lifts in the air and chomps into it.

01:23:39.419 --> 01:23:42.018
Blood pours out of the side of it as the large draegloth

01:23:42.018 --> 01:23:44.147
is like (growls).

01:23:44.147 --> 01:23:46.450
(crunches) A secondary horrible crunch sound

01:23:46.450 --> 01:23:47.510
and it's silent.

01:23:47.510 --> 01:23:49.635
You now can see standing, this massive lizard creature,

01:23:49.635 --> 01:23:52.762
similar to the ones being cooked at Vo the night before,

01:23:52.762 --> 01:23:55.824
but much larger with these smaller, vestigial arms

01:23:55.824 --> 01:23:58.053
by comparison as it (crunches).
TRAVIS: Is it a t-rex?

01:23:58.053 --> 01:23:59.802
SAM: It's like Land of the Lost.

01:23:59.802 --> 01:24:01.570
ASHLEY: Yeah.
LIAM: It sure is.

01:24:01.570 --> 01:24:06.487
MATT: Chews (gulps, sniffs).

01:24:07.461 --> 01:24:10.976
So, now, everyone, make a stealth--

01:24:10.976 --> 01:24:12.268
TRAVIS: Means it's based on movement.

01:24:12.268 --> 01:24:13.823
MATT: Yeah, I know.
MARISHA: Yeah!

01:24:13.823 --> 01:24:14.739
MATT: Just make a stealth check

01:24:14.739 --> 01:24:15.890
in general.
LAURA: We don't know that.

01:24:15.890 --> 01:24:17.111
MATT: Just make a stealth check in general.

01:24:17.111 --> 01:24:18.152
TRAVIS: Oh no!

01:24:18.152 --> 01:24:19.135
ASHLEY: Make a stealth check, okay.

01:24:19.135 --> 01:24:21.053
LIAM: Does the Major Image help with that at all?

01:24:21.053 --> 01:24:21.913
MATT: You'll find out.

01:24:21.913 --> 01:24:24.872
LAURA: Oh my god.

01:24:24.872 --> 01:24:26.196
TRAVIS: Oh, I'm so happy right now.

01:24:26.196 --> 01:24:27.699
LAURA: I'm so scared to roll.
TRAVIS: You guys, there's a t-rex

01:24:27.699 --> 01:24:30.237
on this fucking thing or an allosaurus.

01:24:30.237 --> 01:24:31.964
LAURA: No! (laughs)

01:24:31.964 --> 01:24:33.768
LIAM: No good.
LAURA: No, no!

01:24:33.768 --> 01:24:35.186
SAM: It's a group check, it's a group check.

01:24:35.186 --> 01:24:36.199
We'll be fine.
MATT: It is a group check.

01:24:36.199 --> 01:24:37.410
LIAM: Yeah.
SAM: We'll be fine, guys.

01:24:37.410 --> 01:24:39.418
LIAM: ♪ You lift me up ♪

01:24:39.418 --> 01:24:41.127
(laughter)
MATT: So, Fjord.

01:24:41.127 --> 01:24:42.634
TRAVIS: 15.
MATT: 15.

01:24:43.656 --> 01:24:44.833
(groaning)

01:24:44.833 --> 01:24:46.827
MATT: That counts as two failures.
LIAM: Seven.

01:24:46.827 --> 01:24:49.234
MATT: Okay.
MARISHA: (gasps) That's two failures?

01:24:49.234 --> 01:24:51.387
SAM: 25.
LIAM: Yeah, yeah.

01:24:51.387 --> 01:24:52.220
ASHLEY: 17.

01:24:52.220 --> 01:24:53.511
LIAM: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
TALIESIN: Seven.

01:24:53.511 --> 01:24:55.194
MARISHA: 15.

01:24:55.194 --> 01:24:56.157
LAURA: Uh-oh.

01:24:56.157 --> 01:24:58.558
LIAM: But Beauregard.
ASHLEY: Wait.

01:24:58.558 --> 01:24:59.391
SAM: That's one, two, three,

01:24:59.391 --> 01:25:00.457
four failures.

01:25:00.457 --> 01:25:02.253
MARISHA: Is that four failures?
SAM: And four successes.

01:25:02.253 --> 01:25:04.122
LIAM: Bring out the t-rex!

01:25:04.122 --> 01:25:06.078
MATT: You watch as it kind of like--

01:25:06.078 --> 01:25:08.915
It's about 40 feet from you at this point and

01:25:08.915 --> 01:25:13.071
(gurgles) its big leathery tongue is curling across the

01:25:13.071 --> 01:25:16.329
outside of its teeth.
The thick, dark purple blood

01:25:16.329 --> 01:25:19.097
that's dripping from the bottom of its jaw from the remnants

01:25:19.097 --> 01:25:21.534
of where the draegloth's body was torn open

01:25:21.534 --> 01:25:22.571
and then swallowed.

01:25:22.571 --> 01:25:24.705
It starts sniffing (sniffs).

01:25:24.705 --> 01:25:27.049
ASHLEY: I put my hand on the hilt
of my Skingorger just in case.

01:25:27.049 --> 01:25:28.599
Getting ready.
TALIESIN: I'm...

01:25:30.199 --> 01:25:31.749
going to cast Thaumaturgy.

01:25:31.749 --> 01:25:32.891
SAM: What?

01:25:32.891 --> 01:25:34.107
MATT: What are you doing?

01:25:34.107 --> 01:25:39.107
TALIESIN: I'm creating a sound of
a group of people 30 feet away

01:25:39.107 --> 01:25:42.577
just off our axis, out of its sight.

01:25:42.577 --> 01:25:46.660
MATT: Okay, roll a deception check, if you don't mind.

01:25:48.445 --> 01:25:49.474
TALIESIN: Deception check?

01:25:49.474 --> 01:25:51.656
MATT: Yep, just make a standard roll.
TRAVIS: Get rid of the flare!

01:25:51.656 --> 01:25:53.293
MATT: But you can add your wisdom modifier to it.

01:25:53.293 --> 01:25:54.209
TALIESIN: Okay, thank you.

01:25:54.209 --> 01:25:56.525
MARISHA: (laughs)

01:25:56.525 --> 01:25:58.750
TALIESIN: Natural 20.
TRAVIS: Yeah!

01:25:58.750 --> 01:26:00.393
TALIESIN: Never mind.

01:26:00.393 --> 01:26:04.324
MATT: As the sound of rustling and voices off to the side,

01:26:04.324 --> 01:26:08.549
the creature immediately (growls)

01:26:08.549 --> 01:26:10.982
(receding thudding)

01:26:10.982 --> 01:26:12.507
LIAM: I'm so mad at you, Taliesin.
LAURA: It's not that far away.

01:26:12.507 --> 01:26:13.732
MATT: Begins charging--
LIAM: I'm so mad at him.

01:26:13.732 --> 01:26:15.414
MATT: -- away from it.

01:26:15.414 --> 01:26:16.949
MARISHA: For what, because you want to fight it so bad?

01:26:16.949 --> 01:26:18.404
SAM: I want to fight it so bad.
MATT: You guys waiting?

01:26:18.404 --> 01:26:19.886
LIAM: I want to fight a t-rex.

01:26:19.886 --> 01:26:20.990
SAM: Let's go chase after it.

01:26:20.990 --> 01:26:22.260
TRAVIS: You want to go to get it?

01:26:22.260 --> 01:26:23.384
ASHLEY: Hey!
TRAVIS: We could mind control it.

01:26:23.384 --> 01:26:25.636
LIAM: Caleb doesn't want to! I do.

01:26:25.636 --> 01:26:26.946
(laughter)

01:26:26.946 --> 01:26:28.617
TRAVIS: Come on, 80 hit points, we got this.

01:26:28.617 --> 01:26:31.687
MATT: You can hear it now. It's off to the side.

01:26:31.687 --> 01:26:35.802
You can hear it angrily (growls and crunches)

01:26:35.802 --> 01:26:40.239
another the tree (rumble) slams near off.

01:26:40.239 --> 01:26:41.374
You can see some of the dust get kicked up

01:26:41.374 --> 01:26:42.649
and blown in this direction.

01:26:42.649 --> 01:26:44.873
It's searching for whatever the source of the sound is

01:26:44.873 --> 01:26:46.688
about 40 feet off from where you guys are.

01:26:46.688 --> 01:26:48.522
MARISHA: Oh god, that's not far.
SAM: Should we sneak away?

01:26:48.522 --> 01:26:49.355
MARISHA: Let's sneak, let's sneak.

01:26:49.355 --> 01:26:50.944
LAURA: Yeah, we probably should.
MARISHA: Let's go, let's go.

01:26:50.944 --> 01:26:52.095
LAURA: Should we fly? (laughs)

01:26:52.095 --> 01:26:55.037
LIAM: How about we don't move for a moment?

01:26:55.037 --> 01:26:56.553
Don't move at all.

01:26:56.553 --> 01:26:59.698
TRAVIS: (quietly) Yeah, Viridian,
have you seen one of these?

01:26:59.698 --> 01:27:01.682
MATT: (whispering) "I have."

01:27:01.682 --> 01:27:03.966
TRAVIS: Do we run or freeze?

01:27:03.966 --> 01:27:07.754
MATT: "Either. I usually run, but I can fly."

01:27:07.754 --> 01:27:09.929
(laughter)

01:27:09.929 --> 01:27:10.852
TRAVIS: That doesn't help us.

01:27:10.852 --> 01:27:14.543
SAM: She keeps bringing that up
every two seconds, by the way.

01:27:14.543 --> 01:27:17.803
ASHLEY: Yeah, we get it. You can fly.
TRAVIS: Caleb, should we freeze?

01:27:17.803 --> 01:27:18.803
LIAM: Not today.

01:27:19.978 --> 01:27:21.256
TRAVIS: We don't move, or we move?

01:27:21.256 --> 01:27:22.296
LIAM: No, we stay put.

01:27:22.296 --> 01:27:24.083
TRAVIS: Okay.
LIAM: I cannot fly today.

01:27:24.083 --> 01:27:26.745
I mean, I can fly, but you cannot fly.

01:27:26.745 --> 01:27:31.182
MATT: (thumping footsteps)
MARISHA: (whispering) I feel like its nose

01:27:31.182 --> 01:27:33.764
was really strong--
LAURA: (shushes)

01:27:33.764 --> 01:27:37.708
SAM: (normal voice) Caleb, did you
see that spell I cast earlier?

01:27:37.708 --> 01:27:39.952
(laughter)
TRAVIS: I just put my hand

01:27:39.952 --> 01:27:41.803
over Nott's mouth.

01:27:41.803 --> 01:27:46.141
(slow heavy footsteps)

01:27:46.141 --> 01:27:47.497
MATT: You see it starts rubbing its nose against the trunk

01:27:47.497 --> 01:27:49.440
of one of the trees, like trying to scratch an itch.

01:27:49.440 --> 01:27:51.245
(crunches and growls)

01:27:51.245 --> 01:27:52.996
LAURA: It's so cute.
ASHLEY: I love him.

01:27:52.996 --> 01:27:55.160
LIAM: Yeah, I was going to try to start that conversation--

01:27:55.160 --> 01:27:56.911
LAURA: Shut up!
LIAM: -- but the group moved on without me.

01:27:56.911 --> 01:27:57.867
SAM: Well, we could have it right now.

01:27:57.867 --> 01:28:02.819
MATT: (receding thumping)

01:28:02.819 --> 01:28:06.641
MATT: (receding thumping)

01:28:06.641 --> 01:28:09.586
The footsteps get quieter and quieter.

01:28:09.586 --> 01:28:11.313
The distraction combined with the illusion,

01:28:11.313 --> 01:28:14.228
it did not happen to see through, the lack of movement,

01:28:14.228 --> 01:28:17.469
and you technically failed on the stealth check,

01:28:17.469 --> 01:28:19.149
but the illusion was enough to offset it--

01:28:19.149 --> 01:28:22.724
TRAVIS: Oh, smart fucking wizards.
MATT: -- and the Thaumaturgy distracted it enough

01:28:22.724 --> 01:28:24.403
where it didn't zero in.
ASHLEY: Yes, let's go.

01:28:24.403 --> 01:28:26.030
LIAM: Robbed me of a T-Rex battle.

01:28:26.030 --> 01:28:28.642
MATT: (laughs) It's okay, another day.

01:28:28.642 --> 01:28:30.442
TRAVIS: Oh, hold him up,

01:28:30.442 --> 01:28:32.272
hold him up.
MATT: It's a shitty little T-Rex

01:28:32.272 --> 01:28:34.280
that I brought up.
(laughter)

01:28:34.280 --> 01:28:35.264
TALIESIN: So cute.

01:28:35.264 --> 01:28:37.167
ASHLEY: I love him.
LAURA: That's a cute T-Rex.

01:28:37.167 --> 01:28:38.714
TRAVIS: Damn.
TALIESIN: Glue some feathers on it.

01:28:38.714 --> 01:28:40.118
ASHLEY: Wow.

01:28:40.118 --> 01:28:43.366
MATT: So you wait for a sufficient amount of time

01:28:43.366 --> 01:28:46.516
in hopes that it's enough to not gather its attention

01:28:46.516 --> 01:28:48.627
and that it's found a new destruction or continued

01:28:48.627 --> 01:28:50.693
with whatever its venture may be.
LAURA: We could've ridden it.

01:28:50.693 --> 01:28:53.074
We could ride it all the way to volcano.

01:28:53.074 --> 01:28:54.848
SAM: Oh, man.

01:28:54.848 --> 01:28:57.774
Vokodo would have to take heed from us if we were coming

01:28:57.774 --> 01:28:59.726
in riding on a fucking dinosaur.

01:28:59.726 --> 01:29:01.086
MATT: (laughs)

01:29:01.086 --> 01:29:02.812
LAURA: Yeah, man.

01:29:02.812 --> 01:29:07.091
MATT: Pushing forward, Viridian begins to lead the way.

01:29:07.091 --> 01:29:09.915
At this point, you're hitting dusk.

01:29:09.915 --> 01:29:14.240
The sky itself is a bright orange turning red,

01:29:14.240 --> 01:29:18.077
and you can barely see now, passed the distance

01:29:18.077 --> 01:29:22.120
to the eastern side, the purples and blues

01:29:22.120 --> 01:29:25.613
that begin to usher in the rest of the dark night.

01:29:25.613 --> 01:29:27.888
You could hear some semblance of nighttime insects

01:29:27.888 --> 01:29:30.461
and crickets starting to make their noises,

01:29:30.461 --> 01:29:33.224
various denizens of the night coming alive.

01:29:33.224 --> 01:29:34.313
However, at the same time,

01:29:34.313 --> 01:29:35.755
you are approaching the base of the mountain.

01:29:35.755 --> 01:29:37.342
You guys are now hitting a steady incline,

01:29:37.342 --> 01:29:39.793
and it's turned from a walk into a hike,

01:29:39.793 --> 01:29:40.741
and following Viridian,

01:29:40.741 --> 01:29:44.201
as you begin to follow the switchback trail naturally

01:29:44.201 --> 01:29:47.199
up the side of the mountain, that same kind of weird,

01:29:47.199 --> 01:29:51.732
dreamlike haze still sits over this jungle

01:29:51.732 --> 01:29:54.062
and the mountain before you.

01:29:55.084 --> 01:29:57.565
You get closer and closer to it,

01:29:57.565 --> 01:29:59.028
and by the time night comes,

01:29:59.028 --> 01:30:01.671
and you watch as Viridian lights the edge of the staff.

01:30:01.671 --> 01:30:03.055
Any of you who have light sources,

01:30:03.055 --> 01:30:06.064
it would be recommended to create one at this moment

01:30:06.064 --> 01:30:07.825
as it is getting near impossible to see

01:30:07.825 --> 01:30:09.457
or those who don't need to necessarily.

01:30:09.457 --> 01:30:12.129
TRAVIS: Yeah, summon the sword, light.

01:30:12.129 --> 01:30:15.488
LIAM: Four globules. (plops)

01:30:15.488 --> 01:30:19.212
MATT: Then, within a short trek up the side of the mountain,

01:30:19.212 --> 01:30:21.355
Viridian goes, "There.

01:30:21.355 --> 01:30:24.036
"That is the entrance," and she points her staff towards.

01:30:24.036 --> 01:30:26.168
You can see the pathway levels out

01:30:26.168 --> 01:30:30.467
and there is a cave opening about 20 feet from end to end

01:30:30.467 --> 01:30:32.955
and a jagged top that's about 10 feet,

01:30:32.955 --> 01:30:36.383
sometimes closer to 12 feet at its apex,

01:30:36.383 --> 01:30:39.808
and it is just pitch black unto the inside of the mountain.

01:30:39.808 --> 01:30:41.763
SAM: Is it customary to go in at night

01:30:41.763 --> 01:30:45.024
or do we have to wait till daybreak?

01:30:45.024 --> 01:30:46.304
MATT: "I believe any time.

01:30:46.304 --> 01:30:50.379
"I do not think that Vokodo rests."

01:30:50.379 --> 01:30:52.633
LAURA: He doesn't sleep at all?

01:30:52.633 --> 01:30:56.198
MATT: "Well, what sleep do you need when you are a god?"

01:30:56.198 --> 01:30:57.664
LAURA: I don't know, I mean...

01:30:58.889 --> 01:31:00.891
dreaming is really fun, you know?

01:31:00.891 --> 01:31:02.983
He's missing out.

01:31:02.983 --> 01:31:04.907
Maybe that's why everything's crazy around here, you know?

01:31:04.907 --> 01:31:08.219
Maybe his dreams are crossing over into the real world.

01:31:08.219 --> 01:31:10.386
MATT: She laughs a little bit.

01:31:11.416 --> 01:31:13.333
"I think he'll like you."

01:31:14.253 --> 01:31:16.272
SAM: All right, then we'll go now.

01:31:16.272 --> 01:31:18.467
TALIESIN: I think that's a good theory.

01:31:18.467 --> 01:31:19.635
MARISHA: It's kind of a great theory.

01:31:19.635 --> 01:31:20.942
TALIESIN: Yeah, I'm into it.

01:31:20.942 --> 01:31:23.091
MATT: All right, as you approach the mouth

01:31:23.091 --> 01:31:24.267
of the cavern entrance,

01:31:24.267 --> 01:31:29.267
the volcanic smells of the island become more mineral rich.

01:31:29.805 --> 01:31:31.731
The lush plants and ferns that have taken residence

01:31:31.731 --> 01:31:35.345
around this space here are wedged in the earthy cracks

01:31:35.345 --> 01:31:39.231
of the mountainside are vibrant and a very, very healthy,

01:31:39.231 --> 01:31:40.987
larger than counterparts you've seen

01:31:40.987 --> 01:31:42.644
along the Menagerie Coast and other elements

01:31:42.644 --> 01:31:46.350
of the tropical jungles and the surrounding area.

01:31:47.925 --> 01:31:50.728
The winds are a little strong, though,
as you get close to it,

01:31:50.728 --> 01:31:53.805
towards the crest where this entrance is,

01:31:53.805 --> 01:31:56.830
and you reinforce your footsteps instinctually.

01:31:58.831 --> 01:32:01.456
As you reach the foot of this cavern,

01:32:03.455 --> 01:32:07.356
there is a faint wind coming from the inside.

01:32:07.356 --> 01:32:10.596
The air is actually warmer at the opening

01:32:10.596 --> 01:32:12.506
of this cavern than the surrounding space.

01:32:12.506 --> 01:32:14.397
As night has come, the temperature has dropped,

01:32:14.397 --> 01:32:16.352
but as you get to the front of this cavern,

01:32:16.352 --> 01:32:19.545
the temperature spikes another 15 degrees or so.

01:32:19.545 --> 01:32:22.144
TRAVIS: Is it real lush and green still,

01:32:22.144 --> 01:32:24.078
not rocky or hot or arid?

01:32:24.078 --> 01:32:26.119
MATT: Well, it is rocky here at the base,

01:32:26.119 --> 01:32:27.594
but within the cracks of the rocks,

01:32:27.594 --> 01:32:30.803
you can see there are a lot of other elements of vegetation

01:32:30.803 --> 01:32:33.127
that have taken root, and it turns rocky the further

01:32:33.127 --> 01:32:35.643
up the mountain you go, but at this entrance as you enter,

01:32:35.643 --> 01:32:38.302
it just looks like it just goes into volcanic rock,

01:32:38.302 --> 01:32:39.807
porous, black, volcanic rock.

01:32:39.807 --> 01:32:42.237
TRAVIS: Pretty steep where we are right now?

01:32:42.237 --> 01:32:44.101
MATT: It was a little steep getting up there,

01:32:44.101 --> 01:32:46.502
but there's a level off platform right where this enters

01:32:46.502 --> 01:32:48.317
where you guys have even footing

01:32:48.317 --> 01:32:50.674
now that you've gotten there.

01:32:50.674 --> 01:32:53.574
LAURA: Hey, Traveler, you here?

01:32:55.185 --> 01:32:58.226
Artagan, are you here?

01:32:59.513 --> 01:33:01.979
SAM: This is somebody else's house, Jester.

01:33:01.979 --> 01:33:02.812
LAURA: What?

01:33:02.812 --> 01:33:04.469
SAM: This is somebody else's house, maybe--

01:33:04.469 --> 01:33:06.044
LAURA: I know, but he said he was going to come

01:33:06.044 --> 01:33:07.108
because he wanted to see.

01:33:07.108 --> 01:33:08.025
SAM: Oh, okay.

01:33:10.289 --> 01:33:11.822
LAURA: Do you sleep?

01:33:17.231 --> 01:33:19.533
I'm not talking to you, Vo-kay-do.

01:33:19.533 --> 01:33:21.018
I'm talking to the Traveler.

01:33:21.018 --> 01:33:21.851
(laughter)

01:33:21.851 --> 01:33:23.751
TRAVIS: "Vo-kay-do."
LAURA: This is so weird.

01:33:23.751 --> 01:33:25.892
TRAVIS: (laughs)

01:33:26.786 --> 01:33:31.786
MATT: Okay, do you guys rest here
or do you enter with Viridian?

01:33:32.555 --> 01:33:34.114
SAM: Let's go in.
LAURA: We should go in.

01:33:34.114 --> 01:33:35.998
SAM: Yeah.
MATT: All righty.

01:33:35.998 --> 01:33:37.163
LIAM: Hold on one moment.

01:33:37.163 --> 01:33:38.609
Come here for a second.

01:33:38.609 --> 01:33:39.442
SAM: Yes, yes.

01:33:39.442 --> 01:33:41.938
LIAM: I place my hand on Veth's shoulder

01:33:41.938 --> 01:33:45.197
and just cast Enlarge

01:33:45.197 --> 01:33:47.872
and expend transmutative magic

01:33:47.872 --> 01:33:52.808
to change my stone's capabilities to fire resistance

01:33:52.808 --> 01:33:55.288
rather than constitution bumping.

01:33:55.288 --> 01:33:56.213
MATT: You got it, okay.

01:33:56.213 --> 01:33:57.187
LIAM: You are now twice your height--

01:33:57.187 --> 01:33:59.187
SAM: I'm enlarged.
LIAM: -- for a minute.

01:33:59.187 --> 01:34:01.813
MARISHA: You're my size.
SAM: Whoa, this is so cool.

01:34:01.813 --> 01:34:04.348
TRAVIS: It's a good look.
LAURA: Is Veth taller than me now?

01:34:04.348 --> 01:34:06.213
LIAM: <i>Ja.</i>
LAURA: (gasps)

01:34:06.213 --> 01:34:07.759
LIAM: For the next--
SAM: Arm wrestle.

01:34:07.759 --> 01:34:09.175
MARISHA: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:34:09.175 --> 01:34:11.053
(growling)

01:34:11.053 --> 01:34:11.976
Veth and I are going to arm wrestle.

01:34:11.976 --> 01:34:13.556
MATT: Both of you guys make strength checks for me,

01:34:13.556 --> 01:34:14.389
MARISHA: Okay.

01:34:14.389 --> 01:34:17.609
MATT: And I'll say for your size, add a d4 to it.

01:34:17.609 --> 01:34:19.647
MARISHA: My strength is garbage.

01:34:19.647 --> 01:34:21.261
LIAM: Yes, it is.

01:34:21.261 --> 01:34:22.094
MARISHA: 16.

01:34:23.002 --> 01:34:24.947
SAM: You said add a d4, right?

01:34:24.947 --> 01:34:25.888
MATT: Correct. Or, you know what?

01:34:25.888 --> 01:34:27.798
No, you'd have advantage on it I would say.

01:34:27.798 --> 01:34:29.321
LIAM: One of those ropy fists.

01:34:29.321 --> 01:34:31.846
MATT: At this size, it is a strength based thing.

01:34:31.846 --> 01:34:32.688
SAM: 18.

01:34:32.688 --> 01:34:34.280
(gasping)

01:34:34.280 --> 01:34:35.496
MATT: Straight up. It's a tense fight,

01:34:35.496 --> 01:34:37.830
but Veth takes the victory.

01:34:37.830 --> 01:34:39.222
LAURA: Holy shit.

01:34:39.222 --> 01:34:40.055
TALIESIN: That's cool.

01:34:40.055 --> 01:34:43.305
MARISHA: Look, I'm more into endurance training and stamina.

01:34:43.305 --> 01:34:44.138
So, you know.

01:34:44.138 --> 01:34:45.398
SAM: (low voice) I get it, I get it.

01:34:45.398 --> 01:34:47.561
(laughter)

01:34:47.561 --> 01:34:48.670
MARISHA: Give me a hug, though.

01:34:48.670 --> 01:34:49.684
TRAVIS: Whoa.

01:34:49.684 --> 01:34:51.116
MARISHA: Oh, yeah!

01:34:51.116 --> 01:34:54.005
MATT: Mid-hug, Veth shrinks down to normal size.

01:34:54.005 --> 01:34:55.621
SAM: Oh, okay, I'm back to --

01:34:55.621 --> 01:34:57.529
LIAM: She just hangs from Beau's arms.

01:34:57.529 --> 01:34:59.440
TRAVIS: Beefy, my gosh.
MATT: Viridian's standing there,

01:34:59.440 --> 01:35:01.458
staff leaning against the entrance of the cave,

01:35:01.458 --> 01:35:03.875
arms crossed, looking over.

01:35:03.875 --> 01:35:05.258
"You're a very strange bunch."

01:35:05.258 --> 01:35:06.258
TALIESIN: Thank you.

01:35:07.110 --> 01:35:09.546
SAM: Yeah, we can't fly, but we're okay.

01:35:09.546 --> 01:35:10.694
TRAVIS: Yeah, we appreciate you taking such--

01:35:10.694 --> 01:35:13.095
LAURA: I mean <i>they</i> can't fly, I can.
LIAM: Some of us can fly.

01:35:13.095 --> 01:35:13.928
LAURA: I can fly.

01:35:13.928 --> 01:35:15.586
LIAM: I mean, not today,
but on a different day.

01:35:15.586 --> 01:35:16.486
LAURA: I can fly today.

01:35:16.486 --> 01:35:18.355
I just didn't want to leave everyone behind.

01:35:18.355 --> 01:35:20.609
LIAM: I turned into an owl just six hours ago you saw.

01:35:20.609 --> 01:35:22.069
MATT: "I saw that, it was impressive, yeah."

01:35:22.069 --> 01:35:24.585
ASHLEY: Wait, I can't remember. Can you fly?

01:35:24.585 --> 01:35:27.127
(laughter)

01:35:28.309 --> 01:35:30.550
MATT: "I'm beginning to sense that there is a--

01:35:31.942 --> 01:35:33.350
"I may have misspoken,

01:35:33.350 --> 01:35:35.317
"and I apologize if I had been--"

01:35:35.317 --> 01:35:38.498
ASHLEY: No, I'm just giving you shit.

01:35:38.498 --> 01:35:40.935
TRAVIS: We joke with the people that we like,

01:35:40.935 --> 01:35:42.168
and we want to thank you for taking

01:35:42.168 --> 01:35:47.143
such excellent care of us. Tap on her shoulder.

01:35:47.143 --> 01:35:48.801
MATT: Okay.
TRAVIS: I'll cast Land on Hands

01:35:48.801 --> 01:35:51.957
and dump five hit points to see if I can cure a disease

01:35:51.957 --> 01:35:53.695
or neutralize poison.

01:35:53.695 --> 01:35:56.071
MATT: Okay, as you touch the shoulder,

01:35:56.071 --> 01:35:58.063
there is a small flash of divine energy

01:35:58.063 --> 01:36:00.129
and she looks back and goes,

01:36:00.129 --> 01:36:01.965
"Well, I wasn't injured,

01:36:01.965 --> 01:36:03.015
"but thank you.

01:36:03.015 --> 01:36:04.517
"I appreciate you looking out."

01:36:04.517 --> 01:36:06.590
TRAVIS: Just a thank you.

01:36:06.590 --> 01:36:08.182
MARISHA: (laughs)

01:36:08.182 --> 01:36:11.192
SAM: Maybe you had to touch her boob?

01:36:11.192 --> 01:36:13.206
TRAVIS: I'm not touching any boobs.

01:36:13.206 --> 01:36:14.039
SAM: Just saying.

01:36:14.039 --> 01:36:15.701
LAURA: How are you feeling?

01:36:15.701 --> 01:36:17.887
How do you feel now?
How do you feel now?

01:36:17.887 --> 01:36:19.754
You feel okay?
MATT: "I feel fine."

01:36:19.754 --> 01:36:20.951
LAURA: Okay, just checking.

01:36:20.951 --> 01:36:22.871
TRAVIS: Jester felt so bad
after we went through the mosquitoes

01:36:22.871 --> 01:36:23.896
and the insects--

01:36:23.896 --> 01:36:26.463
SAM: Where were you from again originally?

01:36:28.574 --> 01:36:29.819
MATT: "I don't recall."

01:36:29.819 --> 01:36:31.682
LAURA: How long have you been a druid?
TRAVIS: Damn, fucking balls, they forget!

01:36:31.682 --> 01:36:34.215
LAURA: Are you an arch fey?
How long have you been a druid?

01:36:34.215 --> 01:36:36.387
How long have you known how to shape foliage?

01:36:36.387 --> 01:36:38.907
MATT: "Since I've been here."

01:36:38.907 --> 01:36:41.995
LIAM: Do you remember what the
place was like that you are from.

01:36:41.995 --> 01:36:43.392
Maybe you don't remember names,

01:36:43.392 --> 01:36:45.258
but do you remember was it a cold place

01:36:45.258 --> 01:36:49.038
or perhaps a dry climate?

01:36:49.038 --> 01:36:51.064
MATT: "No."
LIAM: Urban?

01:36:51.064 --> 01:36:52.405
Rustic?

01:36:52.405 --> 01:36:53.931
TALIESIN: How intense are we to actually solve

01:36:53.931 --> 01:36:55.120
this particular riddle before we go inside.

01:36:55.120 --> 01:36:58.968
MATT: "If you're worried about any sort of toxins,

01:36:58.968 --> 01:37:02.443
"as part of my druidic practice,

01:37:03.792 --> 01:37:06.507
"poisons don't seem to take heed in my body."

01:37:06.507 --> 01:37:10.215
TRAVIS: Oh, shit, right.
LAURA: Oh, that's why the bugs don't bother you.

01:37:10.215 --> 01:37:14.339
TRAVIS: Not that much, I don't think, not yet.

01:37:14.339 --> 01:37:16.429
We'll see, I may regret this.

01:37:16.429 --> 01:37:19.229
MATT: "Regardless, shall we?"
TRAVIS: Yes.

01:37:19.229 --> 01:37:22.443
MATT: All right, the same marching order,

01:37:22.443 --> 01:37:24.635
or are you switching it up a bit?

01:37:26.325 --> 01:37:28.630
LIAM: I cannot see the order.
I'm so far away.

01:37:28.630 --> 01:37:30.501
MATT: We have Viridian in the front with Caduceus,

01:37:30.501 --> 01:37:34.132
then we have Beau and Yasha, then we have Caleb, Jester,

01:37:34.132 --> 01:37:35.981
and then Fjord and Veth.

01:37:35.981 --> 01:37:37.287
SAM: We're going into lava area.

01:37:37.287 --> 01:37:40.887
Anyone fire resistant or fire-- you are?

01:37:40.887 --> 01:37:42.236
MATT: He is now with the stone.
LIAM: I am now.

01:37:42.236 --> 01:37:43.598
SAM: Okay, yeah, maybe you should go up front.

01:37:43.598 --> 01:37:45.396
LAURA: Yeah, but he's still super weak, though.

01:37:45.396 --> 01:37:48.114
MARISHA: Yeah, I don't know if I'd put you up front.

01:37:48.114 --> 01:37:50.709
LAURA: I mean, you're super, like, strong--

01:37:50.709 --> 01:37:52.586
MARISHA: Yeah, you're valuable.

01:37:52.586 --> 01:37:55.909
TALIESIN: I'd rather the fire resistance be a last--

01:37:55.909 --> 01:37:57.488
MARISHA: Just stay in the middle.

01:37:57.488 --> 01:37:58.321
LIAM: (sniffs)
TALIESIN: You're not a shield.

01:37:58.321 --> 01:37:59.312
LAURA: I'm just saying your arms

01:37:59.312 --> 01:38:01.546
are really, really scrawny.
LIAM: You smell like crayons.

01:38:02.491 --> 01:38:04.389
ASHLEY: Yeah, sometimes I do.

01:38:04.389 --> 01:38:05.822
TRAVIS: Crayons?

01:38:07.779 --> 01:38:09.015
LIAM: Tickles my nose.

01:38:09.015 --> 01:38:12.622
TRAVIS: Is that a Zemnian thing, crayons?

01:38:12.622 --> 01:38:15.719
MATT: So are we good with this order?
TRAVIS: Yes, we're good, we're good.

01:38:15.719 --> 01:38:17.510
TALIESIN: Yes, apologize.

01:38:17.510 --> 01:38:20.703
MATT: All right. So stepping within the entrance

01:38:20.703 --> 01:38:23.020
to the interior cavern at the base

01:38:23.020 --> 01:38:25.773
of Rumblecusp mountain proper,

01:38:25.773 --> 01:38:29.431
the black, porous rock that surrounds you is rough

01:38:29.431 --> 01:38:31.207
to the touch for any that are skirting

01:38:31.207 --> 01:38:34.663
along the sides of it, crumbly but still, at times,

01:38:34.663 --> 01:38:37.722
sharp and catching the finger in a way that hurts.

01:38:37.722 --> 01:38:40.909
The air is dry and definitely warmer

01:38:40.909 --> 01:38:44.545
once you've stepped fully within the tunnel itself.

01:38:44.545 --> 01:38:48.143
Your nostrils sting slightly with a ripe, aromatic mixture

01:38:48.143 --> 01:38:53.143
of vitriolic scents that seem to be coming with this wind.

01:38:53.332 --> 01:38:56.706
It is lightless beyond the sources you have,

01:38:56.706 --> 01:39:01.675
and you plunge further down the steady decline

01:39:01.675 --> 01:39:03.979
of the winding tunnel deeper into the mountain.

01:39:03.979 --> 01:39:05.262
TRAVIS: Shit.
MARISHA: We're going down.

01:39:05.262 --> 01:39:06.345
MATT: And that's where we're taking a break.

01:39:06.345 --> 01:39:09.344
(grumbling)

01:39:09.344 --> 01:39:11.570
ASHLEY: I just want to keep playing forever.

01:39:11.570 --> 01:39:13.307
MATT: I know, well, let's take a break,
and we can come back.

01:39:13.307 --> 01:39:16.047
There's another part of the story, don't worry.

01:39:16.047 --> 01:39:19.715
We'll be back here in a few minutes while we take a break.

01:39:19.715 --> 01:39:20.648
We'll see you guys here shortly.

01:39:20.648 --> 01:39:21.648
LIAM: Yay!
TRAVIS: Yay!

01:39:23.871 --> 01:39:25.067

Well, this is actually where the headbutts come in.

And then they headbutt.

01:40:15.953 --> 01:40:17.886
And they headbutt, and they headbutt,

01:40:17.886 --> 01:40:19.102
and they headbutt again!

01:40:19.102 --> 01:40:20.938
And they headbutt. (growls)

01:40:20.938 --> 01:40:23.028
And I've got to admit, I don't remember

01:40:23.028 --> 01:40:25.654
anything else that happened at all.

01:40:25.654 --> 01:40:28.154
(light music)

01:40:42.808 --> 01:40:44.828
Hey, Critters, Laura Bailey here.

01:40:44.828 --> 01:40:47.241
Let's see what's up in the Critical Role shop.

01:40:49.128 --> 01:40:53.721
It's perfect for the home or the office, or your bathroom.

01:40:55.068 --> 01:40:59.061
Ooh, look at this, look at the details, ooh.

01:41:00.518 --> 01:41:02.430
Darling, I'd recommend buying two,

01:41:02.430 --> 01:41:07.151
one for you and another for you, let's be honest.

01:41:08.608 --> 01:41:11.135
It's so cute, I can't handle it.

01:41:11.135 --> 01:41:12.728
(cat meows)

01:41:12.728 --> 01:41:14.678
This is a lot of stuff, you guys,

01:41:14.678 --> 01:41:17.861
we have like so many cool things right now.

01:41:19.041 --> 01:41:23.351
All this and more, now available in the Critical Role shop.

01:41:27.584 --> 01:41:30.334
(cheerful music)

01:41:38.131 --> 01:41:39.594
We're here talking about rap battles

01:41:39.594 --> 01:41:40.478
because this next critter hug goes out

01:41:40.478 --> 01:41:42.868
to the Hollabacknerds and their insane

01:41:42.868 --> 01:41:44.738
Critical Role rap battle video.

01:41:44.738 --> 01:41:47.738
Yes, that sentence is correct, you heard me.

01:41:47.738 --> 01:41:50.888
They are a trio of nerds from multiple corners of the world,

01:41:50.888 --> 01:41:54.538
Kieren Berling, Gemma Mercott, AKA Nerd By Night Cosplay,

01:41:54.538 --> 01:41:55.968
and Danny Durato.

01:41:55.968 --> 01:41:58.368
Everything from the writing, the vocals, the costume,

01:41:58.368 --> 01:42:01.868
the makeup, the production, the editing, all done by them.

01:42:01.868 --> 01:42:04.968
Their most recent video is Yasha versus Beauregard.

01:42:04.968 --> 01:42:07.808
Once again, that's right, ya heard me,

That was the greatest thing I've ever seen.

01:43:04.966 --> 01:43:06.488
It's so good.
That was so good!

01:43:06.488 --> 01:43:09.688
And not just the fact that they wrote

01:43:09.688 --> 01:43:12.808
a Critical Role themed rap, but the cosplay was amazing!

01:43:12.808 --> 01:43:15.558
It's every facet of it is done to such a level of quality

01:43:15.558 --> 01:43:18.598
that it's extremely humbling and amazing

01:43:18.598 --> 01:43:21.699
from our standpoint, doing this show,

01:43:21.699 --> 01:43:24.208
and just another example of how many talented artists

01:43:24.208 --> 01:43:25.418
are out there doing cool shit.

01:43:25.418 --> 01:43:28.338 line:20%
Go subscribe to the Hollabacknerds on YouTube,

01:43:28.338 --> 01:43:30.108 line:20%
because they do some really fun stuff,

01:43:30.108 --> 01:43:32.388 line:20%
and Kieren and Danny have another YouTube band

01:43:32.388 --> 01:43:34.298 line:20%
called Cat, Hat, Fiddle, and Friends,

01:43:34.298 --> 01:43:37.538 line:20%
and you can follow Gemma's cosplay @Nerdbynight on Twitter.

01:43:37.538 --> 01:43:40.088 line:20%
A lot of people I know who are extremely talented at this.

01:43:40.088 --> 01:43:41.568
I am not one of 'em.

01:43:41.568 --> 01:43:43.798
I trip over my words constantly,

01:43:43.798 --> 01:43:46.408
which is a shame because words are like my job.

01:43:46.408 --> 01:43:48.027
Hey, same.
Right?!

01:43:48.027 --> 01:43:48.938
I feel ya, right there.

01:43:48.938 --> 01:43:51.768 line:20%
So I'm like, I can't form sentence,

01:43:51.768 --> 01:43:54.298 line:20%
see, it's happening right now, which is why...

01:43:54.298 --> 01:43:56.028
Who would you want to see next in a rap battle?

01:43:56.028 --> 01:43:59.448
I would want to see campaign one versus campaign two,

01:43:59.448 --> 01:44:01.358
like themselves.
Oh shit.

01:44:01.358 --> 01:44:02.498
Yeah, right?

01:44:02.498 --> 01:44:03.550
That's actually pretty cool.

01:44:03.550 --> 01:44:04.383
Wouldn't that be pretty cool?

01:44:04.383 --> 01:44:07.088
Like Keyla vs Beau, like a rap battle?

01:44:07.088 --> 01:44:08.098
That's what I'd want to see.

01:44:08.098 --> 01:44:09.228
That'd be pretty rad.

01:44:09.228 --> 01:44:12.548
I'd like to see a throwdown between guest characters.

01:44:12.548 --> 01:44:13.578
Oh god.

01:44:13.578 --> 01:44:15.808
We're talking like if we want to bring in

01:44:15.808 --> 01:44:19.037
Keg versus Reani in a full-on throwdown.

01:44:19.037 --> 01:44:22.068
That would get really personal, really fast,

01:44:22.068 --> 01:44:24.728
and it would just be about sleeping with Beau.

01:44:24.728 --> 01:44:25.850
Yeah.

01:44:25.850 --> 01:44:26.933
You know what, that's exactly what-

01:44:26.933 --> 01:44:27.766
That's kinda why I'm down here for this.

01:44:27.766 --> 01:44:28.638
That's why I want it.

01:44:28.638 --> 01:44:29.778
Marisha, you over there?

01:44:29.778 --> 01:44:30.611
Are you ready?

01:44:31.673 --> 01:44:34.423
(cheerful music)

01:44:46.885 --> 01:44:49.179
(Pumat grunting)

01:44:49.179 --> 01:44:50.428
(Pumat chuckles)

01:44:50.428 --> 01:44:51.758
Would you look at that?

01:44:51.758 --> 01:44:53.138
I think it worked.

01:44:53.138 --> 01:44:55.447
You were right, Pumat number three.

01:44:55.447 --> 01:44:58.147
All we had to do was invoke that subscription cantrip.

01:44:59.748 --> 01:45:00.698
Pumat number three?

01:45:03.658 --> 01:45:04.688
Oh boy.

01:45:04.688 --> 01:45:05.988
Well, hello there.

01:45:05.988 --> 01:45:07.438
I'm Pumat Prime.

01:45:07.438 --> 01:45:11.508
It's good to finally join you here in the prime dimension.

01:45:11.508 --> 01:45:15.488
I see this as the Twitch Prime realm, I think,

01:45:15.488 --> 01:45:19.928
and oh, we're on the Critical Role channel, aren't we?

01:45:19.928 --> 01:45:23.271
Well, would you look at that, you got chat and everything.

01:45:23.271 --> 01:45:24.104
(Pumat chuckles)

01:45:24.104 --> 01:45:27.408
Respectfully, I was looking for the prime rib realm,

01:45:27.408 --> 01:45:30.078
but this isn't too bad.

01:45:30.078 --> 01:45:32.328
You see, if you already have access

01:45:32.328 --> 01:45:35.418
to the Amazon Prime realm, you can get a free subscription

01:45:35.418 --> 01:45:38.248
to the channel of your choice in the Twitch Prime realm.

01:45:38.248 --> 01:45:41.068
The two realms have a pretty good working relationship

01:45:41.068 --> 01:45:43.258
after that peace treaty the prime minister

01:45:43.258 --> 01:45:45.158
signed a few years back.

01:45:45.158 --> 01:45:47.228
You just have to remember to renew

01:45:47.228 --> 01:45:50.038
your Twitch Prime subscription at the top of each month,

01:45:50.038 --> 01:45:50.938
respectfully.

01:45:50.938 --> 01:45:53.978
And hey, if you're already a subscriber,

01:45:53.978 --> 01:45:56.518
you can spread the joy by gifting a subscription

01:45:56.518 --> 01:45:59.258
using the Gift a Sub button.

01:45:59.258 --> 01:46:02.338
That is, assuming the Empire hasn't sent a tax man

01:46:02.338 --> 01:46:05.481
to your shop here recently. (chuckling)

01:46:06.368 --> 01:46:08.928
All right, well, off to find that darn elusive

01:46:08.928 --> 01:46:10.068
prime rib realm.

01:46:10.068 --> 01:46:12.581
Who knew the prime dimension had so many pockets?

01:46:13.828 --> 01:46:16.271
Good luck. (chuckles)

01:46:17.788 --> 01:46:18.788
Pumat three?

01:46:21.984 --> 01:46:23.901
Subscribe.

01:46:25.468 --> 01:46:26.901
Re-subscribe.

01:46:28.708 --> 01:46:32.211
Brian Foster is not a cabbage.

01:59:23.957 --> 01:59:25.047
MATT: And welcome back.

01:59:25.047 --> 01:59:27.639
So, Mighty Nein.

01:59:28.614 --> 01:59:31.205
As you step into the dark interior

01:59:31.205 --> 01:59:35.126
of the central volcanic mountain of Rumblecrusp,

01:59:35.126 --> 01:59:38.909
Viridian leads you deeper in, saying-- what?

01:59:40.147 --> 01:59:42.147
SAM: Saying what?
LAURA: What?

01:59:42.147 --> 01:59:43.590
MATT: I don't know.
LAURA: She said what?

01:59:43.590 --> 01:59:44.870
SAM: What?

01:59:44.870 --> 01:59:46.981
MATT: Don't make fun of my speech hiccups.

01:59:46.981 --> 01:59:49.137
MARISHA: Sorry, I just liked "Rumblecrusp."

01:59:49.137 --> 01:59:49.970
MATT: Rumblecrusp was good.

01:59:49.970 --> 01:59:52.243
TRAVIS: I heard it too, but I wasn't sure.

01:59:52.243 --> 01:59:53.667
MATT: Occasionally the brain gets mixed up

01:59:53.667 --> 01:59:54.917
and my impediment kicks in. My apologies.

01:59:54.917 --> 01:59:56.478
MARISHA: It sounds delicious.
ASHLEY: The Rumblecrusp--

01:59:56.478 --> 01:59:57.892
MARISHA: I want a Rumblecrusp right now.

01:59:57.892 --> 01:59:59.069
MATT: (laughs)
TALIESIN: God, I would kill for it.

01:59:59.069 --> 02:00:01.338
SAM: Oh, blueberry Rumblecrusp.

02:00:01.338 --> 02:00:02.681
Every detail's important, Matt.

02:00:02.681 --> 02:00:04.055
We want to make sure we're not missing it.

02:00:04.055 --> 02:00:05.757
ASHLEY: Rumblecrusp crumble.
MARISHA: New, from Slayer's Cake.

02:00:05.757 --> 02:00:07.169
MATT: Just adding some more hit points to the next battle.

02:00:07.169 --> 02:00:08.463
TRAVIS: No!
LAURA: No!

02:00:08.463 --> 02:00:10.616
(laughter)

02:00:10.616 --> 02:00:13.699
MATT: Pressing inward, Viridian does say,

02:00:14.637 --> 02:00:18.970
"These tunnels can be a bit
confusing the further in we go,

02:00:18.970 --> 02:00:21.645
"but the waters are safe.

02:00:23.148 --> 02:00:24.844
"They're breathable, actually.

02:00:24.844 --> 02:00:29.395
"The fire god is welcoming and keeps the various tunnels

02:00:29.395 --> 02:00:33.185
"and elements of water within his mountain abode

02:00:33.185 --> 02:00:34.790
"welcoming as well."

02:00:34.790 --> 02:00:37.380
TRAVIS and SAM: The water is breathable?

02:00:37.380 --> 02:00:38.348
MATT: "Indeed."

02:00:38.348 --> 02:00:41.382
TRAVIS: As in you can submerge yourself in liquid water

02:00:41.382 --> 02:00:43.165
and breathe?

02:00:43.165 --> 02:00:44.297
MATT: "Yes."
SAM: No, thanks.

02:00:44.297 --> 02:00:46.799
TALIESIN: You seem very surprised
considering we've done that before.

02:00:46.799 --> 02:00:47.890
TRAVIS: With magic.

02:00:47.890 --> 02:00:51.681
TALIESIN: I mean, I think this is magic water.
LAURA: Well, I bet this is magic here, too.

02:00:53.881 --> 02:00:56.839
TRAVIS: Wonderful, lead on.

02:00:56.839 --> 02:00:59.247
MATT: "I do warn, though,
the air grows heavier and toxic

02:00:59.247 --> 02:01:01.469
"as we travel deeper in.

02:01:01.469 --> 02:01:04.646
"Best to make haste to the water as soon as we can,"

02:01:04.646 --> 02:01:07.269
and she begins to pick up her pace a bit.

02:01:07.269 --> 02:01:09.165
LAURA: Everybody brought their masks, right?

02:01:09.165 --> 02:01:10.065
MARISHA: Yeah.

02:01:10.065 --> 02:01:11.148
LAURA: Okay, good.

02:01:12.247 --> 02:01:16.200
MATT: As you continue down the slowly winding decline

02:01:16.200 --> 02:01:19.095
of this pathway, this tunnel that goes deeper

02:01:19.095 --> 02:01:21.248
and further beneath the mountain,

02:01:21.248 --> 02:01:23.231
that acrid taste in your mouth

02:01:23.231 --> 02:01:26.456
as the various chemical gases

02:01:26.456 --> 02:01:29.520
that mix with the air and the warm wind that's blowing

02:01:29.520 --> 02:01:31.185
through this tunnel past you as you go.

02:01:31.185 --> 02:01:33.276
You can taste that

02:01:33.276 --> 02:01:36.709
very chemical, metallic-type flavor,

02:01:36.709 --> 02:01:39.089
and the air itself does become heavier

02:01:39.089 --> 02:01:40.919
and heavier as you go.

02:01:40.919 --> 02:01:44.695
LAURA: I get out my mom's perfume, my lavender oil,

02:01:44.695 --> 02:01:47.255
and I put a little bit on a piece of cloth

02:01:47.255 --> 02:01:49.141
and hold it in front of my nose.

02:01:49.141 --> 02:01:50.954
MATT: Okay.
TRAVIS: Essential oils.

02:01:50.954 --> 02:01:53.705
MARISHA: It's the same kind of irony, acrid smell

02:01:53.705 --> 02:01:57.372
that I smelled before earlier in the forest?

02:01:58.929 --> 02:02:02.362
MATT: Similar in some ways in
the fact that there are a lot of...

02:02:05.420 --> 02:02:09.422
mineral elements that are not common towards the surface,

02:02:09.422 --> 02:02:11.672
but it is a different type.

02:02:12.532 --> 02:02:17.532
The air is getting heavier and
Viridian says at a certain point,

02:02:17.575 --> 02:02:20.325
"While the toxins don't affect me,

02:02:21.515 --> 02:02:24.652
"perhaps try your best to hold your breath."

02:02:24.652 --> 02:02:26.889
TRAVIS: (inhales)

02:02:26.889 --> 02:02:28.158
MATT: Do you all take a deep breath?

02:02:28.158 --> 02:02:29.649
TRAVIS: Yeah.
MATT: Okay.

02:02:29.649 --> 02:02:32.652
LAURA: I don't take a deep breath, I just hold it.

02:02:32.652 --> 02:02:36.310
MARISHA: (laughs)
MATT: Okay, you got it.

02:02:36.310 --> 02:02:37.360
LAURA: I didn't want to take a deep breath

02:02:37.360 --> 02:02:39.779
because there's already toxins in the air.

02:02:39.779 --> 02:02:41.975
MATT: True.
MARISHA: That's a good point, yeah.

02:02:41.975 --> 02:02:44.646
MATT: So all of you beginning to push forward.

02:02:44.646 --> 02:02:48.366
Those of you who took a breath, you can hold your breath

02:02:48.366 --> 02:02:50.168
for a number of minutes equal to one

02:02:50.168 --> 02:02:52.873
plus your constitution modifier.

02:02:52.873 --> 02:02:53.944
TRAVIS: Okay.
LIAM: Oh boy.

02:02:53.944 --> 02:02:56.298
MATT: So what is that for you?

02:02:56.298 --> 02:02:59.405
TRAVIS: For me, that is-- the modifier?

02:02:59.405 --> 02:03:00.909
MATT: Yes.
TRAVIS: So five.

02:03:00.909 --> 02:03:02.736
MATT: Okay, so, five minutes you can hold your breath.

02:03:02.736 --> 02:03:04.319
TRAVIS: Okay.

02:03:04.319 --> 02:03:05.782
LAURA: You, because you didn't take a deep breath,

02:03:05.782 --> 02:03:07.072
you lose the one base.

02:03:07.072 --> 02:03:09.340
So, what's your constitution modifier?

02:03:09.340 --> 02:03:10.365
LAURA: Oh.

02:03:13.748 --> 02:03:14.581
Three.

02:03:14.581 --> 02:03:16.488
MATT: Three, so, you can hold
your breath for three minutes.

02:03:16.488 --> 02:03:18.154
LIAM: Total of three.
MATT: Three.

02:03:18.154 --> 02:03:19.779
SAM: Two total.
MATT: Two minutes.

02:03:19.779 --> 02:03:20.898
ASHLEY: Eight minutes.

02:03:20.898 --> 02:03:24.215
LAURA: Holy--
TRAVIS: Fuck, let's go, fam.

02:03:24.215 --> 02:03:26.190
ASHLEY: What?
SAM: She's got a third lung.

02:03:26.190 --> 02:03:27.844
ASHLEY: My constitution is a plus seven.

02:03:27.844 --> 02:03:29.510
LIAM: That can come in handy.
MATT: Your saving throw is plus seven,

02:03:29.510 --> 02:03:30.477
but just the modifier.

02:03:30.477 --> 02:03:31.310
ASHLEY: Fuck.

02:03:31.310 --> 02:03:34.329
(laughter)

02:03:34.329 --> 02:03:35.980
MATT: It's all good.

02:03:35.980 --> 02:03:39.854
ASHLEY: I'm all cocky about it.
TRAVIS: 12 minutes.

02:03:39.854 --> 02:03:43.269
LIAM: She gets down starts doing
one-handed push-ups with her mouth closed.

02:03:43.269 --> 02:03:44.953
ASHLEY: Three.
MATT: There you go, three minutes.

02:03:44.953 --> 02:03:46.334
ASHLEY: That makes more sense.

02:03:46.334 --> 02:03:48.265
MATT: Plus the one?

02:03:48.265 --> 02:03:49.220
ASHLEY: Three.

02:03:49.220 --> 02:03:50.916
MATT: Okay, Caduceus.

02:03:50.916 --> 02:03:52.937
TALIESIN: Four.
MATT: All right, and Beauregard?

02:03:52.937 --> 02:03:53.853
MARISHA: Four, yeah.

02:03:53.853 --> 02:03:55.355
MATT: All right.

02:03:55.355 --> 02:03:57.549
So, with the breaths that you have held,

02:03:57.549 --> 02:04:00.356
you continue down this pathway as Viridian is leading.

02:04:02.147 --> 02:04:05.232
The floor itself is rocky and jagged,

02:04:05.232 --> 02:04:08.182
and as you are rushing, you
can see the topography itself

02:04:08.182 --> 02:04:10.865
drop at times, and your boots catch

02:04:10.865 --> 02:04:12.065
and in some cases,

02:04:12.065 --> 02:04:16.314
split or cut against the obsidian flakes

02:04:16.314 --> 02:04:19.992
and edges of the sharpened broken rock.

02:04:19.992 --> 02:04:22.086
And pushing as fast as you can,

02:04:22.086 --> 02:04:22.919
if everyone could go ahead

02:04:22.919 --> 02:04:24.768
and make a dexterity saving throw for me.

02:04:24.768 --> 02:04:25.971
TRAVIS: Oh shit.

02:04:25.971 --> 02:04:27.425
MARISHA: Save?

02:04:27.425 --> 02:04:29.186
MATT: Yes, to move quickly through here,

02:04:29.186 --> 02:04:33.086
but without tripping or

02:04:33.086 --> 02:04:36.579
stumbling your way down the decline.
LAURA: Using too much of your held air either.

02:04:36.579 --> 02:04:37.637
TRAVIS: 10.

02:04:37.637 --> 02:04:39.428
MATT: 10, got it.

02:04:39.428 --> 02:04:42.113
LAURA: ♪ N-n-n-n-nineteen ♪
MATT: Nice.

02:04:42.113 --> 02:04:45.026
LIAM: I failed, but I will use
my ring of evasion to succeed.

02:04:45.026 --> 02:04:46.050
MATT: You got it.

02:04:46.050 --> 02:04:47.558
SAM: 29.
MATT: All right.

02:04:47.558 --> 02:04:49.149
ASHLEY: 20.

02:04:49.149 --> 02:04:50.671
TALIESIN: 11.

02:04:50.671 --> 02:04:52.425
MARISHA: 11, I rolled a two.

02:04:52.425 --> 02:04:53.258
SAM: Oof.

02:04:53.258 --> 02:04:58.015
MATT: Okay, Caduceus, Beauregard, and Fjord.

02:04:58.015 --> 02:05:01.120
As you guys are all rushing and following Viridian,

02:05:01.120 --> 02:05:04.799
Fjord, you turn one corner and
your knee slams into the edge

02:05:04.799 --> 02:05:05.642
of a sharpened blade.

02:05:05.642 --> 02:05:07.340
It cuts through.

02:05:07.340 --> 02:05:09.858
It doesn't do damage as you pulled back just in time.

02:05:09.858 --> 02:05:12.084
You feel the impact, and it would have done some damage,

02:05:12.084 --> 02:05:14.925
but in doing so, the back foot hits a crumpled part

02:05:14.925 --> 02:05:16.287
of a ledge and you fall back.

02:05:16.287 --> 02:05:18.440
(crunches) Hit the ground as you do.

02:05:18.440 --> 02:05:20.920
(gasps) The air escapes.

02:05:20.920 --> 02:05:23.643
You do lose two minutes of breath.

02:05:23.643 --> 02:05:25.868
MARISHA: Oh shit.

02:05:25.868 --> 02:05:27.546
TRAVIS: I'm down with you normies at three.

02:05:27.546 --> 02:05:28.596
MATT: All right.

02:05:28.596 --> 02:05:32.862
Caduceus, as you see Fjord hit the ground,

02:05:32.862 --> 02:05:36.918
you slowly climb down the edge and move ahead,

02:05:36.918 --> 02:05:40.384
and as you do, you hit a small--

02:05:41.693 --> 02:05:45.728
it's like a slick patch of condensation on the ground.

02:05:45.728 --> 02:05:48.333
You skid for a moment and you catch yourself,

02:05:48.333 --> 02:05:52.502
and as you sit up, you realize, as you were keeping low

02:05:52.502 --> 02:05:53.872
and skidding, that this portion of the ceiling

02:05:53.872 --> 02:05:55.696
is a bit lower than expected and you (bumps) hit your head.

02:05:55.696 --> 02:05:58.542
TALIESIN: I'm fine, everybody, I'm--

02:05:58.542 --> 02:06:00.536
MATT: You lose two minutes of breath.

02:06:00.536 --> 02:06:02.377
TRAVIS: Oh, wow.

02:06:02.377 --> 02:06:03.998
MATT: Beauregard, you see this happen

02:06:03.998 --> 02:06:05.627
to Caduceus and instinctually laugh

02:06:05.627 --> 02:06:07.487
and lose two minutes of breath.
MARISHA: (laughs)

02:06:07.487 --> 02:06:10.469
(laughter)

02:06:10.469 --> 02:06:11.621
TRAVIS: Amazing.

02:06:11.621 --> 02:06:13.043
LIAM: That's just right.

02:06:13.043 --> 02:06:13.876
TRAVIS: So, I'm at three--

02:06:13.876 --> 02:06:16.992
ASHLEY: That was just right.
TRAVIS: You're at two, and you're at one?

02:06:19.868 --> 02:06:22.975
MATT: It is a three minute journey.

02:06:22.975 --> 02:06:26.393
So those of you who are at two minutes or lower,

02:06:26.393 --> 02:06:28.319
I need you to make a constitution saving throw.

02:06:28.319 --> 02:06:33.188
TALIESIN: I'm also going to give myself a little Resistance

02:06:33.188 --> 02:06:34.474
before I breathe in.

02:06:34.474 --> 02:06:36.910
MATT: Okay, Resistance of?

02:06:36.910 --> 02:06:38.449
TALIESIN: Constitution?

02:06:38.449 --> 02:06:39.915
MATT: Okay, add your--
TALIESIN: Yeah, just a--

02:06:39.915 --> 02:06:40.944
MARISHA: Con save?

02:06:40.944 --> 02:06:42.440
MATT: Con save, so, that is?

02:06:42.440 --> 02:06:45.186
MARISHA: 20 total.
MATT: 20 total, great.

02:06:45.186 --> 02:06:46.836
TALIESIN: (sighs)

02:06:50.663 --> 02:06:51.919
10.

02:06:51.919 --> 02:06:53.809
MATT: Got it, and you, Veth?

02:06:53.809 --> 02:06:57.035
SAM: A 17, I breathe through my clothes.

02:06:57.035 --> 02:06:59.320
MATT: Okay, you just barely make it.

02:06:59.320 --> 02:07:03.103
In trying to breathe in as you need to,

02:07:03.103 --> 02:07:05.768
the lungs are burning and you find yourself instinctually,

02:07:05.768 --> 02:07:07.189
to survive, breathing in.

02:07:07.189 --> 02:07:09.240
It stings and burns the inside of your throat

02:07:09.240 --> 02:07:10.448
and your lungs.

02:07:10.448 --> 02:07:12.989
The temperature itself is hot enough in this space,

02:07:12.989 --> 02:07:16.800
but the toxins that now swim in the invisible air around you

02:07:16.800 --> 02:07:19.908
just burn horribly.

02:07:20.788 --> 02:07:23.899
You manage to shrug off the majority of the pain.

02:07:23.899 --> 02:07:26.729
You all rolled above a 17?

02:07:26.729 --> 02:07:29.895
LAURA: Hmm. Mm-mm. He rolled a 10.
MATT: No, you rolled a 10, right, yeah.

02:07:29.895 --> 02:07:32.000
The two of you manage to inhale

02:07:32.000 --> 02:07:33.610
and it burns, but you push forward.

02:07:33.610 --> 02:07:38.064
Caduceus, it seizes the inside of your chest for a moment,

02:07:38.064 --> 02:07:43.064
and you find yourself poisoned for the next 24 hours.

02:07:43.112 --> 02:07:47.377
LAURA: Oh no. I notice Sprinkle's
looking a little uncomfortable.

02:07:47.377 --> 02:07:49.939
(laughter)

02:07:49.939 --> 02:07:52.979
I'm going to hold up my lavender cloth to his nose, too.

02:07:52.979 --> 02:07:55.887
MATT: Roll a very, very tiny
constitution saving throw for me,

02:07:55.887 --> 02:07:56.853
if you don't mind.
LAURA: Do I just roll

02:07:56.853 --> 02:07:58.824
that with a d4?

02:07:58.824 --> 02:08:01.235
MATT: Roll a d12 or d20,

02:08:01.235 --> 02:08:02.504
TRAVIS: (like Sprinkle) (panting)

02:08:02.504 --> 02:08:03.925
MATT: Just a straight roll.

02:08:03.925 --> 02:08:05.083
LIAM: (like Sprinkle) (gasps)

02:08:05.083 --> 02:08:06.295
LAURA: 17.

02:08:06.295 --> 02:08:08.011
MATT: But yet, the toughest--

02:08:08.011 --> 02:08:10.777
This guy, who's survived

02:08:10.777 --> 02:08:13.366
and endured so much,

02:08:13.366 --> 02:08:17.552
this spindly little creature of nature who has been blessed

02:08:17.552 --> 02:08:19.120
by the Wild Mother, it seems,

02:08:19.120 --> 02:08:23.275
much like two of your compatriots, is (tiny hacking),

02:08:23.275 --> 02:08:27.467
but manages to shrug off the toxic effects of the air.

02:08:27.467 --> 02:08:29.534
LIAM: (like Sprinkle) I am my scars.

02:08:29.534 --> 02:08:31.898
(laughter)

02:08:31.898 --> 02:08:32.731
TRAVIS: (like Sprinkle) Why?

02:08:35.385 --> 02:08:38.728
MATT: The air is growing more humid

02:08:38.728 --> 02:08:42.171
as the dryness of it begins to fade.

02:08:42.171 --> 02:08:45.880
As you curve around, the moisture in the air grows thicker,

02:08:45.880 --> 02:08:47.371
and you begin to see a

02:08:47.371 --> 02:08:51.395
faint, orange glow around the bend.

02:08:51.395 --> 02:08:52.844
MARISHA: Oh shit.

02:08:52.844 --> 02:08:54.826
MATT: As you curve around the tunnel,

02:08:54.826 --> 02:08:59.640
you begin to see small orange and red plants growing all

02:08:59.640 --> 02:09:03.485
along the floor and walls and ceiling emitting a faint glow

02:09:03.485 --> 02:09:05.801
of the same color.

02:09:05.801 --> 02:09:08.740
They have a flowered seaweed-type look to them,

02:09:08.740 --> 02:09:11.489
a rubbery texture, and you can see, now,

02:09:11.489 --> 02:09:15.383
the interior volcanic rock that encompasses this tunnel is,

02:09:15.383 --> 02:09:18.383
in itself, glistening with moisture.

02:09:19.917 --> 02:09:22.067
The plants, themselves, are well embedded

02:09:22.067 --> 02:09:26.321
within the various nooks and crannies of the volcanic rock,

02:09:26.321 --> 02:09:28.392
and you can see, occasionally every few seconds, droplets

02:09:28.392 --> 02:09:31.858
(plops) of condensation splashing

02:09:31.858 --> 02:09:32.883
in the path ahead.
LAURA: Does the water feel

02:09:32.883 --> 02:09:34.795
hot if it lands on us?

02:09:34.795 --> 02:09:36.411
MATT: Do you want to go underneath the water?

02:09:36.411 --> 02:09:38.253
LAURA: Oh, I just thought the condensation falling

02:09:38.253 --> 02:09:39.885
was going to fall on us sometimes.

02:09:39.885 --> 02:09:44.414
MATT: Sure, and it does, and it doesn't burn through you.

02:09:44.414 --> 02:09:47.642
It's not acid, but the temperature in here

02:09:47.642 --> 02:09:49.992
is very, very, uncomfortably hot.

02:09:51.397 --> 02:09:54.507
The tunnel slopes to an end, finally,

02:09:54.507 --> 02:09:56.323
and the floor itself is now being taken

02:09:56.323 --> 02:09:59.321
with a liquid surface.

02:09:59.321 --> 02:10:02.504
A pool of faintly steaming water,

02:10:02.504 --> 02:10:04.867
roughly 30 feet across,

02:10:04.867 --> 02:10:06.866
and the ceiling slopes and ends

02:10:06.866 --> 02:10:09.600
at the other edge of this pool.

02:10:09.600 --> 02:10:13.367
Beneath the water, you can see a faint bioluminescent glow

02:10:13.367 --> 02:10:15.809
of that same orange coming from plants

02:10:15.809 --> 02:10:19.809
that now suffuse the entirety beneath the water.

02:10:20.887 --> 02:10:23.549
Viridian stops at the edge as well and looks down,

02:10:23.549 --> 02:10:25.273
and turns back to you.

02:10:25.273 --> 02:10:27.773
Anyone here trained in nature?

02:10:30.022 --> 02:10:31.993
Proficient in nature?

02:10:31.993 --> 02:10:33.537
TALIESIN: You'd think so, but no.

02:10:33.537 --> 02:10:35.537
SAM: We all know that the dump stat.

02:10:35.537 --> 02:10:39.213
(laughter)

02:10:39.213 --> 02:10:40.379
LIAM: Sorry, Kiki.
MARISHA: Yeah, I know.

02:10:40.379 --> 02:10:43.777
Keyleth is crying somewhere and she doesn't know why.

02:10:43.777 --> 02:10:46.362
MATT: Viridian at this point, though, does go,

02:10:46.362 --> 02:10:50.529
"Be warned, these and those are torch blooms.

02:10:51.856 --> 02:10:54.079
"They're Fire Plane-native plants

02:10:54.079 --> 02:10:57.467
"that live off the dense nutrients of the inside

02:10:57.467 --> 02:11:00.709
"of this mountain, volcanic regions and such."

02:11:00.709 --> 02:11:01.924
LAURA: Cool.

02:11:01.924 --> 02:11:05.973
MATT: "Avoid touching them, if you can."

02:11:05.973 --> 02:11:07.807
TRAVIS: Will they be under the water?

02:11:07.807 --> 02:11:08.951
I can't, I'm not talking.

02:11:08.951 --> 02:11:11.787
LAURA: Will they be under the water

02:11:11.787 --> 02:11:13.410
as well?

02:11:13.410 --> 02:11:14.501
MATT: "Yes."
LAURA: Okay!

02:11:14.501 --> 02:11:17.007
MATT: And you watch as she then begins--
SAM: How do you do that?

02:11:17.007 --> 02:11:19.998
MATT: -- to wade into the water
before diving below the surface,

02:11:19.998 --> 02:11:22.482
and Viridian vanishes from view.

02:11:22.482 --> 02:11:25.122
MARISHA: Did you ever want to try
ventriloquism or something?

02:11:25.122 --> 02:11:28.066
Fucking-- like, that's insane.

02:11:28.066 --> 02:11:29.130
MATT: Is anyone following?
SAM: Ooh, next campaign.

02:11:29.130 --> 02:11:30.021
LAURA: Yeah, yeah.
TRAVIS: Yes, yes, yes,

02:11:30.021 --> 02:11:30.996
we're going, we're going.
SAM: Next campaign,

02:11:30.996 --> 02:11:32.320
you're going to have a dummy.

02:11:32.320 --> 02:11:34.392
MATT: As you begin to wade into the water,

02:11:34.392 --> 02:11:35.686
it is very warm.

02:11:35.686 --> 02:11:37.339
It's like a hot tub, like.

02:11:37.339 --> 02:11:40.091
It's not to the point of discomfort.

02:11:40.091 --> 02:11:40.924
It's very hot,

02:11:40.924 --> 02:11:42.023
and you can see the steam rising off of it

02:11:42.023 --> 02:11:47.023
as you begin to submerge, but it's not scalding.

02:11:47.134 --> 02:11:49.755
As you continue to step inward

02:11:49.755 --> 02:11:53.702
and watch as the surface eventually comes up over the top,

02:11:53.702 --> 02:11:54.804
there's that uncomfortable moment

02:11:54.804 --> 02:11:57.649
where the breath begins to give out.

02:11:57.649 --> 02:12:00.645
You look around you, and as your feet begin to step

02:12:00.645 --> 02:12:02.111
off the floor and you're now floating above,

02:12:02.111 --> 02:12:05.095
you can see where the blossoms, the torch blooms

02:12:05.095 --> 02:12:08.642
just completely coat the bottom of this little lake.

02:12:08.642 --> 02:12:10.200
LAURA: I'm just going to reach out,

02:12:10.200 --> 02:12:11.834
I'm going to look at Veth, and I'm going to hold her hand.

02:12:11.834 --> 02:12:14.268
SAM: Thank you, because I'm not going in there otherwise.

02:12:14.268 --> 02:12:16.015
TRAVIS: I'll watch everyone's expressions.

02:12:16.015 --> 02:12:19.195
If anyone panics, I'll cast underwater breathing

02:12:19.195 --> 02:12:20.128
on everybody.

02:12:20.128 --> 02:12:23.549
SAM: I'll pull off my Ring of Water Walking, close my eyes

02:12:23.549 --> 02:12:25.631
and just let her pull me in.

02:12:25.631 --> 02:12:28.530
MATT: Okay, it is warm, which is a nice comfort compared

02:12:28.530 --> 02:12:29.471
to all the cold water

02:12:29.471 --> 02:12:32.933
that you've hated being a part of before,

02:12:32.933 --> 02:12:34.375
but those of you who are on the cusp

02:12:34.375 --> 02:12:36.237
of losing their breath,

02:12:36.237 --> 02:12:40.637
you reach a moment where you have to inhale,

02:12:40.637 --> 02:12:42.922
and as you do, the water fills your lungs,

02:12:42.922 --> 02:12:44.610
but it's not as thick as you'd expect.

02:12:44.610 --> 02:12:48.945
It's thicker than air, but it's lighter than

02:12:48.945 --> 02:12:51.360
the sensation of swimming through it,

02:12:51.360 --> 02:12:53.620
and your body instinctually panics for a moment.

02:12:53.620 --> 02:12:56.877
You begin to seize a bit as you feel the body goes

02:12:56.877 --> 02:12:59.530
through the process of the beginning stages of downing,

02:12:59.530 --> 02:13:01.030
and then it calms.

02:13:02.122 --> 02:13:05.495
As you exhale and inhale and exhale.

02:13:05.495 --> 02:13:07.186
SAM: I'm freaking out.
LAURA: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

02:13:07.186 --> 02:13:10.550
MATT: It's a little wild, but the water is breathable.

02:13:10.550 --> 02:13:12.715
TALIESIN: Can we hear each other down here?

02:13:12.715 --> 02:13:13.947
TRAVIS: The Abyss.

02:13:13.947 --> 02:13:14.797
LAURA: Yeah.
MATT: It is very

02:13:14.797 --> 02:13:17.014
similar to The Abyss, actually, yeah.

02:13:17.014 --> 02:13:18.830
LIAM: Little white rat?
TALIESIN: In that case, real quick.

02:13:18.830 --> 02:13:21.930
Lesser Restoration, just I don't feel good.

02:13:21.930 --> 02:13:23.484
MATT: Okay, Lesser Restoration.

02:13:23.484 --> 02:13:25.537
You remove the poison on yourself.

02:13:25.537 --> 02:13:27.791
SAM: Oh, that was easy.

02:13:27.791 --> 02:13:28.997
TALIESIN: Well, it's a spell slot gone.

02:13:28.997 --> 02:13:31.097
MATT: Yeah. It takes a while for you to calm down,

02:13:31.097 --> 02:13:35.610
but you do reach a point where you're calmer.

02:13:35.610 --> 02:13:37.906
It's still a very odd sensation,

02:13:37.906 --> 02:13:40.365
but you're all swimming around this larger lake

02:13:40.365 --> 02:13:43.290
that descends further before coming to an end,

02:13:43.290 --> 02:13:45.395
and you can see Viridian swimming towards

02:13:45.395 --> 02:13:49.243
this heavy cluster of torch booms,

02:13:49.243 --> 02:13:51.680
and looking back in your direction

02:13:51.680 --> 02:13:54.485
gives a hand motion to follow.

02:13:54.485 --> 02:13:56.271
She begins to speak, and it's interesting.

02:13:56.271 --> 02:13:58.578
The water carries the vocal vibrations.

02:13:58.578 --> 02:13:59.411
It is slower.

02:13:59.411 --> 02:14:03.103
So all the voices come across as deeper

02:14:03.103 --> 02:14:07.882
and a little sludgy, but you can speak amongst this,

02:14:07.882 --> 02:14:12.169
and as Viridian says, "Once again, avoid the blooms."

02:14:12.169 --> 02:14:15.489
LAURA: (laughs)

02:14:15.489 --> 02:14:17.656
TRAVIS: Don't touch the flowers.

02:14:18.855 --> 02:14:22.854
SAM: (low-pitched Veth scream-sigh)

02:14:22.854 --> 02:14:25.138
MATT: She turns towards this heavy wall

02:14:25.138 --> 02:14:29.079
of tangled torch bloom plant mass,

02:14:29.079 --> 02:14:32.594
and you watch as it begins to pull away at her approach

02:14:32.594 --> 02:14:37.594
and reveal a continuing tunnel that delves down at a steeper

02:14:38.538 --> 02:14:41.629
almost 80-degree angle from where you are.

02:14:41.629 --> 02:14:43.803
LAURA: We have to swim at an 80 degree angle?

02:14:43.803 --> 02:14:45.139
MARISHA: That's hard.

02:14:45.139 --> 02:14:47.652
LAURA: Good thing we're all very strong swimmers.

02:14:47.652 --> 02:14:48.518
TALIESIN: (uneasy noise)
MATT: You begin making

02:14:48.518 --> 02:14:50.651
your way down to follow Viridian.

02:14:50.651 --> 02:14:52.238
What is the marching order now?

02:14:52.238 --> 02:14:53.801
The tunnel itself that she's going into

02:14:53.801 --> 02:14:55.081
is about 10 feet across

02:14:55.081 --> 02:14:58.795
and the interior is completely surrounded by torch blooms.

02:14:58.795 --> 02:15:00.538
So you can only really go single file

02:15:00.538 --> 02:15:01.588
and you have to be careful.

02:15:01.588 --> 02:15:04.253
TRAVIS: I'll go first since my
swim speed is my normal speed.

02:15:04.253 --> 02:15:06.671
LAURA: I'm going to let Nott go in between me and Fjord

02:15:06.671 --> 02:15:08.770
since he's the strongest swimmer.

02:15:08.770 --> 02:15:09.603
MATT: All right, so, Nott between you and Fjord.

02:15:09.603 --> 02:15:10.436
SAM: (frustrated noise)

02:15:10.436 --> 02:15:12.868
LAURA: I've got your back.
MATT: Who's after Jester?

02:15:12.868 --> 02:15:14.758
LAURA: I'm right here.
MARISHA: I'll go after Jester.

02:15:14.758 --> 02:15:16.626
TALIESIN: And I'll go after Beau.

02:15:16.626 --> 02:15:18.449
MATT: All right, and then Caleb and Yasha?

02:15:18.449 --> 02:15:20.746
LIAM: Yeah, I'll go second to last.
ASHLEY: Yeah, yeah, I'll go last.

02:15:20.746 --> 02:15:23.612
MATT: All right, and Yasha's
at the caboose. Got it. All right.

02:15:23.612 --> 02:15:25.142
SAM: I'm just closing my eyes this whole time.

02:15:25.142 --> 02:15:26.492
You got to push me.

02:15:26.492 --> 02:15:28.078
LAURA: Well, it's difficult.

02:15:28.078 --> 02:15:29.008
You need to open your eyes.

02:15:29.008 --> 02:15:30.331
SAM: Mm-mm.
LAURA: Veth, open your eyes.

02:15:30.331 --> 02:15:31.978
SAM: Nope.

02:15:31.978 --> 02:15:34.603
LIAM: (low-pitched mumbling)

02:15:37.498 --> 02:15:38.803
MATT: You all begin to make your way through,

02:15:38.803 --> 02:15:41.417
and you can see the tunnel shifts rapidly

02:15:41.417 --> 02:15:44.121
and splinters off into different directions.

02:15:44.121 --> 02:15:45.205
There's a strange sensation

02:15:45.205 --> 02:15:46.566
as you hit this portion of the water.

02:15:46.566 --> 02:15:48.770
I need everybody to make a wisdom saving throw, please.

02:15:48.770 --> 02:15:49.621
TRAVIS: Shit.

02:15:49.621 --> 02:15:50.670
MARISHA: A wisdom save.
TRAVIS: Come on, man.

02:15:50.670 --> 02:15:54.098
I got to be rolling better than I have been.

02:15:54.098 --> 02:15:56.923
LIAM: I also have a question.
TRAVIS: Natural 20.

02:15:56.923 --> 02:16:00.448
LIAM: Viridian described all these passages as confusing

02:16:00.448 --> 02:16:01.389
as we've been going.

02:16:01.389 --> 02:16:03.022
Are they supernaturally confusing?

02:16:03.022 --> 02:16:05.859
Or has Caleb been able to track their progression?

02:16:05.859 --> 02:16:08.206
MATT: You've just begun to see the splintering points.

02:16:08.206 --> 02:16:09.588
So, so far at the moment,

02:16:09.588 --> 02:16:12.121
Viridian seems to be swimming with purpose,

02:16:12.121 --> 02:16:14.594
and has a confidence to the path,

02:16:14.594 --> 02:16:16.285
and you know that she is the one who interfaces

02:16:16.285 --> 02:16:17.784
often with Vokodo.

02:16:17.784 --> 02:16:21.093
So following her seems to be the best course of action.

02:16:21.093 --> 02:16:22.082
From what you've seen so far,

02:16:22.082 --> 02:16:23.456
it could be confusing for somebody

02:16:23.456 --> 02:16:24.798
who does not know the pathway.

02:16:24.798 --> 02:16:25.906
LIAM: But I guess my question is:

02:16:25.906 --> 02:16:28.032
Does Keen Mind let me remember

02:16:28.032 --> 02:16:29.138
the exact path we took?

02:16:29.138 --> 02:16:30.146
MATT: It would, yes.

02:16:30.146 --> 02:16:32.352
If you had to backtrack, you'd know that.
LIAM: Okay.

02:16:32.352 --> 02:16:34.504
MATT: Okay.
TRAVIS: Natural 20 for 23.

02:16:34.504 --> 02:16:35.337
MATT: Nice.

02:16:36.932 --> 02:16:37.765
MATT: 11?

02:16:37.765 --> 02:16:39.529
SAM: 110.
MARISHA: Two.

02:16:39.529 --> 02:16:40.917
MATT: All right.
LIAM: 26.

02:16:40.917 --> 02:16:42.208
MATT: 26.

02:16:42.208 --> 02:16:43.626
SAM: 10.
MATT: 10.

02:16:43.626 --> 02:16:45.167
ASHLEY: 14.
MATT: 14.

02:16:45.167 --> 02:16:46.464
TALIESIN: 27.
MATT: 27.

02:16:46.464 --> 02:16:49.013
MARISHA: 17.
MATT: 17, okay.

02:16:49.013 --> 02:16:54.013
Yasha, Veth, and Jester,

02:16:54.171 --> 02:16:57.050
as you're following Viridian,

02:16:57.050 --> 02:16:59.475
there's something

02:16:59.475 --> 02:17:04.342
thrilling about this location you're in.

02:17:04.342 --> 02:17:05.904
The mystery of what's beyond.

02:17:05.904 --> 02:17:07.937
There's something almost calling you.

02:17:07.937 --> 02:17:10.437
There's a drive, a force.

02:17:10.437 --> 02:17:12.977
There's something that's pulling you in the same direction

02:17:12.977 --> 02:17:15.530
as Viridian, but you can sense something's close,

02:17:15.530 --> 02:17:17.652
and you have to see it.

02:17:17.652 --> 02:17:22.635
You have to get there, and you weirdly know the way,

02:17:23.960 --> 02:17:26.502
and so as you all are swimming and following Viridian,

02:17:26.502 --> 02:17:31.060
you watch as Yasha begins to push past,

02:17:31.060 --> 02:17:34.193
and Jester and Veth.

02:17:34.193 --> 02:17:36.006
Suddenly confidence takes you, Veth,

02:17:36.006 --> 02:17:38.490
and the water is not so scary.

02:17:39.628 --> 02:17:43.234
This curiosity, this driving force is much stronger

02:17:43.234 --> 02:17:46.191
than the fear that has been welling up inside you,

02:17:46.191 --> 02:17:50.191
and you are all taking the lead behind Viridian.

02:17:51.153 --> 02:17:53.240
You guys watch as they push past

02:17:53.240 --> 02:17:55.353
and begin scrambling to the front of this line.

02:17:55.353 --> 02:17:56.845
SAM: Okay.
TALIESIN: Oh, well, fine.

02:17:56.845 --> 02:17:58.482
SAM: Still going in the right direction, though, right?

02:17:58.482 --> 02:18:00.727
MATT: Still following Viridian, and it's splintering.

02:18:00.727 --> 02:18:02.513
Some tunnels are curving off.

02:18:02.513 --> 02:18:04.756
Some are smaller, some are larger.

02:18:04.756 --> 02:18:06.193
Some are similar size to what you're at,

02:18:06.193 --> 02:18:10.870
but she seems to be following a very particular journey.

02:18:10.870 --> 02:18:12.735
MARISHA: Beau just looks at Fjord and shrugs.

02:18:12.735 --> 02:18:16.767
LAURA: ♪ We're going to lose our memories sometime ♪

02:18:16.767 --> 02:18:20.068
MARISHA: Jeez Louise, all right.

02:18:20.068 --> 02:18:20.930
SAM: It's all good.

02:18:20.930 --> 02:18:24.407
LAURA: I can't wait to get to where we're going.

02:18:24.407 --> 02:18:26.650
(laughter)

02:18:26.650 --> 02:18:28.934
SAM: This is fun.

02:18:28.934 --> 02:18:30.884
ASHLEY: Me too.

02:18:30.884 --> 02:18:33.411
MARISHA: Is my voice deeper?

02:18:33.411 --> 02:18:35.534
TRAVIS: That did nothing when you talked. You just did this.

02:18:35.534 --> 02:18:37.680
MARISHA: (mumbles)

02:18:37.680 --> 02:18:40.335
TRAVIS: Is my voice deeper?

02:18:40.335 --> 02:18:42.982
TALIESIN: It just sounds like, well.

02:18:42.982 --> 02:18:44.699
TRAVIS: Oh boy.

02:18:44.699 --> 02:18:47.612
Oh, hello.
MARISHA: We're in a pandemic.

02:18:47.612 --> 02:18:50.002
(laughter)

02:18:50.002 --> 02:18:53.704
MATT: Yeah, we're all getting a bit loopy now.

02:18:53.704 --> 02:18:56.995
Pushing through this network of tunnels

02:18:56.995 --> 02:18:59.370
for about 10 minutes or so,

02:18:59.370 --> 02:19:02.892
the anxiety begins to build in the stomachs of those

02:19:02.892 --> 02:19:05.573
who watched their friends hurry on ahead,

02:19:05.573 --> 02:19:06.861
and you fight to keep up.

02:19:06.861 --> 02:19:09.786
There is a fervor to the pace of swimming that them

02:19:09.786 --> 02:19:14.536
and Viridian are taking, and as you struggle to keep up--

02:19:15.388 --> 02:19:17.896
TRAVIS: Can I try and match the three that are anxious

02:19:17.896 --> 02:19:20.062
since my swimming speed is the fastest.

02:19:20.062 --> 02:19:21.061
MATT: You have no problem with this.

02:19:21.061 --> 02:19:23.730
TRAVIS: Okay, just in case they get too far ahead.

02:19:23.730 --> 02:19:27.559
Then, at least, it's Viridian and I plus three.

02:19:27.559 --> 02:19:29.843
LIAM: And the rest of us are slowed, right?

02:19:29.843 --> 02:19:31.711
TRAVIS: Half your speed, right, in the water?

02:19:31.711 --> 02:19:32.769
MATT: Half speed.

02:19:33.797 --> 02:19:34.630
LIAM: Okay.

02:19:36.344 --> 02:19:40.052
MATT: But you push on for about

02:19:40.052 --> 02:19:43.377
10 or so odd minutes of adjustment

02:19:43.377 --> 02:19:46.404
before the pathway suddenly expands

02:19:46.404 --> 02:19:51.234
into a gargantuan underwater chamber

02:19:51.234 --> 02:19:54.764
where you can see the rough, black, glassy volcanic rock

02:19:54.764 --> 02:19:58.888
is broken by heavy patches of torch bloom in corners

02:19:58.888 --> 02:20:01.377
giving off this pockets of light

02:20:01.377 --> 02:20:03.886
in this otherwise lightless room.

02:20:03.886 --> 02:20:08.325
You can see vents bubbling forth from breaks in the rock

02:20:08.325 --> 02:20:11.982
and little stalagmites of the same volcanic pillar covered

02:20:11.982 --> 02:20:15.587
in gathered minerals, and this gas escapes

02:20:15.587 --> 02:20:16.712
and gathers in the ceiling and then

02:20:16.712 --> 02:20:19.459
vanishes through small cracks.

02:20:19.459 --> 02:20:22.797
You can see heavy stalactites that come down,

02:20:22.797 --> 02:20:25.474
some only a few feet, some maybe

02:20:25.474 --> 02:20:27.617
a 40-foot ceiling about you,

02:20:27.617 --> 02:20:29.811
some of them almost touch the ground.

02:20:29.811 --> 02:20:33.936
It is a jagged forest of upside down rock

02:20:33.936 --> 02:20:36.814
coming from above.

02:20:36.814 --> 02:20:39.134
You can see this slight movement as you come in

02:20:39.134 --> 02:20:40.478
and the water disturbs bit that some

02:20:40.478 --> 02:20:43.419
of the nearby torch bloom plants sway

02:20:43.419 --> 02:20:44.844
with the movement of the water.

02:20:44.844 --> 02:20:48.309
As you all swim and enter this chamber,

02:20:48.309 --> 02:20:50.045
you can see some of the rock walls, themselves,

02:20:50.045 --> 02:20:52.973
glow faintly orange with heat

02:20:52.973 --> 02:20:56.806
like there is some sort of volcanic proximity.

02:21:00.036 --> 02:21:01.576
You've now all entered the chamber,

02:21:01.576 --> 02:21:03.688
and those of you who were anxious to get here,

02:21:03.688 --> 02:21:04.938
you've arrived.

02:21:06.441 --> 02:21:08.906
LAURA: Does it feel like-- do we know we've arrived?

02:21:08.906 --> 02:21:10.814
MATT: You do, you know you arrived, and then you're like:

02:21:10.814 --> 02:21:12.920
Why did we-- what are we arriving for?

02:21:12.920 --> 02:21:15.988
TRAVIS: Cavern space is about how big again?

02:21:15.988 --> 02:21:19.960
MATT: From edge to edge, from where you're entering now

02:21:19.960 --> 02:21:23.699
across the way, I'd say it's close to 100 or so feet or more

02:21:23.699 --> 02:21:26.288
on the opposite side, and from what you can see,

02:21:26.288 --> 02:21:28.023
you're not able to see the other edge.

02:21:28.023 --> 02:21:31.054
You just see one edge of the tunnel and a curving wall

02:21:31.054 --> 02:21:33.283
around one side, and there are platforms of rock

02:21:33.283 --> 02:21:34.324
that rise up.

02:21:34.324 --> 02:21:38.023
There's a slight, like a bridge over one growth

02:21:38.023 --> 02:21:39.135
where it looks like elements

02:21:39.135 --> 02:21:41.452
of the nearby rocks have tumbled in

02:21:41.452 --> 02:21:45.469
and created a small incline or just built over time

02:21:45.469 --> 02:21:47.845
from the elements and minerals that are gathering.

02:21:47.845 --> 02:21:50.926
You can see on the opposite end just barely out of sight

02:21:50.926 --> 02:21:53.756
and from a nearby glow, looks like a large pillar of rock

02:21:53.756 --> 02:21:57.058
that twists up and then stops.

02:21:57.058 --> 02:21:58.594
It's really wild interior here,

02:21:58.594 --> 02:22:01.387
but you're free to swim, if you'd like.

02:22:01.387 --> 02:22:03.247
TALIESIN: I'm just going to thank a bunch of plants.

02:22:03.247 --> 02:22:05.807
Thank you for making that clear.

02:22:05.807 --> 02:22:07.356
You didn't have to.
I really appreciate it.

02:22:07.356 --> 02:22:09.632
We'll be coming back real soon.
We'll see you again.

02:22:09.632 --> 02:22:11.716
MATT: As you turn and look, Caduceus, you notice that the

02:22:11.716 --> 02:22:15.617
torch bloom has completely enclosed the

02:22:15.617 --> 02:22:17.289
tunnel behind you.

02:22:17.289 --> 02:22:19.922
It has expanded and swollen

02:22:19.922 --> 02:22:23.653
and knotted the path that you took.

02:22:23.653 --> 02:22:25.947
TALIESIN: We'll be coming back out soon, but thank you.

02:22:25.947 --> 02:22:27.158
TRAVIS: Can I swim forward a little bit

02:22:27.158 --> 02:22:30.751
and just extend Divine Sense in this watery cavern?

02:22:30.751 --> 02:22:32.126
MATT: You may, you may indeed.

02:22:32.126 --> 02:22:35.936
TRAVIS: 60 feet; celestial, fiend, or undead.

02:22:35.936 --> 02:22:37.019
MATT: All righty.

02:22:38.587 --> 02:22:42.004
You put the sense out there in this space and...

02:22:43.320 --> 02:22:44.753
nothing catches your mind.

02:22:44.753 --> 02:22:47.405
Nothing catches your sense.

02:22:47.405 --> 02:22:49.477
LIAM: Caleb is going to start looking for anything

02:22:49.477 --> 02:22:53.551
that is not natural, anything that is man-made

02:22:53.551 --> 02:22:56.635
or humanoid made or of civilization--

02:22:56.635 --> 02:23:00.373
MATT: Make a perception check.
LIAM: -- or higher intelligence, yeah.

02:23:00.373 --> 02:23:04.734
LAURA: Do we still feel anxious, like with a higher purpose

02:23:04.734 --> 02:23:06.221
of getting here or now that we're here,

02:23:06.221 --> 02:23:07.204
do we feel like that's calmed down a bit?

02:23:07.204 --> 02:23:08.377
MATT: Now that you're here, that's washed away.

02:23:08.377 --> 02:23:09.751
It's calm.

02:23:09.751 --> 02:23:12.497
TALIESIN: Do we still feel like we're being watched?

02:23:12.497 --> 02:23:13.860
MATT: Yes, you do.

02:23:13.860 --> 02:23:16.183
In fact, it's more intense than it's ever been.

02:23:16.183 --> 02:23:17.342
LIAM: 25 on perception.

02:23:17.342 --> 02:23:22.021
MATT: 25. You glance around, and the first thing you notice

02:23:22.021 --> 02:23:25.144
as you enter the chamber and swim out a bit

02:23:25.144 --> 02:23:28.261
is there are a couple of shiny glints at some parts

02:23:28.261 --> 02:23:29.805
of the floor.

02:23:29.805 --> 02:23:32.336
You glance over, and the one nearest to you, you look over,

02:23:32.336 --> 02:23:36.600
and it looks like a coin, a gold piece or a silver piece

02:23:36.600 --> 02:23:39.719
just catching the light, and you see a few more scattered

02:23:39.719 --> 02:23:42.147
about 10 or so feet from there and a handful

02:23:42.147 --> 02:23:44.597
that are resting on elements of rock

02:23:44.597 --> 02:23:48.207
in the middle of this underwater cavern.

02:23:48.207 --> 02:23:50.491
LIAM: Without touching it, can I focus on one

02:23:50.491 --> 02:23:52.957
and get closer to it and see if it is indeed a coin

02:23:52.957 --> 02:23:54.082
or something else?

02:23:54.082 --> 02:23:56.569
MATT: Yeah, you swim forward and you grab it and it is--

02:23:56.569 --> 02:23:58.369
LIAM: Without touching.
MATT: Oh, without touching, okay.

02:23:58.369 --> 02:24:02.547
Looking at it, it's got a little bit of soot

02:24:02.547 --> 02:24:03.380
on one edge of it,

02:24:03.380 --> 02:24:06.918
but it does appear to be a Dwendalian gold piece.

02:24:06.918 --> 02:24:08.318
LIAM: Ah.
SAM: Hm.

02:24:09.329 --> 02:24:10.584
TRAVIS: It's a wishing well.

02:24:10.584 --> 02:24:12.219
ASHLEY: What's-- yeah.

02:24:12.219 --> 02:24:13.267
SAM: It's our time down here.

02:24:13.267 --> 02:24:16.069
LIAM: This is our time.
SAM: It's our time.

02:24:16.069 --> 02:24:19.402
ASHLEY: Viridian, how did you find this place?

02:24:20.325 --> 02:24:21.908
MATT: "He calls us here,

02:24:23.485 --> 02:24:27.268
"and he is here."

02:24:27.268 --> 02:24:29.993
And she swims out a little bit into the open space.

02:24:32.912 --> 02:24:34.245
"Vokodo.

02:24:35.779 --> 02:24:39.087
"I come with new... friends."

02:24:40.788 --> 02:24:43.560
At which point, simultaneously,

02:24:43.560 --> 02:24:46.560
sourceless but deep in your mind, a presence...

02:24:47.951 --> 02:24:49.042
is there.

02:24:50.707 --> 02:24:51.768
It's not language.

02:24:51.768 --> 02:24:54.772
It's images and shapes and emotions.

02:24:54.772 --> 02:24:57.416
It is alien, yet still familiar.

02:24:57.416 --> 02:25:00.058
Your brain takes these

02:25:00.058 --> 02:25:03.366
tangled masses of experiences

02:25:03.366 --> 02:25:07.859
and processes it as language best that it can,

02:25:07.859 --> 02:25:09.609
and it speaks to you.

02:25:11.413 --> 02:25:14.980
"I have sensed you

02:25:14.980 --> 02:25:19.688
"since you found paradise.

02:25:21.259 --> 02:25:25.542
"You come to look upon the center

02:25:26.408 --> 02:25:29.907
"of the world and kneel."

02:25:35.469 --> 02:25:37.955
TRAVIS: "Center of the world and kneel"?

02:25:37.955 --> 02:25:39.584
SAM: Should we kneel?

02:25:39.584 --> 02:25:42.292
MARISHA: <i>Can</i> we kneel? We're in water.
TALIESIN: I think we're swimming.

02:25:42.292 --> 02:25:43.428
SAM: Oh, are we in water?

02:25:43.428 --> 02:25:44.953
LAURA: Yeah, we are still in the water.

02:25:44.953 --> 02:25:45.982
SAM: We can't kneel.

02:25:45.982 --> 02:25:48.286
TRAVIS: Are we on the floor or are we in stasis

02:25:48.286 --> 02:25:50.460
in like hovering buoyantly in the middle of water.

02:25:50.460 --> 02:25:51.460
MATT: That's up to you guys.

02:25:51.460 --> 02:25:54.190
You guys can lower yourself and walk along the floor

02:25:54.190 --> 02:25:55.322
or swim along the floor if you want.

02:25:55.322 --> 02:25:56.685
TRAVIS: What is up?

02:25:56.685 --> 02:25:59.628
MATT: Looking up, you see all the heavy rock stalactites

02:25:59.628 --> 02:26:01.134
that are coming down at different levels.

02:26:01.134 --> 02:26:02.573
TRAVIS: Just solid water to the roof?

02:26:02.573 --> 02:26:03.997
MATT: From what you can tell, yeah.

02:26:03.997 --> 02:26:06.695
And your light source is fairly limited at the moment.

02:26:06.695 --> 02:26:08.762
It's just little bits of frost bloom--or, sorry,

02:26:08.762 --> 02:26:12.509
of torch bloom and the spells that you have active.

02:26:12.509 --> 02:26:13.730
Make a perception check.

02:26:13.730 --> 02:26:16.313
TRAVIS: I get 20 feet from the sword.

02:26:19.194 --> 02:26:20.066
18.

02:26:20.066 --> 02:26:21.582
MATT: 18, okay.

02:26:21.582 --> 02:26:24.232
As this voice is happening,
and Caleb, at this point, too,

02:26:24.232 --> 02:26:28.013
as you are hearing this voice, you glance up,

02:26:28.013 --> 02:26:30.496
and in the center of the ceiling

02:26:30.496 --> 02:26:33.329
amongst the

02:26:33.329 --> 02:26:36.014
heavy points of rock that descend,

02:26:36.014 --> 02:26:38.976
you see a couple other glints,

02:26:38.976 --> 02:26:42.842
a couple other little momentary
shines of light reflecting

02:26:42.842 --> 02:26:44.646
off other metallic surfaces

02:26:44.646 --> 02:26:47.129
similar to the one that you noticed.

02:26:51.173 --> 02:26:54.477
Viridian speaks out and says, "Vokodo,

02:26:54.477 --> 02:26:57.267
"great fire lord and protector of the realm,

02:26:57.267 --> 02:27:01.892
"these people come to ask a favor."

02:27:04.562 --> 02:27:07.854
There's a momentary pause before it says,

02:27:07.854 --> 02:27:11.120
"Ah.

02:27:11.120 --> 02:27:16.120
"Speak of this favor,

02:27:16.160 --> 02:27:19.698
"new blood."

02:27:19.698 --> 02:27:21.498
SAM: Maybe we should give some gifts first.

02:27:21.498 --> 02:27:22.728
TRAVIS: Did he say "new blood"?

02:27:22.728 --> 02:27:23.561
MATT: Yes.
SAM: Some gifts?

02:27:23.561 --> 02:27:25.148
ASHLEY: New blood.
TRAVIS: New blood, new blood.

02:27:25.148 --> 02:27:27.264
LAURA: Oh, well, okay.
SAM: Maybe?

02:27:27.264 --> 02:27:29.972
LAURA: Do you want some presents
before we ask you a favor?

02:27:29.972 --> 02:27:30.897
Or do you just want--

02:27:30.897 --> 02:27:34.270
MATT: Before you can finish, "Yes, presents."

02:27:34.270 --> 02:27:36.452
LAURA: Oh, presents, he wants presents.

02:27:36.452 --> 02:27:41.452
SAM: So, while swimming, I guess, I'll try to reach down

02:27:41.454 --> 02:27:45.508
through my pockets and sink a little and come back up,

02:27:45.508 --> 02:27:48.018
and I have a little, tiny diamond.

02:27:48.018 --> 02:27:49.601
It's worth 50 gold.

02:27:54.176 --> 02:27:58.167
Blessings to you, Vokodo.

02:27:58.167 --> 02:28:03.023
Take this as a symbol of our peace offering,

02:28:03.023 --> 02:28:04.922
And I just throw it.

02:28:04.922 --> 02:28:05.897
MATT: You throw it?
SAM: Yeah.

02:28:05.897 --> 02:28:07.694
MATT: Okay, you chuck it and see it (whooshes).

02:28:07.694 --> 02:28:10.691
There is a slight (shushes) shift of movement

02:28:10.691 --> 02:28:13.608
in the shadow above, and it's gone.

02:28:15.326 --> 02:28:17.451
SAM: Did that please you?

02:28:19.619 --> 02:28:21.073
MATT: "Yes."

02:28:21.073 --> 02:28:22.670
SAM: Okay, okay, okay.
LAURA: Nice, nice, nice,

02:28:22.670 --> 02:28:24.759
nice, nice.
SAM: Come on, pony up, everyone.

02:28:24.759 --> 02:28:28.342
MARISHA: I give him my two gold rings that I have,

02:28:29.199 --> 02:28:33.032
and I pull them out in my hand,

02:28:34.240 --> 02:28:36.381
and I just open my hand,

02:28:36.381 --> 02:28:38.168
and I say, these are for you.

02:28:38.168 --> 02:28:41.946
TRAVIS: Oh, you're going to
make him eat out of your hand?

02:28:41.946 --> 02:28:45.199
MARISHA: It's a mistake that
I have made several times in D&amp;D,

02:28:45.199 --> 02:28:46.741
but here we go.

02:28:46.741 --> 02:28:49.708
MATT: Okay, you wait and wait,

02:28:49.708 --> 02:28:52.841
(laughs) and you hear this low,

02:28:54.210 --> 02:28:58.801
almost a guttural rasp

02:28:58.801 --> 02:29:01.176
or a purr is the best way I can describe it.

02:29:01.176 --> 02:29:05.049
It's just like (growls), and for a moment,

02:29:05.049 --> 02:29:07.435
you see images in your mind, briefly,

02:29:07.435 --> 02:29:10.918
of shines and glittering things,

02:29:10.918 --> 02:29:13.876
and silver clouts,

02:29:13.876 --> 02:29:16.475
and in that brief moment, you look back at your hand,

02:29:16.475 --> 02:29:17.621
and the rings are gone.

02:29:17.621 --> 02:29:21.078
You all, actually it would be Caduceus and Caleb,

02:29:21.078 --> 02:29:26.078
as you watch Beauregard recoil a moment briefly taken

02:29:26.219 --> 02:29:30.443
with the vision, you see something dark, this long,

02:29:30.443 --> 02:29:33.875
black tendril just rapidly (shushes)

02:29:33.875 --> 02:29:35.191
and snatch the rings out of her hand,

02:29:35.191 --> 02:29:38.198
and then withdraw back into the dark, lightless ceiling

02:29:38.198 --> 02:29:39.448
of the chamber.

02:29:40.696 --> 02:29:42.412
TRAVIS: Okay.

02:29:42.412 --> 02:29:47.373
I'll reach into my coin purse and grab a handful.

02:29:47.373 --> 02:29:49.123
Let's call it 10 gold,

02:29:50.009 --> 02:29:52.890
and I'll throw it up towards the ceiling.

02:29:52.890 --> 02:29:55.505
MATT: Okay, you throw the coins up, and one by one,

02:29:55.505 --> 02:29:57.213
they just go out.

02:30:00.480 --> 02:30:02.057
LAURA: I...

02:30:02.057 --> 02:30:05.194
MATT: You two and you now can
see with each of these coins,

02:30:05.194 --> 02:30:07.421
these tendrils kind of (whips)

02:30:07.421 --> 02:30:11.262
and fish each out with fairly incredible speed--

02:30:11.262 --> 02:30:12.462
MARISHA: Oh shit.

02:30:12.462 --> 02:30:16.875
MATT: -- all emerging from the
central ceiling of the chamber.

02:30:18.655 --> 02:30:21.280
TRAVIS: No, no.

02:30:21.280 --> 02:30:22.423
LAURA: What?
MARISHA: I don't know.

02:30:22.423 --> 02:30:23.717
TRAVIS: I know.

02:30:23.717 --> 02:30:25.575
ASHLEY: Wait, I was seeing how much money I had.

02:30:25.575 --> 02:30:27.200
LAURA: What are you thinking?
ASHLEY: What happened?

02:30:27.200 --> 02:30:28.633
TRAVIS: I mean--

02:30:29.645 --> 02:30:32.203
LAURA: I am going to pull out

02:30:32.203 --> 02:30:36.153
my one white sequined glove

02:30:36.153 --> 02:30:38.004
(laughter)

02:30:38.004 --> 02:30:40.952
that I've had with me since the very beginning,

02:30:40.952 --> 02:30:43.300
and I'm going to throw it into the air.

02:30:43.300 --> 02:30:45.676
TRAVIS: Not the glove, Jester, no.

02:30:45.676 --> 02:30:47.212
LAURA: It sparkles!

02:30:47.212 --> 02:30:48.474
SAM: It's so valuable.

02:30:48.474 --> 02:30:50.416
LAURA: I know.
SAM: It's too valuable.

02:30:50.416 --> 02:30:53.124
LAURA: I've been holding onto it for so long.

02:30:53.124 --> 02:30:56.164
MATT: The sequined glove travels
approximately a foot and a half

02:30:56.164 --> 02:30:58.269
as it is not a very--

02:30:58.269 --> 02:30:59.102
LAURA: Flow. (laughs)

02:30:59.102 --> 02:31:01.095
MATT: Yeah, It doesn't have a lot of heft behind it

02:31:01.095 --> 02:31:03.157
against the water.

02:31:03.157 --> 02:31:04.973
TRAVIS: A lot of drag.
MATT: Yeah, A lot of drag on that one.

02:31:04.973 --> 02:31:09.920
And it just shimmers a bit,
and then slowly begins to drift--

02:31:09.920 --> 02:31:11.143
(laughter)

02:31:11.143 --> 02:31:13.976
towards the ground.
LAURA: Aw, come on.

02:31:16.101 --> 02:31:18.641
LIAM: Similar to Beauregard,
I also have a gold ring--

02:31:18.641 --> 02:31:19.961
SAM: It just floats back to Jester.

02:31:19.961 --> 02:31:22.427
TRAVIS: Yeah, shoves it back.
LIAM: --that I got somewhere,

02:31:22.427 --> 02:31:24.079
and I'll just put it on my thumb

02:31:24.079 --> 02:31:26.700
and flip it through the water.

02:31:26.700 --> 02:31:30.163
MATT: Okay, (whoops and snips) snatched out

02:31:30.163 --> 02:31:32.520
of the water once more.

02:31:32.520 --> 02:31:37.199
TALIESIN: I'll do the 10 gold
as well and spread them far out.

02:31:37.199 --> 02:31:38.755
See what happens.

02:31:38.755 --> 02:31:39.588
LIAM: Spread 'em.

02:31:39.588 --> 02:31:41.119
MATT: As you throw them out a little bit,

02:31:41.119 --> 02:31:44.248
You see something in the shadow
shift to one side, and then

02:31:44.248 --> 02:31:46.118
(whoosh) a few are fished out.

02:31:46.118 --> 02:31:49.923
You see things wrapping around the outside

02:31:49.923 --> 02:31:52.838
of these stalactites and pulling itself to the other side

02:31:52.838 --> 02:31:54.214
and snatching the other bits before resting

02:31:54.214 --> 02:31:55.411
back in the shadow.

02:31:55.411 --> 02:31:58.961
You see glimmers of orange,

02:31:58.961 --> 02:32:01.252
slight glows that spike

02:32:01.252 --> 02:32:04.059
and brighten for a second and
then vanish in the shadow,

02:32:04.059 --> 02:32:08.568
like the embers at the edge
of somebody burning a pipe,

02:32:08.568 --> 02:32:11.787
brighten and then darken once more.

02:32:11.787 --> 02:32:14.287
LAURA: Did you not want this glove?

02:32:17.051 --> 02:32:19.776
MATT: "You've earned

02:32:20.617 --> 02:32:22.880
"a discussion."

02:32:22.880 --> 02:32:24.630
SAM: Just take it back.
LAURA: I'm just going to pick it up.

02:32:24.630 --> 02:32:25.971
(laughter)

02:32:25.971 --> 02:32:27.304
SAM: It's just sad.

02:32:29.240 --> 02:32:33.689
MATT: "What is your request?"

02:32:33.689 --> 02:32:38.342
LAURA: Well, we were hoping to
have a party on your island.

02:32:38.342 --> 02:32:40.102
SAM: You're leading, I mean--

02:32:40.102 --> 02:32:41.187
LAURA: I mean, just what else am I going to do?

02:32:41.187 --> 02:32:43.360
SAM: Yes, but-- okay.
TALIESIN: Just go with it.

02:32:43.360 --> 02:32:44.313
It's just got to go.

02:32:44.313 --> 02:32:46.531
LAURA: This is a really cool island and so we thought

02:32:46.531 --> 02:32:48.115
maybe we could have a party here

02:32:48.115 --> 02:32:50.504
and invite a bunch of people.

02:32:50.504 --> 02:32:53.804
LIAM: A big party.
LAURA: I don't know how many will come.

02:32:53.804 --> 02:32:56.202
LIAM: Fairly medium-sized.

02:32:56.202 --> 02:32:58.483
MATT: You can see the images flash into your mind,

02:32:58.483 --> 02:33:01.870
images of ships coming to the beaches of the island

02:33:01.870 --> 02:33:05.577
and people offloading and the emotions mingle with that,

02:33:05.577 --> 02:33:08.851
and once again, your brain interprets these images

02:33:08.851 --> 02:33:12.138
and these thoughts and these feelings as language.

02:33:12.138 --> 02:33:15.963
MATT: "How many?"

02:33:17.099 --> 02:33:20.411
LAURA: I wish I had a better answer, you know?

02:33:20.411 --> 02:33:21.782
It could be 20.

02:33:21.782 --> 02:33:23.712
It could be 200.

02:33:23.712 --> 02:33:24.659
SAM: We hope 200.

02:33:24.659 --> 02:33:25.836
LAURA: I don't think it'll be that many.

02:33:25.836 --> 02:33:27.867
It's all really hard trip, you know?

02:33:27.867 --> 02:33:29.626
And I don't know.

02:33:31.240 --> 02:33:35.809
MATT: "And why do they come?"

02:33:35.809 --> 02:33:40.776
LAURA: Well, I have this friend who...

02:33:41.951 --> 02:33:44.000
is...

02:33:44.000 --> 02:33:46.550
also a god

02:33:47.606 --> 02:33:51.984
who thought maybe it would be fun

02:33:51.984 --> 02:33:56.542
to hang out with you and get to know you

02:33:56.542 --> 02:33:58.840
and have a party at your house.

02:33:58.840 --> 02:34:00.627
SAM: Your island is fantastic.

02:34:00.627 --> 02:34:02.030
LAURA: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
SAM: It's a paradise.

02:34:02.030 --> 02:34:05.403
It's sought after across the seas.

02:34:05.403 --> 02:34:07.902
LAURA: Obviously, center of the world and all that.

02:34:07.902 --> 02:34:10.411
People have heard of it far and wide.

02:34:10.411 --> 02:34:14.699
SAM: Even other gods want to experience it.

02:34:14.699 --> 02:34:15.947
LAURA: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

02:34:15.947 --> 02:34:19.797
MATT: "A god that...

02:34:19.797 --> 02:34:24.310
"seeks a party?"

02:34:24.310 --> 02:34:27.537
LAURA: Yeah, well, he's a pretty cool guy,

02:34:27.537 --> 02:34:28.982
and he likes to party.

02:34:28.982 --> 02:34:30.665
MATT: "Please

02:34:30.665 --> 02:34:34.103
"elaborate."

02:34:34.103 --> 02:34:35.269
TRAVIS: Kay, kay.

02:34:36.155 --> 02:34:39.648
LAURA: Have you heard of the Traveler?

02:34:39.648 --> 02:34:42.971
MARISHA: (laughs)

02:34:42.971 --> 02:34:44.384
MATT: "No."

02:34:44.384 --> 02:34:46.192
LAURA: Oh, that's so weird.

02:34:46.192 --> 02:34:49.124
I thought all you gods knew each other.

02:34:49.124 --> 02:34:53.016
MATT: "Bring this Traveler as well.

02:34:54.325 --> 02:34:58.566
"Bring you all that you like.

02:34:59.620 --> 02:35:03.328
"You're all welcome here."

02:35:04.783 --> 02:35:05.616
SAM: Some gifts? Cool.

02:35:06.956 --> 02:35:09.773
That feels really good.

02:35:10.724 --> 02:35:13.382
SAM: Where on the island?
LIAM: Are there any spots on the island?

02:35:13.382 --> 02:35:15.240
SAM: Maybe, limitations?
LIAM: Yeah, off limits or--?

02:35:15.240 --> 02:35:16.290
LAURA: Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

02:35:16.290 --> 02:35:19.481
Where should we have a par--
where should we do it at?

02:35:20.407 --> 02:35:23.340
MATT: "Beyond the mountain."

02:35:23.340 --> 02:35:24.240
SAM: What is she doing?

02:35:24.240 --> 02:35:27.796
MATT: "The choice is yours.

02:35:27.796 --> 02:35:30.179
"You

02:35:30.179 --> 02:35:34.012
"wear such shinies."

02:35:36.368 --> 02:35:39.951
MARISHA: I told you I should've put away my bracers.

02:35:41.102 --> 02:35:44.322
TRAVIS: If you don't mind, we heard of your splendor

02:35:44.322 --> 02:35:45.775
as a fire god.

02:35:45.775 --> 02:35:50.541
I admit, we are but lowly forms of life.

02:35:50.541 --> 02:35:55.522
I'm surprised to see you in this space of water and liquid.

02:35:57.559 --> 02:35:59.172
MATT: Make a deception check.

02:35:59.172 --> 02:36:00.688
MARISHA: Yes, yes, yes.

02:36:02.221 --> 02:36:03.054
ASHLEY: Good, good, good.

02:36:03.054 --> 02:36:05.218
TRAVIS: I think I have advantage on these, right?

02:36:05.218 --> 02:36:06.051
Do I?

02:36:07.373 --> 02:36:09.514
It's an eight-- no, 17.

02:36:10.615 --> 02:36:11.815
18.

02:36:11.815 --> 02:36:12.802
MATT: It's an 18?

02:36:14.066 --> 02:36:16.058
TRAVIS: Do I have advantage on deception checks?

02:36:16.058 --> 02:36:17.765
LAURA: I feel like with your--
LIAM: You should.

02:36:17.765 --> 02:36:18.819
SAM: Some gifts? You have Friends, don't you?

02:36:18.819 --> 02:36:20.824
You can cast Friends.

02:36:20.824 --> 02:36:23.432
LAURA: Oh, that's a good idea.

02:36:23.432 --> 02:36:24.737
MATT: Friends gets a little weird.

02:36:24.737 --> 02:36:27.119
SAM: Oh, yeah because then they know.
LAURA: Because then they know.

02:36:27.119 --> 02:36:30.002
SAM: Hey, by the way, Marisha?
MARISHA: Yeah?

02:36:30.002 --> 02:36:31.597
SAM: A second ago, you were like this.
MARISHA: Uh-huh.

02:36:31.597 --> 02:36:33.769
SAM: I forgot to tell you.

02:36:33.769 --> 02:36:36.169
MARISHA: What did you get me?
SAM: If you ever want to punch Liam.

02:36:36.169 --> 02:36:37.427
MARISHA: Fuck, yes.

02:36:37.427 --> 02:36:38.281
Fuck, yes.

02:36:38.281 --> 02:36:39.947
I love you so much.
SAM: We just need a code,

02:36:39.947 --> 02:36:41.998
and you can be like, "Punch Liam!"

02:36:41.998 --> 02:36:44.089
MARISHA: Okay.
LIAM: Try it out. Try it out.

02:36:44.089 --> 02:36:46.808
MARISHA: Well, how about just "Punch Liam" is the code?

02:36:46.808 --> 02:36:50.294
LIAM: (grunts)
MARISHA: Yeah!

02:36:50.294 --> 02:36:51.382
LIAM: Damn it, Marisha.

02:36:51.382 --> 02:36:52.879
MARISHA: Fuck yes!

02:36:52.879 --> 02:36:53.821
(kisses)

02:36:53.821 --> 02:36:55.904
MATT: Okay, so a total of?
TRAVIS: 18.

02:36:55.904 --> 02:36:57.610
TALIESIN: I hope it was this
funny visually for everyone else

02:36:57.610 --> 02:36:58.674
as it was for us.

02:36:58.674 --> 02:37:01.065
MATT: The water around you--
LIAM: On the forehead?

02:37:01.065 --> 02:37:02.140
LAURA: Wait, wait, wait, listen.

02:37:02.140 --> 02:37:03.389
MATT: Guys.
MARISHA: Sorry.

02:37:03.389 --> 02:37:05.024
MATT: The water around you seems to swirl

02:37:05.024 --> 02:37:07.840
on its own for a moment, and you feel yourself being drawn

02:37:07.840 --> 02:37:10.509
towards the center of the chamber a little bit,

02:37:10.509 --> 02:37:14.045
and as you do, you all watch as the shadows

02:37:14.045 --> 02:37:16.525
up amongst the stalactites,

02:37:16.525 --> 02:37:21.371
hundreds of tiny embers begin to flash and brighten,

02:37:21.371 --> 02:37:25.597
and you watch as tendrils, these big, thick tentacles

02:37:25.597 --> 02:37:28.794
begin to withdraw from the shadows

02:37:28.794 --> 02:37:32.128
and lower this massive,

02:37:32.128 --> 02:37:37.128
black fleshed-creature, where beneath the cracked edges

02:37:37.141 --> 02:37:39.807
of its blackened flesh, you can see beneath it

02:37:39.807 --> 02:37:44.671
this underlying, glowing, yellow-orange layer of flame

02:37:44.671 --> 02:37:48.065
or volcanic material almost.

02:37:48.065 --> 02:37:51.999
As it descends slightly, you can see this open jaws

02:37:51.999 --> 02:37:55.984
with rocky black teeth and the inside of its mouth,

02:37:55.984 --> 02:38:00.616
this bright, fiery light just emerges

02:38:00.616 --> 02:38:04.527
and lights up Fjord's face as it descends

02:38:04.527 --> 02:38:06.999
and gets about 10 feet from you, its mouth open,

02:38:06.999 --> 02:38:09.993
and you're just there lit by it.

02:38:09.993 --> 02:38:12.585
On top of its head, you see four separate orbs,

02:38:12.585 --> 02:38:17.585
themselves also orange and red
with these slight, pointed,

02:38:17.633 --> 02:38:19.441
red pupils.

02:38:19.441 --> 02:38:23.607
You see massive red rocks or gems

02:38:23.607 --> 02:38:25.476
that are jutting from elements of its body

02:38:25.476 --> 02:38:26.977
in different places.

02:38:26.977 --> 02:38:30.736
These heavy, almost like pseudopod,

02:38:30.736 --> 02:38:31.948
what would have been tentacles,

02:38:31.948 --> 02:38:36.113
that have become more like thick legs dangle beneath,

02:38:36.113 --> 02:38:39.913
and as it hangs, you can see, across its back,

02:38:39.913 --> 02:38:43.993
a hoard of treasure.

02:38:43.993 --> 02:38:48.346
You see chests and coins and objects and

02:38:49.247 --> 02:38:53.922
just a scattered mass of things of value

02:38:53.922 --> 02:38:57.983
that have been placed and are now adorning this creature

02:38:57.983 --> 02:38:59.961
like a shawl or a cape,

02:38:59.961 --> 02:39:01.356
MARISHA: That's so fucking cool.

02:39:01.356 --> 02:39:04.256
MATT: And as it dangles there, it says,

02:39:04.256 --> 02:39:06.947
"Look upon the lord

02:39:06.947 --> 02:39:11.947
"of this island, the Lord of Exandria,

02:39:12.105 --> 02:39:14.851
"and offer.

02:39:14.851 --> 02:39:19.060
"You have such shinies."

02:39:20.587 --> 02:39:23.486
You can see the torch blooms in the chamber.

02:39:23.486 --> 02:39:26.168
There looks to be another entrance to this

02:39:26.168 --> 02:39:28.951
that now, all of a sudden, closes up as well.

02:39:33.035 --> 02:39:35.728
MATT: Viridian is now on the ground and says,

02:39:35.728 --> 02:39:38.551
"I-I think he wants another offering."

02:39:38.551 --> 02:39:39.665
MARISHA: Yeah, yeah, that's apparent.
TRAVIS: I'd say that's fair.

02:39:39.665 --> 02:39:43.255
LIAM: What is the distance between this entity and us?

02:39:43.255 --> 02:39:45.205
MATT: Well, you guys are a bit
scattered on the ground at this point.

02:39:45.205 --> 02:39:46.954
You and Fjord are probably the ones that were furthest up

02:39:46.954 --> 02:39:48.903
since you were inspecting.

02:39:48.903 --> 02:39:51.362
It's about 30 feet from you.

02:39:51.362 --> 02:39:54.727
It's about 10 feet from Fjord as it rushed to him

02:39:54.727 --> 02:39:55.843
with the water as close to the face,

02:39:55.843 --> 02:39:56.939
and you're about 10 feet from it.

02:39:56.939 --> 02:39:59.328
TRAVIS: This didn't trigger celestial, fiend, or undead

02:39:59.328 --> 02:40:00.718
with Divine Sense?
MATT: Nope.

02:40:00.718 --> 02:40:02.800
TRAVIS: What, what?
LIAM: Elemental?

02:40:02.800 --> 02:40:04.192
TRAVIS: Elemental.

02:40:04.192 --> 02:40:08.634
ASHLEY: Well, I did not give an offering yet, so.

02:40:11.363 --> 02:40:13.144
SAM: Yeah, do it.

02:40:13.144 --> 02:40:15.644
ASHLEY: I don't have a lot of money.

02:40:16.822 --> 02:40:21.071
I will go over and, um-- closer to him

02:40:21.071 --> 02:40:24.987
and I do have 10 gold.

02:40:24.987 --> 02:40:26.210
Here is 10 gold.

02:40:26.210 --> 02:40:27.887
MATT: One of the eyes kind of (crackles)

02:40:27.887 --> 02:40:29.391
looks down in your direction

02:40:29.391 --> 02:40:30.567
while the other three are still looking

02:40:30.567 --> 02:40:33.275
at Fjord glancing over.

02:40:33.275 --> 02:40:37.176
One of the tentacles (whips) snatches it out of your palm,

02:40:37.176 --> 02:40:39.073
and you watch as it places it (crunches)

02:40:39.073 --> 02:40:42.773
and plucks it amongst the rest of the hoard on its back.

02:40:45.255 --> 02:40:48.249
The waters release you, Fjord,

02:40:48.249 --> 02:40:49.753
and then it stands there waiting

02:40:49.753 --> 02:40:51.861
and Viridian just goes,

02:40:51.861 --> 02:40:55.086
"I don't think he's happy with the offerings you've given.

02:40:56.212 --> 02:40:59.062
"It would do well to--"
TRAVIS: Oh, yes.

02:40:59.062 --> 02:41:00.412
MATT: "-- to give of something sizable

02:41:00.412 --> 02:41:02.464
"based on what you carry."

02:41:02.464 --> 02:41:06.264
MARISHA: Yeah, well, I asked you about this, Viridian,

02:41:06.264 --> 02:41:10.550
and you were like, "No, he's cool, he's understanding.

02:41:10.550 --> 02:41:12.804
"He won't judge you based on your appearance."

02:41:12.804 --> 02:41:16.405
MATT: "Well, it's not by your appearance.

02:41:16.405 --> 02:41:19.320
"Usually we just give him everything we have and find."

02:41:19.320 --> 02:41:20.986
MARISHA: Right, right, yeah.

02:41:20.986 --> 02:41:23.836
LAURA: Well, but we-- we--

02:41:23.836 --> 02:41:25.644
would--

02:41:25.644 --> 02:41:27.758
MARISHA: He's not getting my bracers.

02:41:27.758 --> 02:41:28.591
SAM: No, of course.

02:41:28.591 --> 02:41:30.774
MARISHA: I would fucking murder him
before he takes the fucking bracers.

02:41:30.774 --> 02:41:34.857
LAURA: You know, the thing is we kind of need

02:41:34.857 --> 02:41:37.725
some of the shiny things that we have

02:41:37.725 --> 02:41:42.064
to bring you more people with other shiny things.

02:41:42.064 --> 02:41:43.922
TRAVIS: Well, I do have five of these.

02:41:43.922 --> 02:41:47.856
They're all that I have, and I'll take-out five platinum,

02:41:47.856 --> 02:41:51.915
and I will toss them towards Vokodo.

02:41:51.915 --> 02:41:53.613
MATT: Okay, you watch as two of the eyes

02:41:53.613 --> 02:41:55.755
that were facing you look off towards the platinum

02:41:55.755 --> 02:42:00.755
and you can now see its four massive tentacles with a bunch

02:42:00.772 --> 02:42:04.240
of smaller ones that occasionally emerge from the body

02:42:04.240 --> 02:42:06.875
to snatch things nearby and then recoil it in.

02:42:06.875 --> 02:42:09.057
TRAVIS: Shrimp legs.
MARISHA: So cool, yeah, yeah, yeah.

02:42:09.057 --> 02:42:11.020
MATT: It snatches the coins out and brings them back in,

02:42:11.020 --> 02:42:12.351
but the one eye is still focused on you.

02:42:12.351 --> 02:42:15.993
There's the one that's over on Caleb or over now on Yasha,

02:42:15.993 --> 02:42:18.402
and it just stays there dangling.

02:42:18.402 --> 02:42:22.253
LIAM: Yeah, I'm going to slowly start
backing off from this thing

02:42:22.253 --> 02:42:23.277
one foot at a time.

02:42:23.277 --> 02:42:25.004
TRAVIS: There is more where that came from,

02:42:25.004 --> 02:42:28.652
but we would have to perhaps take an entry fee

02:42:28.652 --> 02:42:30.600
from all those coming to the island.

02:42:30.600 --> 02:42:33.548
LAURA: Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
TRAVIS: If that's of interest to you?

02:42:33.548 --> 02:42:35.710
LAURA: God, we could bring you so much more

02:42:35.710 --> 02:42:37.185
after everyone gets here.

02:42:37.185 --> 02:42:39.774
LIAM: Yeah, this is just the down payment.

02:42:39.774 --> 02:42:41.614
MATT: "You will."

02:42:41.614 --> 02:42:42.780
LAURA: Yeah, we totally will.

02:42:42.780 --> 02:42:45.337
Doesn't that get heavy on your back?

02:42:46.363 --> 02:42:47.946
MATT: "No."

02:42:49.008 --> 02:42:50.900
LAURA: It's impressive.
TALIESIN: Yeah, it's very impressive.

02:42:50.900 --> 02:42:52.100
MATT: "It is just an extension."

02:42:52.100 --> 02:42:53.348
LAURA: That's true, though.
Things are not as heavy in the water.

02:42:53.348 --> 02:42:57.199
TALIESIN: Oh, that's fair. That make sense.
LAURA: Maybe that's why we're under water now.

02:42:57.199 --> 02:42:58.032
TALIESIN: Yeah.

02:43:00.338 --> 02:43:02.695
MATT: You see it looking about the rest of you.

02:43:02.695 --> 02:43:05.671
ASHLEY: Have you been here just forever?

02:43:05.671 --> 02:43:07.421
How did you get here?

02:43:08.351 --> 02:43:11.018
MATT: "Curious questions.

02:43:11.999 --> 02:43:14.949
"I've been here a very

02:43:14.949 --> 02:43:16.499
"long

02:43:16.499 --> 02:43:17.774
"time."

02:43:20.767 --> 02:43:24.290
MARISHA: I pull out a pearl necklace that I also have,

02:43:24.290 --> 02:43:27.370
MATT: (whips) Snatched up.

02:43:27.370 --> 02:43:32.336
MARISHA: And then I say in Deep Speech:

02:43:34.095 --> 02:43:37.362
Curious minds want to know.

02:43:40.390 --> 02:43:42.390
What are you doing here?

02:43:45.987 --> 02:43:49.607
MATT: It doesn't seem to flinch or react to the language.

02:43:49.607 --> 02:43:50.979
The way that it's communicating to you

02:43:50.979 --> 02:43:55.155
is a form of telepathy that transcends language.

02:43:55.155 --> 02:43:57.480
It's what ever you are envisioning,

02:43:57.480 --> 02:43:59.179
it's not the words that communicate

02:43:59.179 --> 02:44:00.804
but the intent behind it.

02:44:00.804 --> 02:44:02.170
MARISHA: Yeah.

02:44:03.404 --> 02:44:08.046
MATT: Which, to that degree,
makes it challenging, in some ways,

02:44:08.046 --> 02:44:11.421
to circumvent social barriers,

02:44:13.483 --> 02:44:15.258
But you see it kind of--

02:44:16.858 --> 02:44:18.466
there's an air of impatience to it

02:44:18.466 --> 02:44:22.152
as you see the rummaging flames
beneath its skin beginning

02:44:22.152 --> 02:44:24.905
to brighten and flair at moments.

02:44:24.905 --> 02:44:27.454
It seems still expectant and Viridian,

02:44:27.454 --> 02:44:30.420
you see a little fright in her eyes like,

02:44:30.420 --> 02:44:34.194
"We really want to make sure that

02:44:34.194 --> 02:44:37.919
"our offerings are up to his liking."

02:44:40.120 --> 02:44:43.016
SAM: We're going to have to
cough up something nice here, guys.

02:44:43.016 --> 02:44:44.642
LAURA: I mean.

02:44:44.642 --> 02:44:46.350
LIAM: Is there any kind of cover in this room

02:44:46.350 --> 02:44:47.955
or is it just a large open space?

02:44:47.955 --> 02:44:49.146
MATT: There's plenty of cover.

02:44:49.146 --> 02:44:52.403
There are masses of rock that have either fallen

02:44:52.403 --> 02:44:53.542
from the ceiling or have risen up

02:44:53.542 --> 02:44:58.318
from gathering elements and minerals.

02:44:58.318 --> 02:45:03.174
You can see that large, twisting pillar-like mass

02:45:03.174 --> 02:45:06.187
on further in the other side of the room.

02:45:06.187 --> 02:45:09.265
You can see there are small outcroppings where some

02:45:09.265 --> 02:45:12.275
of the chamber itself, becomes a wall in areas,

02:45:12.275 --> 02:45:13.840
little corners.

02:45:13.840 --> 02:45:15.870
LIAM: Anything in the middle of the room did you describe?

02:45:15.870 --> 02:45:19.249
MATT: In the middle of the room,
there is one large broken heap

02:45:19.249 --> 02:45:22.168
of rock with one leaning like a pillar

02:45:22.168 --> 02:45:23.835
and there's a tunnel that goes through it,

02:45:23.835 --> 02:45:26.711
and then there is that large, twisted pillar that rises up

02:45:26.711 --> 02:45:29.905
about 25 or so feet before it levels off.

02:45:29.905 --> 02:45:33.302
LIAM: Okay, I will move slowly
towards the jumbled bit trying

02:45:33.302 --> 02:45:36.510
to understand if the thing is tracking me as I go.

02:45:36.510 --> 02:45:39.038
MATT: Okay, are you going stealthily?

02:45:39.038 --> 02:45:40.249
LIAM: Yeah.
MATT: Roll a stealth check.

02:45:40.249 --> 02:45:41.449
LIAM: Yeah.

02:45:42.866 --> 02:45:43.761
SAM: As he does, I'll go--

02:45:43.761 --> 02:45:44.594
LIAM: 17.

02:45:44.594 --> 02:45:45.713
MATT: 17, okay.

02:45:45.713 --> 02:45:49.880
SAM: I'll search through the bag of holding, I guess.

02:45:51.145 --> 02:45:54.620
I own a 550 gold piece

02:45:55.762 --> 02:45:57.668
pouch of gold dust.

02:45:57.668 --> 02:45:59.323
MATT: You do.

02:45:59.323 --> 02:46:03.123
Caleb, as you slowly shift in the direction,

02:46:03.123 --> 02:46:04.223
you begin to make your way towards there,

02:46:04.223 --> 02:46:07.783
and you watch one of the eyes train on you.

02:46:10.735 --> 02:46:12.988
LIAM: You are very shiny.

02:46:12.988 --> 02:46:15.421
MATT: "Indeed."

02:46:16.301 --> 02:46:19.661
LIAM: I throw 10 platinum into the water above me.

02:46:20.603 --> 02:46:23.504
MATT: You watch as two tentacles that are holding it

02:46:23.504 --> 02:46:26.588
to the ceiling, those other two that are dangling below,

02:46:26.588 --> 02:46:30.174
smaller ones eject and grab the platinum

02:46:30.174 --> 02:46:31.375
and pull them back in.

02:46:31.375 --> 02:46:33.528
You watch as they attach to the body,

02:46:33.528 --> 02:46:34.996
they slowly move them up

02:46:34.996 --> 02:46:38.293
like a bunch of cilia or fingers causing the coins

02:46:38.293 --> 02:46:40.205
to roll up the body until they join the rest

02:46:40.205 --> 02:46:41.190
of the hoard on its back.

02:46:41.190 --> 02:46:43.737
LAURA: Does the hoard look like it's only shiny things?

02:46:43.737 --> 02:46:45.070
Or is it like--?

02:46:46.231 --> 02:46:47.322
MATT: Make a perception check,

02:46:47.322 --> 02:46:48.460
LIAM: Yeah, that's what I want to know.

02:46:48.460 --> 02:46:51.113
MATT: And this will be probably with disadvantage

02:46:51.113 --> 02:46:52.619
unless you have darkvision.

02:46:52.619 --> 02:46:53.452
LAURA: I do.

02:46:53.452 --> 02:46:54.315
MATT: There you go.

02:46:55.173 --> 02:46:56.006
SAM: I don't like this.

02:46:56.006 --> 02:47:00.103
LAURA: (singsong) Doesn't matter
because I rolled like fucking shit.

02:47:00.103 --> 02:47:01.591
SAM: ♪ Fucking shit ♪

02:47:01.591 --> 02:47:02.713
LAURA: ♪ Nine ♪

02:47:02.713 --> 02:47:04.295
MATT: Nine, it's hard to make out.

02:47:04.295 --> 02:47:05.720
From what you can see, there's a lot of coins.

02:47:05.720 --> 02:47:08.684
You see some really fancy dishware.

02:47:08.684 --> 02:47:11.992
You can see some weapons, some armor.

02:47:11.992 --> 02:47:16.441
It's a smattering of things, but nothing at a glance

02:47:16.441 --> 02:47:18.716
that catches your eye beyond what you would expect a bunch

02:47:18.716 --> 02:47:20.321
of precious things to look like.

02:47:20.321 --> 02:47:22.851
TRAVIS: Jester, you're confident that the Traveler will want

02:47:22.851 --> 02:47:24.995
to come and meet Vokodo, yes?

02:47:24.995 --> 02:47:27.094
LAURA: Yeah, yeah, yeah, the Traveler's definitely

02:47:27.094 --> 02:47:29.308
going to want to come and say hi.

02:47:29.308 --> 02:47:32.897
TRAVIS: Okay, then I don't mind handing this over,

02:47:32.897 --> 02:47:36.380
and I will hold up the Star Razor.

02:47:36.380 --> 02:47:37.213
SAM: (gasps)

02:47:37.213 --> 02:47:40.007
LAURA: No, no! Fjord, no.

02:47:40.007 --> 02:47:41.228
MATT: You watch as all four--
LAURA: Fjord!

02:47:41.228 --> 02:47:42.061
TRAVIS: No, no, it's okay.

02:47:42.061 --> 02:47:44.228
Vokodo deserves the shiny.

02:47:45.543 --> 02:47:48.810
MATT: Make a persuasion check for me.

02:47:49.769 --> 02:47:51.273
LIAM: Do it, come on, face man.

02:47:51.273 --> 02:47:52.431
Come on, face man.

02:47:52.431 --> 02:47:53.465
SAM: Piss off a god.

02:47:53.465 --> 02:47:55.610
TRAVIS: 20, 15 plus five.

02:47:55.610 --> 02:47:57.526
MARISHA: Yes!
SAM: All right, all right, all right.

02:47:57.526 --> 02:48:02.526
MATT: All right, you watch as all four eyes

02:48:03.377 --> 02:48:06.780
shift towards the blade that you now hold aloft.

02:48:06.780 --> 02:48:07.745
Is it lit?

02:48:07.745 --> 02:48:08.660
TRAVIS: It is, it's glowing.

02:48:08.660 --> 02:48:11.856
MATT: Yeah, and so as it's right there on the blade--

02:48:11.856 --> 02:48:12.743
LIAM: It is lit.

02:48:12.743 --> 02:48:16.928
MATT: Yeah, (laughs) you watch as it descends slightly more,

02:48:16.928 --> 02:48:18.652
and one of the tendrils, the bigger ones,

02:48:18.652 --> 02:48:21.255
begins to reach out towards the blade.

02:48:21.255 --> 02:48:25.611
"This is a precious offering."

02:48:25.611 --> 02:48:27.081
TRAVIS: It is.

02:48:27.081 --> 02:48:30.200
We expect to be able to go and bring more to you

02:48:30.200 --> 02:48:31.595
in exchange for this.

02:48:31.595 --> 02:48:33.095
MATT: Takes the blade,

02:48:34.520 --> 02:48:38.419
places it amongst the hoard on its back.

02:48:38.419 --> 02:48:43.028
"Your offering is accepted."

02:48:45.308 --> 02:48:46.506
The eyes begin to shift

02:48:46.506 --> 02:48:49.859
amongst the rest of you expectantly.

02:48:49.859 --> 02:48:51.146
You also notice the temperature of the room

02:48:51.146 --> 02:48:53.486
getting slightly hotter.

02:48:53.486 --> 02:48:57.376
The water is rising in temperature

02:48:57.376 --> 02:49:01.510
along with the expectant frustration

02:49:01.510 --> 02:49:05.139
that the slightly brightening, simmering fires

02:49:05.139 --> 02:49:10.098
beneath the skin seem to insinuate.

02:49:14.307 --> 02:49:16.623
TRAVIS: Do you require more

02:49:16.623 --> 02:49:19.498
for us to go and bring you?

02:49:20.539 --> 02:49:23.555
MATT: "<i>Your</i> offering was accepted."

02:49:23.555 --> 02:49:25.514
TRAVIS: Oh, shit.

02:49:28.107 --> 02:49:30.360
LAURA: Ugh. I pull out--

02:49:30.360 --> 02:49:31.614
SAM: Here, take this.

02:49:31.614 --> 02:49:33.449
Take the bag of gold.

02:49:33.449 --> 02:49:37.382
LAURA: No, I have a thing of elven chainmail

02:49:39.687 --> 02:49:41.007
that I pull out.

02:49:41.007 --> 02:49:41.840
MATT: Okay.

02:49:43.913 --> 02:49:46.842
SAM: (rattling)

02:49:46.842 --> 02:49:48.192
MATT: (tentacles whipping)

02:49:49.233 --> 02:49:52.777
"Your offering is accepted."

02:49:52.777 --> 02:49:55.712
TRAVIS: We are just paying this dude.

02:49:55.712 --> 02:49:58.876
SAM: I got this for you!

02:49:58.876 --> 02:49:59.972
MATT: And you throw the pouch of gold?

02:49:59.972 --> 02:50:01.253
LAURA: This fucking sucks.

02:50:01.253 --> 02:50:03.277
MATT: You watch as the pouch gets snatched up,

02:50:03.277 --> 02:50:05.029
the tentacle pulls it over by one of the eyes

02:50:05.029 --> 02:50:07.140
and opens it up, and you see, for a moment,

02:50:07.140 --> 02:50:09.508
this large fiery entity becomes

02:50:09.508 --> 02:50:13.425
this miserly grandpa rummaging through the pot.

02:50:16.571 --> 02:50:17.953
You can see the flame

02:50:17.953 --> 02:50:21.109
inside the mouth get a little bit brighter

02:50:21.109 --> 02:50:23.450
and it looks at you expectantly.

02:50:23.450 --> 02:50:24.307
TRAVIS and LAURA: (sigh)

02:50:24.307 --> 02:50:27.408
SAM: Wait, that was a lot of gold.

02:50:27.408 --> 02:50:30.623
That was 550 gold.

02:50:30.623 --> 02:50:32.365
He doesn't like gold.

02:50:32.365 --> 02:50:34.532
TRAVIS: I think he wants your--

02:50:35.494 --> 02:50:38.035
SAM: Well, he can't have it!

02:50:42.168 --> 02:50:44.261
MATT: The temperature's getting hotter now.

02:50:44.261 --> 02:50:48.589
LIAM: Caleb has watched all this and is doing math

02:50:48.589 --> 02:50:51.333
and just stares at the floor for a solid 30 seconds

02:50:51.333 --> 02:50:53.586
while all that has been going on,

02:50:53.586 --> 02:50:57.886
and then grips the necklace on him

02:50:57.886 --> 02:51:00.477
and snaps the cord--

02:51:01.327 --> 02:51:03.647
TRAVIS: No, no, no! The thing that hides you?
LIAM: -- and holds it up--

02:51:03.647 --> 02:51:06.293
LAURA: (gasps) No, Caleb!

02:51:06.293 --> 02:51:09.504
LIAM: -- and lets it go and lets it float in the water.

02:51:09.504 --> 02:51:11.939
MATT: The creature, its eyes spin about,

02:51:11.939 --> 02:51:15.043
and snatch it up.

02:51:15.043 --> 02:51:20.043
Pluck it amongst. One of the eyes looks at you.

02:51:22.294 --> 02:51:25.952
"This was precious to you."

02:51:27.862 --> 02:51:28.878
LIAM: <i>Ja</i>.

02:51:30.527 --> 02:51:33.093
MATT: "Your offering is accepted."

02:51:37.042 --> 02:51:39.801
LAURA: That's not fair. That
glove was real precious to me, too.

02:51:39.801 --> 02:51:41.740
(laughter)

02:51:41.740 --> 02:51:43.073
LIAM: One of a kind.

02:51:44.845 --> 02:51:46.569
TRAVIS: Fuck, oh, man.

02:51:48.785 --> 02:51:51.580
SAM: Maybe I could have my pouch of gold back

02:51:51.580 --> 02:51:52.871
if I gave you something?

02:51:52.871 --> 02:51:57.871
(laughter)

02:51:57.876 --> 02:51:59.959
TRAVIS: That's how it works in Vegas.

02:51:59.959 --> 02:52:03.442
Give me the 50 bucks back, I'll give you 100.

02:52:08.391 --> 02:52:09.449
LIAM: Delete.

02:52:11.028 --> 02:52:13.419
SAM: We got three accepted offers so far?

02:52:13.419 --> 02:52:14.252
LAURA: Mm-hmm.

02:52:14.252 --> 02:52:16.717
SAM: Do we all have to--
MARISHA: Do we all have to go?

02:52:16.717 --> 02:52:21.226
TRAVIS: Yes, I don't want to get sous vide in this cave.

02:52:23.478 --> 02:52:24.843
That's how you get cooked by his slow cooking.

02:52:24.843 --> 02:52:29.843
LAURA: Yeah, I know, I know, I know. (laughs)

02:52:29.910 --> 02:52:31.427
MARISHA: I pull out my pouch--

02:52:31.427 --> 02:52:32.357
TRAVIS: Didn't know what it was.

02:52:32.357 --> 02:52:35.790
MARISHA: -- of very rare and expensive suude.

02:52:37.188 --> 02:52:38.679
LIAM: Cooking spice?

02:52:39.565 --> 02:52:44.216
(laughter)
MARISHA: This shit is gold

02:52:44.216 --> 02:52:46.053
depending on where you're from.

02:52:46.053 --> 02:52:47.059
SAM: The street value?

02:52:47.059 --> 02:52:49.350
MARISHA: You don't understand

02:52:49.350 --> 02:52:52.391
how long this shit can fuck you up.

02:52:53.403 --> 02:52:55.237
You don't get it.

02:52:55.237 --> 02:52:59.427
I've been waiting to murder somebody

02:52:59.427 --> 02:53:02.477
with this my entire journey.

02:53:04.919 --> 02:53:06.482
MATT: Make a persuasion check.

02:53:06.482 --> 02:53:10.881
MARISHA: All right, I'm not good at that, okay.

02:53:10.881 --> 02:53:12.964
TRAVIS: There's always a first.

02:53:15.626 --> 02:53:16.663
MARISHA: Natural 20.

02:53:16.663 --> 02:53:18.836
(cheering)

02:53:18.836 --> 02:53:19.751
MARISHA: Look at it!

02:53:19.751 --> 02:53:21.620
Look at it!

02:53:21.620 --> 02:53:22.861
LIAM: I can't, you're 47 feet away.

02:53:22.861 --> 02:53:26.737
MARISHA: I'll take a picture and send it to the group.

02:53:26.737 --> 02:53:30.302
Now, wait, wait, sorry, that one got blurry.

02:53:30.302 --> 02:53:32.235
I'm texting it.

02:53:32.235 --> 02:53:33.068
I'm texting it.

02:53:33.068 --> 02:53:34.307
MATT: For a total of?

02:53:34.307 --> 02:53:35.238
MARISHA: Huh?

02:53:35.238 --> 02:53:36.163
TRAVIS: What's your total?

02:53:36.163 --> 02:53:38.697
MARISHA: Oh, a 21.

02:53:38.697 --> 02:53:40.236
TRAVIS: Oh, yeah, you are shitty at that.

02:53:40.236 --> 02:53:41.403
MARISHA: Yeah.
MATT: Yeah.

02:53:43.354 --> 02:53:44.667
MARISHA: Texted it for proof.

02:53:44.667 --> 02:53:47.726
MATT: You watch as one of the tendrils shoots out

02:53:47.726 --> 02:53:49.571
in your direction

02:53:49.571 --> 02:53:54.571
and traces the outside of the bracers on your wrist,

02:53:54.945 --> 02:53:57.246
LAURA: Ugh.
LIAM: Ooh, gross.

02:53:57.246 --> 02:53:58.079
MARISHA: Yeah.

02:53:58.079 --> 02:54:02.645
MATT: And then takes the pouch, shakes it a bit.

02:54:02.645 --> 02:54:03.856
MARISHA: It's good shit.

02:54:03.856 --> 02:54:05.835
It's fucking pure.

02:54:05.835 --> 02:54:06.668
All right.

02:54:08.883 --> 02:54:10.537
Have fun, man.

02:54:10.537 --> 02:54:14.337
MATT: It's like the odd kind of, I don't know,

02:54:14.337 --> 02:54:17.844
cosmic horror version of the hoarder woman in Labyrinth.

02:54:17.844 --> 02:54:21.448
LAURA: Yeah, I tried to send the
most telepathic images I can

02:54:21.448 --> 02:54:26.437
of him getting super fucked up on it to let him know.

02:54:26.437 --> 02:54:27.724
MARISHA: Yeah, it's a good time.

02:54:27.724 --> 02:54:31.854
LAURA: I'm really thinking real
hard so that it can get to him.

02:54:31.854 --> 02:54:34.116
LIAM: I gave him a magic item I've had for 100 episodes.

02:54:34.116 --> 02:54:35.287
You gave him oregano.

02:54:35.287 --> 02:54:36.729
(laughter)

02:54:36.729 --> 02:54:39.988
MARISHA: No, this is the rare shit, dude.

02:54:39.988 --> 02:54:43.054
LIAM: <i>Good</i> oregano, really good oregano.
MARISHA: I have a thing for it.

02:54:43.054 --> 02:54:44.410
LAURA: Oh, wow.

02:54:44.410 --> 02:54:45.477
MARISHA: I have a paper for it.

02:54:45.477 --> 02:54:46.677
LIAM: Ah.
MARISHA: It's real,

02:54:46.677 --> 02:54:48.373
LIAM: Plus one oregano.
MARISHA: This isn't Viagra.

02:54:48.373 --> 02:54:51.366
MATT: (laughs)
SAM: All right, all right, all right.

02:54:51.366 --> 02:54:54.117
MATT: Caduceus, you were saying.

02:54:54.117 --> 02:54:57.883
TALIESIN: Precious to you or precious to us, precious to me?

02:54:57.883 --> 02:55:00.200
MATT: "Precious."

02:55:00.200 --> 02:55:01.743
MARISHA: Wondrous item.

02:55:01.743 --> 02:55:03.071
LAURA: Oh, it's a wondrous item?

02:55:03.071 --> 02:55:04.507
MARISHA: Yes!

02:55:04.507 --> 02:55:07.237
LIAM: Tell him to hit me with the glove.

02:55:07.237 --> 02:55:08.562
TRAVIS: No.

02:55:10.784 --> 02:55:12.317
MARISHA: Yeah, that's right.

02:55:12.317 --> 02:55:14.917
TALIESIN: I take the shield that my sister made.

02:55:14.917 --> 02:55:17.152
LAURA: (gasps) No.
TRAVIS: Oh no.

02:55:17.152 --> 02:55:18.522
LIAM: Oh shit.

02:55:18.522 --> 02:55:22.323
TALIESIN: Off of where it's connected to the one I use.

02:55:22.323 --> 02:55:25.873
I take the beetle skins that she made

02:55:30.856 --> 02:55:32.214
and I hold it.

02:55:36.206 --> 02:55:37.197
TRAVIS: Oh shit.

02:55:40.914 --> 02:55:45.614
(dark electronic music)

02:55:52.048 --> 02:55:54.215
MATT: Make a persuasion check.

02:55:55.237 --> 02:55:56.570
TRAVIS: Dark Caduceus.

02:55:57.432 --> 02:55:59.432
TALIESIN: Where's my persuasion?

02:56:01.779 --> 02:56:02.612
Seven.

02:56:04.208 --> 02:56:06.185
MATT: You watch as one of the tendrils scrapes

02:56:06.185 --> 02:56:08.716
across the surface and then (whips)

02:56:08.716 --> 02:56:10.716
snaps it with the metal.

02:56:11.895 --> 02:56:15.012
The head looks at you (growls).

02:56:17.694 --> 02:56:20.212
You can see edges of its mouth become beak-like

02:56:20.212 --> 02:56:21.212
at the edge.

02:56:22.997 --> 02:56:26.085
It's a weird creature.

02:56:26.085 --> 02:56:29.743
You're not quite certain what it is, what it was.

02:56:29.743 --> 02:56:31.024
It's strange.

02:56:31.024 --> 02:56:32.344
TRAVIS: What it was?

02:56:32.344 --> 02:56:35.493
SAM: Yasha, flask me.

02:56:35.493 --> 02:56:36.947
ASHLEY: Did that suffice?

02:56:36.947 --> 02:56:37.798
SAM: Gimme.

02:56:37.798 --> 02:56:41.131
MATT: It's still looking at you expectantly.

02:56:44.080 --> 02:56:46.413
TALIESIN: I put it back on my pouch.

02:56:49.510 --> 02:56:52.406
ASHLEY: (laughs)

02:56:52.406 --> 02:56:54.827
MATT: It is lowering itself more.

02:56:54.827 --> 02:56:58.899
There is an element of a greedy immediacy

02:56:58.899 --> 02:57:03.531
to its physicality, now, as it slowly begins to descend

02:57:03.531 --> 02:57:08.531
and it releases the upper portions of the ceiling

02:57:08.773 --> 02:57:10.744
where the stalactites were,

02:57:10.744 --> 02:57:13.365
and it's now floating and swimming in the air.

02:57:13.365 --> 02:57:15.823
It is a massive form.

02:57:15.823 --> 02:57:19.563
It's maybe about 20 feet in diameter from side to side

02:57:19.563 --> 02:57:22.904
with the tentacles there swirling and swimming

02:57:22.904 --> 02:57:23.861
in the middle of the water.

02:57:23.861 --> 02:57:25.171
TALIESIN: I think I got an idea.

02:57:25.171 --> 02:57:26.259
Hold on, okay.

02:57:26.259 --> 02:57:27.759
Not to me, to you.

02:57:28.808 --> 02:57:33.358
I wrest the golden gem

02:57:33.358 --> 02:57:35.608
that's stuck in my breastplate

02:57:35.608 --> 02:57:38.266
which is the wound closure.

02:57:38.266 --> 02:57:39.232
MATT: Mm.

02:57:41.031 --> 02:57:42.522
TALIESIN: Mm!

02:57:42.522 --> 02:57:44.431
LAURA: (laughs)

02:57:47.781 --> 02:57:49.264
MATT: (whips)

02:57:53.105 --> 02:57:55.838
"Your offer is accepted."

02:57:58.541 --> 02:58:00.116
SAM: Give me that flask.

02:58:04.475 --> 02:58:05.741
Please?

02:58:09.480 --> 02:58:13.397
I'll take one little sip and then hand it over.

02:58:15.057 --> 02:58:16.379
MATT: Make a persuasion check.

02:58:16.379 --> 02:58:18.215
SAM: Oh, I'm great at that.

02:58:18.215 --> 02:58:20.751
LIAM: I would kill for that flask.

02:58:20.751 --> 02:58:25.751
SAM: I will take my reliable
talent, which will make it a 12.

02:58:26.171 --> 02:58:29.595
(laughter)
LAURA: Oh, god.

02:58:29.595 --> 02:58:33.365
MATT: It grabs the flask and brings it up, looks it over,

02:58:33.365 --> 02:58:35.464
SAM: Magical, platinum.
MATT: One eye, brings it

02:58:35.464 --> 02:58:39.399
in front of another, places it amongst the hoard

02:58:39.399 --> 02:58:41.750
and looks back at you expectantly.

02:58:41.750 --> 02:58:43.675
ALL: Oh!

02:58:43.675 --> 02:58:45.625
LAURA: That is just bullshit!

02:58:45.625 --> 02:58:47.809
TRAVIS: Too much.
MARISHA: Too much.

02:58:49.590 --> 02:58:50.432
Fuck this guy.

02:58:50.432 --> 02:58:51.568
LAURA: I hate this guy.

02:58:51.568 --> 02:58:52.797
TRAVIS: Give him your husband.

02:58:52.797 --> 02:58:56.311
(laughter)

02:58:56.311 --> 02:58:58.181
ASHLEY: We should just kill him and take all the stuff.

02:58:58.181 --> 02:59:00.736
MARISHA: Yeah, I mean, look at his haul.

02:59:00.736 --> 02:59:02.088
SAM: That was a fucking--
ASHLEY: That was a lot.

02:59:02.088 --> 02:59:03.146
LIAM: Yeah.

02:59:03.146 --> 02:59:07.525
TRAVIS: I'd sure love to do
that with a Traveler on our side.

02:59:07.525 --> 02:59:09.475
ASHLEY: Yeah, okay,

02:59:10.708 --> 02:59:12.875
LIAM: It's Jester's dream.
ASHLEY: I...

02:59:19.377 --> 02:59:20.973
I pull out my Skingorger--

02:59:20.973 --> 02:59:23.072
LIAM: (gasps)

02:59:23.072 --> 02:59:24.302
and I chuck it at him.

02:59:24.302 --> 02:59:25.135
SAM: Oh!

02:59:25.135 --> 02:59:27.233
MATT: (whips) The blade is immediately captured

02:59:27.233 --> 02:59:30.066
by one of the tendrils.
SAM: That's so heavy metal.

02:59:30.066 --> 02:59:33.462
MATT: The mouth almost hangs open slightly looking over it

02:59:33.462 --> 02:59:37.948
with awe and excitement and then adds the blade to the hoard

02:59:37.948 --> 02:59:39.114
and goes,

02:59:39.114 --> 02:59:42.638
"Your offer is accepted."

02:59:42.638 --> 02:59:45.420
ASHLEY: I would like that back one day.

02:59:45.420 --> 02:59:47.020
MATT: (low chuckle)

02:59:50.023 --> 02:59:52.663
SAM: We've given you so much.

02:59:52.663 --> 02:59:54.217
I gave you a diamond.

02:59:54.217 --> 02:59:55.660
I gave you a bag of gold.

02:59:55.660 --> 02:59:57.345
I gave you my flask.

02:59:57.345 --> 02:59:58.808
TRAVIS: Peel your tattoo off.

02:59:58.808 --> 03:00:00.089
MARISHA: I gave him my good drugs.

03:00:00.089 --> 03:00:01.977
SAM: I mean I don't have much left.

03:00:01.977 --> 03:00:04.727
TRAVIS: Pull your tattoo off your face.

03:00:06.156 --> 03:00:08.095
LIAM: What's the good shit at the top?

03:00:08.095 --> 03:00:10.127
SAM: (cocking noise)
LAURA: No.

03:00:10.127 --> 03:00:12.097
MARISHA: No!
SAM: I got a pistol.

03:00:12.097 --> 03:00:14.183
MARISHA: Oh, thought it was the crossbow.

03:00:14.183 --> 03:00:16.967
SAM: It's a gun, they're really hard to find.

03:00:16.967 --> 03:00:18.657
LIAM: Not like this.
MARISHA: Not like this.

03:00:18.657 --> 03:00:19.907
SAM: It goes boom.

03:00:21.859 --> 03:00:23.728
Any interest?

03:00:23.728 --> 03:00:24.924
MATT: Make a persuasion check.

03:00:24.924 --> 03:00:27.522
SAM: I am not good at those!

03:00:27.522 --> 03:00:29.103
TRAVIS: Come on, come on.
LIAM: He'll take it regardless.

03:00:29.103 --> 03:00:31.536
MARISHA: Come on.
SAM: I'll take my reliable talent.

03:00:31.536 --> 03:00:33.794
(laughter)
ASHLEY: Oh no!

03:00:33.794 --> 03:00:36.889
SAM: It's a 12.
ASHLEY: Come on, come on.

03:00:36.889 --> 03:00:39.776
MATT: The water around you, Veth--

03:00:39.776 --> 03:00:41.208
SAM: Uh-huh.

03:00:41.208 --> 03:00:43.637
MATT: -- has elevated to scalding.

03:00:43.637 --> 03:00:45.637
(groaning)
SAM: Okay, okay, forget that.

03:00:45.637 --> 03:00:46.955
That was stupid, that was stupid.

03:00:46.955 --> 03:00:49.517
MATT: You take four points of fire damage

03:00:49.517 --> 03:00:50.575
SAM: All right.
MARISHA: What?

03:00:50.575 --> 03:00:54.933
MATT: As you've begun to be boiled in the water around you.

03:00:57.563 --> 03:00:59.730
ASHLEY: (whispers) Should've kept your flask.

03:01:00.661 --> 03:01:01.654
SAM: I'm looking.

03:01:01.654 --> 03:01:03.393
Give me a second, it's hot.

03:01:03.393 --> 03:01:04.957
Is it hot in here for you guys?

03:01:04.957 --> 03:01:06.024
TRAVIS: It's pretty hot. It's getting hot.

03:01:06.024 --> 03:01:07.240
SAM: It's begun to get hot.
TALIESIN: Humid too.

03:01:07.240 --> 03:01:08.606
ASHLEY: I feel okay.

03:01:10.242 --> 03:01:12.533
MATT: "One does not walk

03:01:12.533 --> 03:01:16.636
"into the heart of a god

03:01:16.636 --> 03:01:21.015
"and present paltry gifts."

03:01:21.015 --> 03:01:22.756
TRAVIS: (quietly) Okay.

03:01:22.756 --> 03:01:23.589
LIAM: Caleb--

03:01:23.589 --> 03:01:28.339
MATT: "I accept offerings

03:01:29.648 --> 03:01:32.131
"or I can take

03:01:32.131 --> 03:01:35.745
"what is insufficient."

03:01:35.745 --> 03:01:37.045
TRAVIS: (exhales)

03:01:39.806 --> 03:01:44.072
LIAM: Caleb floats over to Veth and

03:01:44.072 --> 03:01:45.805
turns his back to the thing

03:01:45.805 --> 03:01:47.938
and palms to her the...

03:01:49.321 --> 03:01:51.542
the driftglobe.

03:01:51.542 --> 03:01:52.627
SAM: What's that?

03:01:52.627 --> 03:01:55.398
LIAM: I don't use it very much, but it makes sunlight.

03:01:55.398 --> 03:01:56.648
It's very rare.

03:01:57.646 --> 03:01:58.720
So, it's this big.

03:01:58.720 --> 03:02:01.883
It makes daylight in a big space

03:02:01.883 --> 03:02:04.107
and you just get that shoved into your hands,

03:02:04.107 --> 03:02:06.089
and then I float back two or three feet.

03:02:06.089 --> 03:02:07.847
MATT: Okay.
SAM: Thank you.

03:02:12.474 --> 03:02:14.964
MATT: Go ahead and make a
sleight of hand check for me.

03:02:14.964 --> 03:02:15.927
TRAVIS: Uh-oh.

03:02:15.927 --> 03:02:17.715
ASHLEY: Maybe we should just use that in here.

03:02:17.715 --> 03:02:19.015
LAURA: I know, I feel like that could be useful in here.

03:02:19.015 --> 03:02:20.172
LIAM: Nine.

03:02:20.172 --> 03:02:22.325
MATT: Nine, okay.
MARISHA: Nine.

03:02:22.325 --> 03:02:25.610
MATT: You don't feel confident, but also,

03:02:25.610 --> 03:02:28.147
you're not sure if this creature cares.

03:02:28.147 --> 03:02:30.759
LIAM: I wasn't trying to Magic Castle this thing.

03:02:30.759 --> 03:02:32.987
I was just going take this.

03:02:32.987 --> 03:02:35.075
LIAM: Obviously, with a nine.

03:02:35.075 --> 03:02:37.026
(laughter)
TALIESIN: Wow.

03:02:37.026 --> 03:02:38.592
SAM: I don't--

03:02:39.801 --> 03:02:41.659
I'll-- I'll-- I'll--

03:02:41.659 --> 03:02:44.042
I'll cast Mage Hand,

03:02:44.042 --> 03:02:48.035
and I will use it to lift up my Dagger of Denial.

03:02:48.035 --> 03:02:49.847
We'll try that.

03:02:49.847 --> 03:02:52.845
MARISHA: Which is what we are all in right now.

03:02:52.845 --> 03:02:54.928
MATT: The dagger is snatched.

03:02:57.026 --> 03:02:59.143
"Your offer is accepted."

03:02:59.143 --> 03:03:01.091
The water cools around you.

03:03:01.091 --> 03:03:03.011
It's still uncomfortably hot for all of you,

03:03:03.011 --> 03:03:07.330
it's on the verge, but it begins to cool slightly.

03:03:07.330 --> 03:03:09.871
You're no longer taking damage, Veth.

03:03:09.871 --> 03:03:14.671
The images translated into this voice say,

03:03:16.661 --> 03:03:21.202
"Your initial gifts will tide me over.

03:03:22.148 --> 03:03:25.881
"Bring to me these travelers,

03:03:27.131 --> 03:03:30.508
"and the next time we meet,

03:03:30.508 --> 03:03:33.175
"I hope to see what you bring me."

03:03:36.076 --> 03:03:38.016
You watch as the tunnel where you entered,

03:03:38.016 --> 03:03:42.414
the torch blooms withdraw and leave it open once more,

03:03:42.414 --> 03:03:43.672
and Viridian goes,

03:03:43.672 --> 03:03:46.396
"Of course, great Vokodo, thank you.

03:03:46.396 --> 03:03:48.586
"Thank you." (whispers) "We should go."

03:03:48.586 --> 03:03:49.586
TRAVIS: Yes.

03:03:51.396 --> 03:03:56.396
MATT: She goes ahead and swims back as you all (laughs)...

03:03:56.894 --> 03:04:00.160
SAM: Angry backstroke.
(laughter)

03:04:02.450 --> 03:04:04.042
MATT: All right, you all begin to making your way

03:04:04.042 --> 03:04:07.010
into the torch bloom tunnel.

03:04:07.010 --> 03:04:10.135
TRAVIS: We can follow Viridian or
we can follow Caleb, either way.

03:04:10.135 --> 03:04:12.354
SAM: Or maybe, my Mage Hand is still up.

03:04:12.354 --> 03:04:14.711
I could just try to swipe one thing back from it.

03:04:14.711 --> 03:04:17.668
TRAVIS: Maybe don't.
SAM: No, maybe not, okay.

03:04:17.668 --> 03:04:19.423
LAURA: I say go for it.

03:04:19.423 --> 03:04:21.168
SAM: Angry backstroke.

03:04:21.168 --> 03:04:22.484
LIAM: (whispers) We're trying to make a party!

03:04:22.484 --> 03:04:23.709
TALIESIN: Well, it was nice knowing Veth.

03:04:23.709 --> 03:04:27.996
SAM: Angry side stroke.
(laughter)

03:04:27.996 --> 03:04:29.492
MATT: All right, so, are you guys all heading back?

03:04:29.492 --> 03:04:30.548
TALIESIN: Oh, yeah.
LAURA: Yeah.

03:04:30.548 --> 03:04:31.443
LIAM: Yeah, yeah.
MATT: Okay.

03:04:31.443 --> 03:04:32.627
So Viridian begins to lead you back,

03:04:32.627 --> 03:04:35.006
and you watch as you're heading in that direction,

03:04:35.006 --> 03:04:39.673
the torch blooms are separating to enable the exit path.

03:04:41.374 --> 03:04:44.515
You guys get a ways away and Viridian looks back

03:04:44.515 --> 03:04:46.098
over her shoulder swimming.

03:04:47.881 --> 03:04:49.597
"That was harrowing.

03:04:49.597 --> 03:04:52.397
"You were very, how best to say it,

03:04:53.263 --> 03:04:55.191
"unexpectedly stingy."

03:04:55.191 --> 03:04:57.294
TRAVIS: Well, we told you we didn't want to stay.

03:04:57.294 --> 03:04:59.139
I mean, no wonder no one leaves.

03:04:59.139 --> 03:05:01.306
He doesn't leave them with anything left.

03:05:01.306 --> 03:05:04.516
MATT: "Well, there are those who have much to thank Vokodo

03:05:04.516 --> 03:05:06.352
"for his protection and guidance."

03:05:06.352 --> 03:05:08.377
MARISHA: Like what?
MATT: "Material possessions mean so little

03:05:08.377 --> 03:05:10.562
"when it comes to life and happiness and community."

03:05:10.562 --> 03:05:11.587
MARISHA: What's he do?

03:05:11.587 --> 03:05:13.364
What community does he bring

03:05:13.364 --> 03:05:16.327
that you all don't bring yourselves?

03:05:16.327 --> 03:05:18.586
MATT: "(frustrated sigh)" She keeps swimming goes,

03:05:18.586 --> 03:05:21.295
"There are many dangers across this island.

03:05:21.295 --> 03:05:24.195
"There are many things that can sleep beneath it.

03:05:24.195 --> 03:05:26.095
MARISHA: Sure.
MATT: "Vokodo keeps them at bay."

03:05:26.095 --> 03:05:27.840
MARISHA: Does he?
LAURA: Vokodo brings them.

03:05:27.840 --> 03:05:31.264
MARISHA: Yeah, I think that's 100% fucking right.

03:05:31.264 --> 03:05:32.922
ASHLEY: Also, it's interesting because you were saying

03:05:32.922 --> 03:05:35.133
that thing was not where it was supposed to be.

03:05:35.133 --> 03:05:39.102
So it looks like, you know, the thing with the mouth,

03:05:39.102 --> 03:05:40.190
the long one?

03:05:40.190 --> 03:05:41.885
LIAM: Specter.
ASHLEY: Specter.

03:05:41.885 --> 03:05:46.266
MATT: "Indeed. I mean, we've given
everything we have to Vokodo,

03:05:46.266 --> 03:05:49.903
"and we mine what we can from the island itself.

03:05:49.903 --> 03:05:52.308
"I fear maybe we've been--"

03:05:52.308 --> 03:05:53.141
MARISHA: Duped?

03:05:53.141 --> 03:05:54.378
MATT: "--unable to provide as much--"

03:05:54.378 --> 03:05:56.440
MARISHA: Oh, sorry, keep going.

03:05:56.440 --> 03:05:58.465
MATT: "-- as the fire god needs.

03:05:58.465 --> 03:06:00.315
"Perhaps he's angry. His--"

03:06:02.005 --> 03:06:04.588
LAURA: Gods don't need things.

03:06:05.666 --> 03:06:07.726
MATT: "That's inherently untrue."

03:06:07.726 --> 03:06:09.915
LAURA: They don't, they don't need things.

03:06:09.915 --> 03:06:12.860
Gods don't need anything, they're gods.

03:06:12.860 --> 03:06:16.976
MATT: "Yet every church, every temple has offerings given

03:06:16.976 --> 03:06:19.239
"day in and day out by followers and priests."

03:06:19.239 --> 03:06:22.185
LAURA: That's just because those people want to do it.

03:06:22.185 --> 03:06:25.036
It's not because gods are coming down and snatching things

03:06:25.036 --> 03:06:25.932
out of their hands.

03:06:25.932 --> 03:06:27.624
It's not like the gods are saying "I'm going to kill you

03:06:27.624 --> 03:06:29.293
"if you don't give me something."

03:06:29.293 --> 03:06:30.382
It's totally different.

03:06:30.382 --> 03:06:32.182
SAM: Yeah, I was getting cooked in there.

03:06:32.182 --> 03:06:36.906
LIAM: Perhaps you could expound on the ways that Vokodo

03:06:36.906 --> 03:06:39.802
aids you in exchange for these gifts.

03:06:39.802 --> 03:06:42.550
How does his aid to you manifest itself?

03:06:42.550 --> 03:06:45.526
MATT: "This entire island provides us food, shelter,

03:06:45.526 --> 03:06:48.034
"a place to live, a community of people.

03:06:48.034 --> 03:06:49.973
"There have been terrors that have made their way here,

03:06:49.973 --> 03:06:53.682
"but the angry mountain itself washed them away.

03:06:53.682 --> 03:06:57.178
"We've heard tales and been given dreams of the horrors

03:06:57.178 --> 03:07:02.020
"that would feast upon us if the fire god was not here

03:07:02.020 --> 03:07:03.740
"with his benevolence to watch over us."

03:07:03.740 --> 03:07:05.122
TALIESIN: Where are we right now?

03:07:05.122 --> 03:07:06.930
MATT: You guys are swimming through the tunnel

03:07:06.930 --> 03:07:08.127
making your way back.
TALIESIN: Okay, I'm going to wait then.

03:07:08.127 --> 03:07:09.458
All right.

03:07:09.458 --> 03:07:11.273
MARISHA: Oh, yeah, we should call him Guacamole.

03:07:11.273 --> 03:07:12.719
That was our codename.

03:07:12.719 --> 03:07:16.201
TRAVIS: Does Vokodo ever leave this cavern?

03:07:16.201 --> 03:07:18.884
Does he ever venture outside of the volcano?

03:07:18.884 --> 03:07:20.194
MATT: "Vokodo does not need to.

03:07:20.194 --> 03:07:22.400
"Vokodo is the island.

03:07:22.400 --> 03:07:26.616
"What we saw there was just the heart, the avatar."

03:07:26.616 --> 03:07:28.688
TRAVIS: Just the heart?

03:07:28.688 --> 03:07:30.771
Just one piece of Vokodo?

03:07:30.771 --> 03:07:31.744
MATT: "Yes."

03:07:31.744 --> 03:07:33.494
TRAVIS: Oh.
LAURA: Just his physical.

03:07:33.494 --> 03:07:36.041
TRAVIS: Are there other hearts around
the island, or just the one?

03:07:36.041 --> 03:07:39.199
MATT: "Just the one, as far as I know,
that I've met at least,

03:07:39.199 --> 03:07:41.091
"but these tunnels are part of him,

03:07:41.091 --> 03:07:42.931
"this mountain, those trees."

03:07:42.931 --> 03:07:43.827
LIAM: It's the long game.

03:07:43.827 --> 03:07:44.660
SAM: Yeah.

03:07:46.171 --> 03:07:47.825
TRAVIS: Boy, boy, boy, boy, boy.

03:07:47.825 --> 03:07:50.492
MARISHA: There's a lot to unpack, yeah.

03:07:51.732 --> 03:07:53.030
LAURA: I'm not asking this out loud.

03:07:53.030 --> 03:07:55.621
Did Vokodo's image,

03:07:55.621 --> 03:07:57.812
did it spark any kind of--

03:07:59.713 --> 03:08:02.938
had we ever seen it anything like that shape before?

03:08:04.131 --> 03:08:06.366
MATT: Make an arcana check.

03:08:06.366 --> 03:08:07.457
TRAVIS: Or the book worms?

03:08:07.457 --> 03:08:09.393
MATT: Yeah, you can make one--
TALIESIN: I try to get them out

03:08:09.393 --> 03:08:10.421
far enough to get a good look at it, by the way.

03:08:10.421 --> 03:08:12.840
MATT: -- and both of you can
make it since you were trained.

03:08:12.840 --> 03:08:13.673
MARISHA: Arcana?

03:08:13.673 --> 03:08:14.506
MATT: Arcana.

03:08:16.131 --> 03:08:17.166
LAURA: 15.

03:08:17.166 --> 03:08:18.275
MATT: 15, okay.

03:08:19.747 --> 03:08:22.167
TRAVIS: I got no fucking clue.
MARISHA: Yikes, nine.

03:08:22.167 --> 03:08:23.804
MATT: Nine. Caleb?

03:08:23.804 --> 03:08:24.637
LIAM: Yeah?
MARISHA: Save us.

03:08:24.637 --> 03:08:25.470
MATT: Arcana check?

03:08:25.470 --> 03:08:26.697
LIAM: Arcana check, yeah, sorry.

03:08:26.697 --> 03:08:28.145
MATT: It's okay.
LIAM: Was distracted by

03:08:28.145 --> 03:08:31.712
other things, 14.

03:08:31.712 --> 03:08:33.270
Low roll.
MATT: Nothing.

03:08:33.270 --> 03:08:37.010
Nothing about its form, its demeanor, its physicality.

03:08:37.010 --> 03:08:41.719
The stories around it ring a bell.

03:08:41.719 --> 03:08:46.185
It's an odd and strange experience

03:08:46.185 --> 03:08:47.374
that you've gone through

03:08:47.374 --> 03:08:50.412
and interfaced with this thing and as you worm your way back

03:08:50.412 --> 03:08:55.370
towards the exit of this watery passage,

03:08:55.370 --> 03:08:57.420
you're frustrated.

03:08:58.497 --> 03:09:02.852
TRAVIS: Hopefully, whatever we bring when the Traveler

03:09:02.852 --> 03:09:05.999
and all of his followers come is more pleasing

03:09:05.999 --> 03:09:07.089
to Vokodo this time.

03:09:07.089 --> 03:09:09.388
We hate to be a burden upon you or your people.

03:09:09.388 --> 03:09:10.787
MATT: "Of course, of course.

03:09:10.787 --> 03:09:12.187
"Well, you say many are coming

03:09:12.187 --> 03:09:15.857
"and if they are bringing tidings with them

03:09:15.857 --> 03:09:16.982
"and these offerings are brought,

03:09:16.982 --> 03:09:21.165
"perhaps that will temper his...

03:09:21.165 --> 03:09:23.273
"frustration."

03:09:23.273 --> 03:09:25.963
TRAVIS: Certainly, I suppose it will be up to Jester

03:09:25.963 --> 03:09:28.075
and the rest of us to figure out what part

03:09:28.075 --> 03:09:30.596
of the island we should direct them to.

03:09:30.596 --> 03:09:34.294
SAM: Perhaps we should go search some other areas

03:09:34.294 --> 03:09:36.769
after a night's rest

03:09:36.769 --> 03:09:40.068
to see if there's a proper staging ground for?

03:09:40.068 --> 03:09:41.038
LAURA: Yeah.

03:09:41.038 --> 03:09:43.572
TRAVIS: He seemed to say anywhere besides the mountain.

03:09:43.572 --> 03:09:45.793
Is that what you understood?

03:09:45.793 --> 03:09:48.568
MATT: "If you're welcome to, but

03:09:50.168 --> 03:09:52.945
"the mountain has its own inherent dangers.

03:09:52.945 --> 03:09:55.895
"The island entirely has its own."

03:09:55.895 --> 03:09:56.728
TRAVIS: Clearly.

03:09:56.728 --> 03:09:59.479
TALIESIN: Ghosts, dinosaurs, stuff.

03:09:59.479 --> 03:10:01.601
(laughter)

03:10:01.601 --> 03:10:03.401
TRAVIS: Caduceus.
SAM: That's the episode title

03:10:03.401 --> 03:10:04.484
right there.

03:10:04.484 --> 03:10:05.500
LIAM: Yep.

03:10:06.881 --> 03:10:10.156
TALIESIN: Join me for an episode of
Ghosts, Dinosaurs, and Stuff.

03:10:10.156 --> 03:10:14.209
MATT: I think that's exactly what it's going to be, yeah.

03:10:14.209 --> 03:10:16.260
I'm going to write that down.

03:10:16.260 --> 03:10:18.093
TRAVIS: Might have spoilers.

03:10:19.181 --> 03:10:20.239
Oh my god.

03:10:22.907 --> 03:10:25.372
MATT: Perfect.
SAM: Wha--

03:10:25.372 --> 03:10:28.239
I mean, I guess thank you for bringing us.

03:10:28.239 --> 03:10:29.564
TALIESIN: Are you going to stay with us

03:10:29.564 --> 03:10:31.680
as we explore the rest of the island, or--?

03:10:33.974 --> 03:10:36.494
MATT: "Depends on how much you plan to explore.

03:10:36.494 --> 03:10:39.481
"This passage here is one that I make

03:10:39.481 --> 03:10:41.864
"rather rapid pilgrimage on to

03:10:41.864 --> 03:10:44.139
"bring the offerings and findings

03:10:44.139 --> 03:10:46.704
"that the village has gathered upon the island

03:10:46.704 --> 03:10:51.104
"and from those who come to visit and eventually stay.

03:10:52.835 --> 03:10:56.744
"To be too far gone would be to ignore my duties

03:10:56.744 --> 03:11:00.755
"as the spiritual guardian of the village.

03:11:00.755 --> 03:11:02.840
"Perhaps for a brief time

03:11:02.840 --> 03:11:04.533
"and depending on where you choose to journey,

03:11:04.533 --> 03:11:08.033
"but my heart and my

03:11:08.033 --> 03:11:09.833
"charge is with Vo."

03:11:09.833 --> 03:11:12.429
TALIESIN: We do what--
LAURA: Does Vo ever get-- sorry.

03:11:12.429 --> 03:11:15.953
TALIESIN: No.
LAURA: Does Vo ever get pissed at you?

03:11:15.953 --> 03:11:19.155
You know, because don't the villagers run out of things

03:11:19.155 --> 03:11:21.136
to give him?

03:11:21.136 --> 03:11:24.232
MATT: "Well, then we make them and we mine them

03:11:24.232 --> 03:11:26.824
"and we scrounge and search."

03:11:26.824 --> 03:11:29.976
TALIESIN: You mine from him?
LAURA: Yeah, exactly,

03:11:29.976 --> 03:11:30.909
he is the island.

03:11:30.909 --> 03:11:33.776
So your basically pulling out his own poop

03:11:33.776 --> 03:11:36.091
to give back to him or something?

03:11:36.091 --> 03:11:38.155
MATT: You can see behind the eyes,

03:11:38.155 --> 03:11:41.240
there is an attempt--
MARISHA: Some logic?

03:11:41.240 --> 03:11:44.270
MATT: -- to tie these together and then they squint

03:11:44.270 --> 03:11:46.501
and, "We do not question.

03:11:46.501 --> 03:11:49.312
"We just accept and appreciate what is offered."

03:11:49.312 --> 03:11:53.912
MARISHA: Yeah, but it's your own thing going

03:11:53.912 --> 03:11:55.337
against your own thing.

03:11:55.337 --> 03:11:57.065
TALIESIN: How far are we now, by the way?

03:11:57.065 --> 03:12:00.172
MATT: You guys are now coming towards the edge of the tunnel

03:12:00.172 --> 03:12:02.775
where it opens up into the pool where you first submerged.

03:12:02.775 --> 03:12:05.785
TALIESIN: I think I'm going to try
that thing once we bed down for the night.

03:12:05.785 --> 03:12:07.193
I think we're going to have to bed down tonight.

03:12:07.193 --> 03:12:08.793
LAURA: Yeah, once we get

03:12:08.793 --> 03:12:09.763
out of the toxic air.
MARISHA: You're going to camp with us,

03:12:09.763 --> 03:12:10.717
yeah?

03:12:10.717 --> 03:12:12.252
MATT: "Of course, we should rest for the night,

03:12:12.252 --> 03:12:15.408
"but we should leave the dangerous elements of the cavern.

03:12:15.408 --> 03:12:17.699
"I would recommend staying probably within the mouth

03:12:17.699 --> 03:12:19.399
"of the entrance."
LIAM: Yeah, at the edge.

03:12:19.399 --> 03:12:20.608
MATT: "Yes."

03:12:20.608 --> 03:12:21.674
SAM: Okay.

03:12:21.674 --> 03:12:24.728
LAURA: When we went to see him, did we go down

03:12:24.728 --> 03:12:26.259
or did we just stay even?

03:12:26.259 --> 03:12:27.351
MATT: You went down.

03:12:27.351 --> 03:12:29.877
LAURA: So we're underground to see Vokodo?

03:12:29.877 --> 03:12:30.954
MATT: Yes.

03:12:30.954 --> 03:12:32.293
TRAVIS: Yeah, we went up a mountain

03:12:32.293 --> 03:12:34.347
into a mouth and then down.

03:12:34.347 --> 03:12:36.797
LAURA: Has Vokodo ever come out of the mountain?

03:12:36.797 --> 03:12:38.096
TRAVIS: That's what I asked.

03:12:38.096 --> 03:12:39.680
He said he didn't need to

03:12:39.680 --> 03:12:41.003
because he is the island.
LAURA: Obviously, yeah, yeah,

03:12:41.003 --> 03:12:42.635
obviously.

03:12:42.635 --> 03:12:47.016
SAM: Viridian, has Vokodo ever come out of the mountain?

03:12:47.016 --> 03:12:49.249
MATT: "No, no, he has not."

03:12:49.249 --> 03:12:53.139
LAURA: How many entrances are there into the mountain?

03:12:53.139 --> 03:12:54.782
MATT: "I know there are probably a few,

03:12:54.782 --> 03:12:57.580
"but this is the one that has been allocated to me.

03:12:57.580 --> 03:13:02.201
"Vokodo prefers to prevent others from stumbling

03:13:02.201 --> 03:13:07.201
"upon the interior of his heart chamber for fear of--"

03:13:07.808 --> 03:13:10.103
ASHLEY: Taking him by surprise, or--?

03:13:10.103 --> 03:13:15.103
MATT: "Or for fear of those arriving
without a proper offering."

03:13:15.307 --> 03:13:20.290
LIAM: What's the most valuable offering
you ever gave to Vokodo?

03:13:20.290 --> 03:13:22.133
LAURA: Please, she doesn't remember.

03:13:22.133 --> 03:13:25.828
LIAM: Maybe.
MATT: She thinks for a moment and goes,

03:13:25.828 --> 03:13:30.019
"There was once a ship that came,

03:13:30.019 --> 03:13:35.019
"pirates of some kind, and they were carrying a jewel

03:13:35.084 --> 03:13:37.322
"that they had stolen.

03:13:37.322 --> 03:13:39.849
"That was worth quite a bit.

03:13:39.849 --> 03:13:44.766
"Beautiful and green, this emerald about the size of a fist,

03:13:45.731 --> 03:13:48.728
"but the pirates never left.

03:13:48.728 --> 03:13:52.885
"They joined the community and when the gem was given,

03:13:52.885 --> 03:13:54.902
"Vokodo was elated.

03:13:55.774 --> 03:13:59.108
"For the next spring, we had quite a bountiful harvest

03:13:59.108 --> 03:14:01.271
"of the local jungles and trees.

03:14:01.271 --> 03:14:05.204
"The fruits were lush, the gifts were endless."

03:14:05.204 --> 03:14:07.460
ASHLEY: Does--
SAM: It was an emerald,

03:14:07.460 --> 03:14:08.636
sorry, sorry, sorry, no, you go.

03:14:08.636 --> 03:14:11.279
ASHLEY: No, go ahead because I
have a question outside of the--

03:14:11.279 --> 03:14:12.520
SAM: I just think did you--
MATT: At this point,

03:14:12.520 --> 03:14:17.387
you guys are now reaching the surface of the water,

03:14:17.387 --> 03:14:18.586
you guys are now reaching the surface of the water,

03:14:18.586 --> 03:14:20.577
which goes into the very toxic air.

03:14:20.577 --> 03:14:23.630
So you may have to take a deep breath of water

03:14:23.630 --> 03:14:25.520
before traversing and exiting.

03:14:25.520 --> 03:14:27.994
MARISHA: Let's put a pin in all of this, yeah.

03:14:27.994 --> 03:14:30.557
SAM: (mumbling)
LIAM: Breathe, Ed Harris, breathe.

03:14:30.557 --> 03:14:34.824
SAM: Was it a smooth gem?

03:14:34.824 --> 03:14:36.531
Like a smooth gem?

03:14:36.531 --> 03:14:38.584
Like a round sort of gem?

03:14:38.584 --> 03:14:40.146
LIAM: A smooth jam?

03:14:40.146 --> 03:14:42.248
MATT: "It was somewhat faceted.

03:14:42.248 --> 03:14:45.282
"It was worked.

03:14:45.282 --> 03:14:47.653
"I'm not very knowledgeable in the way of--"

03:14:47.653 --> 03:14:49.209
SAM: This big?

03:14:49.209 --> 03:14:51.047
MATT: "It was about that large."

03:14:51.047 --> 03:14:53.646
LAURA: This large?
MATT: "Yeah."

03:14:53.646 --> 03:14:56.542
LAURA: Like the Jewel of the Nile, like Romancing the Stone.

03:14:56.542 --> 03:14:58.373
MATT: "It was like a square-ish shape."

03:14:58.373 --> 03:15:00.880
SAM: Obviously, it's one of my favorite movies, sure.

03:15:00.880 --> 03:15:02.297
LIAM: Like Tusk Love?

03:15:04.370 --> 03:15:06.488
TALIESIN: All right, are we doing this?

03:15:06.488 --> 03:15:07.695
MATT: You guys all take a deep breath

03:15:07.695 --> 03:15:10.020
and she shows you take a deep breath of the water,

03:15:10.020 --> 03:15:12.783
and then all begin to make your way back

03:15:12.783 --> 03:15:14.771
through the way you came.

03:15:14.771 --> 03:15:18.804
I would like dexterity saving throws all around.

03:15:18.804 --> 03:15:23.669
Because you know of some of the things that are an issue,

03:15:23.669 --> 03:15:25.029
the DC is a little bit lower.

03:15:25.029 --> 03:15:26.794
So do not worry.

03:15:26.794 --> 03:15:28.853
TRAVIS: Get the fuck out of here.

03:15:28.853 --> 03:15:30.528
TALIESIN: Stop it.

03:15:30.528 --> 03:15:33.027
MATT: What you got, Fjord?

03:15:33.027 --> 03:15:36.997
TRAVIS: Five. My dexterity checks suck.

03:15:36.997 --> 03:15:39.962
MATT: You are climbing up on over one of the ledges,

03:15:39.962 --> 03:15:41.445
one of the ones you jumped off previously

03:15:41.445 --> 03:15:42.989
and wasn't an issue, as you're climbing up,

03:15:42.989 --> 03:15:46.010
part of the edge obsidian breaks, and as you do,

03:15:46.010 --> 03:15:48.901
chest slams into the edge, and you pull yourself up,

03:15:48.901 --> 03:15:51.011
but you lost two minutes of air.

03:15:51.011 --> 03:15:52.157
TRAVIS: Cool, back down to three.

03:15:52.157 --> 03:15:53.160
LAURA: 22.

03:15:53.160 --> 03:15:54.096
MATT: Nice.

03:15:54.096 --> 03:15:56.212
LIAM: Natural 20.

03:15:56.212 --> 03:15:57.847
SAM: 15.
MATT: All right.

03:15:57.847 --> 03:15:59.543
ASHLEY: 15.
MATT: All right.

03:15:59.543 --> 03:16:01.349
TALIESIN: Nine.

03:16:01.349 --> 03:16:02.616
MARISHA: Natural 20.

03:16:02.616 --> 03:16:03.891
TRAVIS: Damn.
MATT: All right.

03:16:03.891 --> 03:16:04.940
SAM: Ska-skow!

03:16:04.940 --> 03:16:09.940
MATT: So Caduceus, as you're all making your way through,

03:16:10.043 --> 03:16:12.423
you fall a little bit behind.
SAM: ♪ Making my way! ♪

03:16:12.423 --> 03:16:14.130
ASHLEY: ♪ Making my way! ♪

03:16:14.130 --> 03:16:16.142
MATT: You're starting to feel winded a bit.

03:16:16.142 --> 03:16:18.611
The heat's gotten to you, the waterlogged elements of it.

03:16:18.611 --> 03:16:21.465
You're squinting your eyes a bit as the water

03:16:21.465 --> 03:16:23.454
and sweat's mingling and burning your eyes a bit,

03:16:23.454 --> 03:16:25.584
and as you open up once more,

03:16:25.584 --> 03:16:27.485
you realize you've gone off course a little bit

03:16:27.485 --> 03:16:29.377
and shoulder checked the edge of one of the curves,

03:16:29.377 --> 03:16:31.358
and as you do (gasps), you exhale a bit.

03:16:31.358 --> 03:16:32.837
You lose two minutes of breath.

03:16:32.837 --> 03:16:35.496
LIAM: Dang it.
MATT: That puts you at?

03:16:35.496 --> 03:16:36.951
TALIESIN: It's constitution plus one?

03:16:36.951 --> 03:16:38.173
MATT: Yes.
TALIESIN: Two.

03:16:38.173 --> 03:16:40.357
MATT: Two, all right, so, as you guys are making,

03:16:40.357 --> 03:16:42.673
the air begins to clear up a little bit.

03:16:42.673 --> 03:16:45.141
I do need one constitution saving throw from you, Caduceus.

03:16:45.141 --> 03:16:46.167
TALIESIN: All right.

03:16:46.167 --> 03:16:47.694
TRAVIS: It's always Caduceus right now.

03:16:47.694 --> 03:16:49.693
LAURA: Yeah.
MATT: He's had a rough bout this island, man.

03:16:49.693 --> 03:16:52.543
LAURA: Yeah. This island ain't treating him right.
SAM: This island does not agree with him.

03:16:52.543 --> 03:16:53.493
TALIESIN: 20.

03:16:53.493 --> 03:16:54.980
ASHLEY: Okay, okay, okay.

03:16:54.980 --> 03:16:57.500
MATT: The toxin, it burns, but nevertheless,

03:16:57.500 --> 03:16:59.480
it passes without taking too much of a--

03:16:59.480 --> 03:17:00.718
TALIESIN: I remember this.

03:17:00.718 --> 03:17:01.624
MATT: -- of a terrible hold of the body.

03:17:01.624 --> 03:17:02.930
TALIESIN: I remember this.

03:17:02.930 --> 03:17:04.962
TRAVIS: (laughs)

03:17:04.962 --> 03:17:09.962
MATT: You guys eventually make your way towards the interior

03:17:10.268 --> 03:17:11.945
of where the cavern entrance is.

03:17:11.945 --> 03:17:16.074
You can see out now upon the night jungle,

03:17:16.074 --> 03:17:18.833
or you would be able to, but it's pitch black with elements

03:17:18.833 --> 03:17:23.158
of occasional bits of light,

03:17:23.158 --> 03:17:25.342
like little firebugs that occasionally dip

03:17:25.342 --> 03:17:28.105
through elements of jungle in the distance,

03:17:28.105 --> 03:17:30.422
but it is just black beyond that.

03:17:30.422 --> 03:17:33.812
You can hear the loud sounds of the insects

03:17:33.812 --> 03:17:37.221
and nocturnal creatures, now, that are beginning to create

03:17:37.221 --> 03:17:42.113
this beautiful, but also, hauntingly worrying

03:17:42.113 --> 03:17:45.329
symphony of unknown things

03:17:45.329 --> 03:17:49.381
that live throughout Rumblecusp,

03:17:49.381 --> 03:17:51.413
but you set up camp for the night here, I imagine.

03:17:51.413 --> 03:17:53.616
SAM: Yeah, yeah, are we going to do the dome?

03:17:53.616 --> 03:17:55.213
LIAM: Yeah, we're doming it up

03:17:55.213 --> 03:17:57.245
to camouflage with the surroundings.

03:17:57.245 --> 03:17:58.245
MATT: All right.

03:17:59.591 --> 03:18:01.650
Viridian asks, "Is there room for--"

03:18:01.650 --> 03:18:02.483
MARISHA: Yeah.

03:18:02.483 --> 03:18:03.316
MATT: "If you don't mind."

03:18:03.316 --> 03:18:04.781
LAURA: Cuddle up.

03:18:04.781 --> 03:18:05.947
TALIESIN: As long as you don't mind,

03:18:05.947 --> 03:18:07.630
we have a little good night ritual that we do

03:18:07.630 --> 03:18:10.553
before we go to sleep and when we wake up every morning.

03:18:10.553 --> 03:18:11.386
MARISHA: For sure.

03:18:11.386 --> 03:18:14.802
LAURA: We all hold each other's hands,

03:18:14.802 --> 03:18:18.268
and we sing a song talking

03:18:18.268 --> 03:18:20.621
about what we're thankful for that day.

03:18:20.621 --> 03:18:21.854
SAM: Oh my god.

03:18:21.854 --> 03:18:24.105
Jester already forgot the nightly ritual.

03:18:24.105 --> 03:18:25.120
(laughter)

03:18:25.120 --> 03:18:27.870
MATT: Make a deception check, Jester.

03:18:31.912 --> 03:18:34.153
SAM: The new member of the group leads it, though.

03:18:34.153 --> 03:18:36.836
TALIESIN: No, we'll do it last.

03:18:36.836 --> 03:18:38.674
LAURA: 11.

03:18:38.674 --> 03:18:43.490
MATT: 11. Viridian looks at you oddly.

03:18:43.490 --> 03:18:45.949
LAURA: You can start singing if you want to.

03:18:45.949 --> 03:18:47.280
TALIESIN: You're learning, that's good.

03:18:47.280 --> 03:18:49.309
You're one of us now. Yeah, this is just--

03:18:49.309 --> 03:18:50.803
MATT: "I'm all right.

03:18:50.803 --> 03:18:53.732
"I don't think I need to partake in this ritual."

03:18:55.132 --> 03:18:58.025
TALIESIN: So we don't have to repeat it, obviously,

03:18:58.025 --> 03:19:02.007
but we'll go down the line, say our names,

03:19:02.007 --> 03:19:03.626
talk about our parents.
LAURA: Oh, that ritual.

03:19:03.626 --> 03:19:06.032
SAM: Yeah, see you already forgot it.

03:19:06.032 --> 03:19:08.677
TALIESIN: Oh no, it's taken her.

03:19:08.677 --> 03:19:11.680
And before it gets to her turn,

03:19:11.680 --> 03:19:14.378
I'm going to cast Greater Restoration.

03:19:14.378 --> 03:19:15.703
MATT: Okay!

03:19:16.830 --> 03:19:18.197
LIAM: Oh, shit.

03:19:19.109 --> 03:19:21.450
MARISHA: Come on.
MATT: Make a sleight of hand check for me.

03:19:21.450 --> 03:19:22.670
LIAM: Shit.

03:19:22.670 --> 03:19:23.503
ASHLEY: Come on.

03:19:23.503 --> 03:19:24.992
TALIESIN: Okay, I wasn't being sneaky about it.

03:19:24.992 --> 03:19:26.819
I was just doing it.

03:19:26.819 --> 03:19:28.568
MATT: I know, well, casting a spell like this is less

03:19:28.568 --> 03:19:32.123
of, like, a touch and it's more of like a incantation

03:19:32.123 --> 03:19:32.956
and then a place.

03:19:32.956 --> 03:19:35.906
So it is still a very visible thing,

03:19:35.906 --> 03:19:37.977
and to surprise somebody with that,

03:19:37.977 --> 03:19:39.157
if somebody wants to try and distract,

03:19:39.157 --> 03:19:40.024
they can probably aid with that,

03:19:40.024 --> 03:19:40.939
but that would be the extent of it.

03:19:40.939 --> 03:19:42.314
LAURA: I'll distract her.

03:19:42.314 --> 03:19:44.340
MATT: Okay, how are you distracting her?

03:19:44.340 --> 03:19:47.631
LAURA: ♪ Today, what I'm thankful for is ♪

03:19:47.631 --> 03:19:49.531
♪ that we got to see ♪

03:19:49.531 --> 03:19:53.993
♪ you do all the really cool stuff with the plants ♪

03:19:53.993 --> 03:19:55.916
TALIESIN: Seven.
MATT: Make a persuasion check.

03:19:55.916 --> 03:19:57.367
ASHLEY: Can I assist her?

03:19:57.367 --> 03:19:59.478
MATT: Well, no, if you're assisting,

03:19:59.478 --> 03:20:00.486
that gives you advantage, sorry.

03:20:00.486 --> 03:20:02.220
LAURA: Oh, okay, good. (laughs)

03:20:02.220 --> 03:20:03.377
SAM: That was horrible.

03:20:03.377 --> 03:20:05.603
TRAVIS: Were you going to whip out the bone saw?

03:20:05.603 --> 03:20:07.450
SAM: (squeals)

03:20:07.450 --> 03:20:09.375
TALIESIN: No, seven.

03:20:09.375 --> 03:20:10.591
LAURA: Oh!

03:20:10.591 --> 03:20:12.227
MATT: Okay, as you're singing,

03:20:12.227 --> 03:20:15.823
she looks a little put off by this,

03:20:15.823 --> 03:20:18.241
and as you begin to reach out for, she rears back and says

03:20:18.241 --> 03:20:20.058
"What are you doing?"

03:20:20.058 --> 03:20:21.188
TALIESIN: Part of the ritual.

03:20:21.188 --> 03:20:24.079
It'll be fine, and I tap.

03:20:25.129 --> 03:20:28.770
MATT: Make a dexterity check.

03:20:28.770 --> 03:20:30.143
This is now her trying to recoil from you

03:20:30.143 --> 03:20:31.076
before you can get to her.

03:20:31.076 --> 03:20:33.898
You are now reaching out.

03:20:33.898 --> 03:20:36.329
She noticed, then she's on the defense.

03:20:36.329 --> 03:20:37.915
SAM: Spell, dispel.

03:20:37.915 --> 03:20:41.843
TALIESIN: 17, dexterity check? 17.
MATT: Check.

03:20:41.843 --> 03:20:43.593
MATT: 17?

03:20:44.792 --> 03:20:46.258
That wins.

03:20:47.525 --> 03:20:50.051
So you reach out and touch her with the final elements

03:20:50.051 --> 03:20:52.179
of the ritual.
SAM: On her shoulder.

03:20:52.179 --> 03:20:53.012
TALIESIN: Yeah.

03:20:53.012 --> 03:20:55.262
(laughter)

03:20:56.933 --> 03:20:57.827
TALIESIN: Your turn.

03:20:57.827 --> 03:21:00.760
LIAM: (like Caduceus) Sorry about that.
TALIESIN: Sorry.

03:21:00.760 --> 03:21:05.411
MATT: As you touch her, her eyes glaze over for a moment,

03:21:05.411 --> 03:21:08.339
then her eyelids close, and you see the flickering

03:21:08.339 --> 03:21:11.558
of rapid eye movement from beneath the eyelids.

03:21:11.558 --> 03:21:13.987
You see sweat begin to pour from the brow,

03:21:13.987 --> 03:21:18.945
and her arms begin to dig into the rock around her.

03:21:18.945 --> 03:21:20.587
and her arms begin to dig into the rock around her.

03:21:20.587 --> 03:21:24.776
You watch as the wind that surround the base of the floor

03:21:24.776 --> 03:21:28.005
around her begin to whip up a bit, and her hair (blows)

03:21:28.005 --> 03:21:31.163
drifts as it begins to encircle.

03:21:31.163 --> 03:21:33.873
Eventually, her eyes open.

03:21:33.873 --> 03:21:36.053
"(panting)

03:21:36.053 --> 03:21:37.569
"Oh no.

03:21:40.939 --> 03:21:42.639
"I'm so sorry.

03:21:44.408 --> 03:21:45.825
"This has to stop."

03:21:46.725 --> 03:21:47.909
TALIESIN: We know.

03:21:47.909 --> 03:21:51.003
TRAVIS: What has to stop?

03:21:51.003 --> 03:21:53.875
MATT: "What this thing is doing to all of us."

03:21:53.875 --> 03:21:56.064
LAURA: What, how long have you been here?

03:21:56.064 --> 03:21:57.225
What has he done to you?

03:21:57.225 --> 03:21:59.357
MARISHA: Where are you from?

03:21:59.357 --> 03:22:01.424
TALIESIN: Easy.
MARISHA: Sorry.

03:22:02.522 --> 03:22:06.831
MATT: "I've been here 25 years.

03:22:10.531 --> 03:22:12.998
"I'm not Viridian."

03:22:13.964 --> 03:22:15.602
ASHLEY: What?

03:22:15.602 --> 03:22:18.185
MATT: "I'm from Tal'Dorei.

03:22:18.185 --> 03:22:19.651
"My name is Vilya."

03:22:19.651 --> 03:22:21.859
SAM: Yeah!

03:22:21.859 --> 03:22:22.896
MATT: And that's where we'll end tonight's episode.

03:22:22.896 --> 03:22:25.063
(yelling)

03:22:26.968 --> 03:22:28.328
TALIESIN: Boom!

03:22:28.328 --> 03:22:29.270
Worth it, worth it!

03:22:29.270 --> 03:22:30.758
MATT: Okay, so, at the end, she said she's from--

03:22:30.758 --> 03:22:32.795
SAM: You guys know who that is, right?

03:22:32.795 --> 03:22:34.951
TRAVIS: -- from Tal'Dorei and she's from where?

03:22:34.951 --> 03:22:36.393
MARISHA: Vilya?

03:22:36.393 --> 03:22:37.551
ASHLEY: Azalea is her name?

03:22:37.551 --> 03:22:39.330
MATT: Vilya.
ALL: Vilya.

03:22:39.330 --> 03:22:41.361
LAURA: Who's Vilya?

03:22:41.361 --> 03:22:42.327
TALIESIN: Oh my god, the council.

03:22:42.327 --> 03:22:44.411
SAM: Nope.
TRAVIS: What?

03:22:44.411 --> 03:22:45.244
TRAVIS: No.

03:22:45.244 --> 03:22:46.580
SAM: Come on.
MARISHA: Wait.

03:22:46.580 --> 03:22:47.620
TALIESIN: What?
SAM: Come on.

03:22:47.620 --> 03:22:49.200
MARISHA: My mom?
SAM: Yeah!

03:22:49.200 --> 03:22:52.085
LAURA: (gasps)
TRAVIS: Oh my god!

03:22:52.085 --> 03:22:54.211
MARISHA: My mom?
TALIESIN: No fucking way!

03:22:54.211 --> 03:22:55.959
MARISHA: It's not Keyleth's mom!

03:22:55.959 --> 03:22:58.776
You cannot do this to me!

03:22:58.776 --> 03:22:59.712
LAURA: She's a druid!

03:22:59.712 --> 03:23:04.712
(laughter)
MARISHA: [Inaudible] will be fine!

03:23:04.771 --> 03:23:05.767
SAM: You knew it?

03:23:05.767 --> 03:23:07.838
He's the one that got it.
SAM: I found out 10 minutes ago,

03:23:07.838 --> 03:23:09.171
and I told Liam.

03:23:11.496 --> 03:23:13.638
MARISHA: Oh my god.
ASHLEY: How did you find out 10 minutes ago?

03:23:13.638 --> 03:23:16.008
MARISHA: She's a crazy fucking druid, that's why.

03:23:16.008 --> 03:23:20.344
She's a crazy fucking druid.
TRAVIS: That just totally disappeared.

03:23:20.344 --> 03:23:22.587
MARISHA: And got sucked in through the Water Plane!

03:23:22.587 --> 03:23:24.184
What is happening?!

03:23:24.184 --> 03:23:26.173
(laughter)

03:23:26.173 --> 03:23:27.390
What?

03:23:27.390 --> 03:23:28.683
TALIESIN: Well, you broke Marisha.

03:23:28.683 --> 03:23:30.387
I hope you're happy.
LIAM: Fucking genius.

03:23:30.387 --> 03:23:34.137
SAM: Genius level shit, Matthew Mercer, genius.

03:23:34.137 --> 03:23:36.261
TALIESIN: Oh, I'm so glad I did that.

03:23:36.261 --> 03:23:39.251
MATT: Sitting on that since Campaign 1 began.

03:23:39.251 --> 03:23:40.763
ASHLEY: Oh my god.

03:23:40.763 --> 03:23:42.438
SAM: So good.

03:23:42.438 --> 03:23:43.452
TALIESIN: We are fucked.

03:23:43.452 --> 03:23:44.641
SAM: So good.

03:23:44.641 --> 03:23:46.105
LAURA: So wait, wait, in the first campaign,

03:23:46.105 --> 03:23:47.686
if we'd have come to Rumblecusp.

03:23:47.686 --> 03:23:50.494
if we'd have come over this way, we could've found her?

03:23:50.494 --> 03:23:53.013
MATT: Possibly, but you had no reason to.

03:23:53.013 --> 03:23:54.555
MARISHA: We would've had to have come this way.

03:23:54.555 --> 03:23:57.009
ASHLEY: She's been here for 25 years?
LIAM: This is the other side of the planet.

03:23:57.009 --> 03:24:00.850
TRAVIS: It doesn't matter because Keyleth is still totally,

03:24:00.850 --> 03:24:03.351
essentially the same age.
MARISHA: Alive, yeah!

03:24:03.351 --> 03:24:06.284
Keyleth is definitely still kicking!
LAURA: Keyleth could have her mom back!

03:24:06.284 --> 03:24:08.988
MARISHA: (yells)

03:24:08.988 --> 03:24:10.135
LIAM: Fucking amazing.

03:24:10.135 --> 03:24:12.615
MARISHA: I thought my mom was dead!

03:24:12.615 --> 03:24:14.524
They said my mom was dead.
TRAVIS: Everybody thinks you're dead.

03:24:14.524 --> 03:24:17.910
LAURA: Oh, and Vilya has the leg, the leg.

03:24:17.910 --> 03:24:19.984
That's all they ever found was her leg!

03:24:19.984 --> 03:24:22.205
Why didn't we realize that earlier?!

03:24:22.205 --> 03:24:25.755
TRAVIS: She's got the fucking vine for a leg!

03:24:25.755 --> 03:24:27.077
SAM: We didn't know that she had lost a leg.

03:24:27.077 --> 03:24:28.519
LIAM: Yes, we did.
SAM: We did?!

03:24:28.519 --> 03:24:29.354
MATT: Yeah.

03:24:29.354 --> 03:24:32.054
MARISHA: Yeah, because they said that
she went into the Water Plane--

03:24:32.054 --> 03:24:33.770
LIAM: All they found was her leg.

03:24:33.770 --> 03:24:35.545
MARISHA: She failed her trial.

03:24:35.545 --> 03:24:38.207
ASHLEY: Oh my god.
MARISHA: So! So is this thing

03:24:38.207 --> 03:24:40.348
a fucked up kraken?

03:24:40.348 --> 03:24:41.884
Is that all this thing is?

03:24:41.884 --> 03:24:43.815
TALIESIN: We don't know.
TRAVIS: We have no idea.

03:24:43.815 --> 03:24:45.988
LIAM: I mean, we don't need to know the specifics yet,

03:24:45.988 --> 03:24:48.415
it just means that your mom fell into the Bermuda Triangle.

03:24:48.415 --> 03:24:49.755
LAURA: Oh my god.
MARISHA: Yeah.

03:24:49.755 --> 03:24:51.927
TRAVIS: Dude, who the fuck are these other people?

03:24:51.927 --> 03:24:54.828
LIAM: Fucking genius, fucking genius.
SAM: What is so funny

03:24:54.828 --> 03:24:57.106
and amazing to me, I mean,

03:24:57.106 --> 03:24:59.905
we are the most suspicious people,

03:24:59.905 --> 03:25:02.403
and it didn't occur to any of us.

03:25:02.403 --> 03:25:05.412
MARISHA: No, because it was in another campaign!
TRAVIS: When did you figure it out?

03:25:05.412 --> 03:25:08.059
SAM: Right like 15, 20 minutes ago,

03:25:08.059 --> 03:25:10.737
I just glanced down to see how many people are watching

03:25:10.737 --> 03:25:12.884
our show at the end of the night,

03:25:12.884 --> 03:25:15.563
and in chat, flying by--
LIAM: In the past.

03:25:15.563 --> 03:25:17.638
SAM: -- flying by, somebody goes,

03:25:17.638 --> 03:25:20.438
"I think that's Keyleth's mom."

03:25:20.438 --> 03:25:23.209
LAURA: Everybody figured it out?!
MARISHA: So it wasn't--

03:25:23.209 --> 03:25:25.692
SAM: And I was like, what?

03:25:25.692 --> 03:25:26.663
Oh fuck!

03:25:26.663 --> 03:25:28.067
(laughter)

03:25:28.067 --> 03:25:29.781
LIAM: Sam texted me and then I was like,

03:25:29.781 --> 03:25:31.180
"We got to share this with M," He went, "No!"

03:25:31.180 --> 03:25:32.528
And I went, "Why, it's Beau!"

03:25:32.528 --> 03:25:34.275
And I sent it to you like 10 minutes ago,

03:25:34.926 --> 03:25:36.849
but you never saw it.
MARISHA: No, I'm not looking

03:25:36.849 --> 03:25:38.296
at my phone.

03:25:38.296 --> 03:25:39.454
LAURA: Oh my god!

03:25:39.454 --> 03:25:41.297
MATT: I'm so glad you didn't see it out there.

03:25:41.297 --> 03:25:43.113
LIAM: We can't whisper to each other

03:25:43.113 --> 03:25:44.896
because we're not next to each other!
TALIESIN: I've been holding onto that Greater Restoration

03:25:44.896 --> 03:25:46.670
the whole goddamn day!

03:25:46.670 --> 03:25:47.614
MATT: And you know what?

03:25:47.614 --> 03:25:48.821
ASHLEY: That was amazing.
LIAM: Amazing.

03:25:48.821 --> 03:25:51.045
SAM: So good, Matt, so good.

03:25:51.045 --> 03:25:53.447
MATT: Well, you guys, that was an awesome session.

03:25:53.447 --> 03:25:55.555
I'm excited for the next one.
TRAVIS: Oh my god!

03:25:55.555 --> 03:25:56.619
TALIESIN: (cackles)

03:25:56.619 --> 03:25:58.595
MATT: All righty.
LAURA: I'm blown away.

03:25:58.595 --> 03:26:01.311
MATT: Well, on that note--
SAM: Wait, we're still playing?

03:26:01.311 --> 03:26:02.684
LIAM: Yes, we're still on.
MATT: We're still on.

03:26:02.684 --> 03:26:04.226
SAM: We're on?
MATT: Yeah, I haven't closed it yet.

03:26:04.226 --> 03:26:05.637
MARISHA: We're still fucking going.

03:26:05.637 --> 03:26:07.336
(laughter)

03:26:07.336 --> 03:26:09.220
MATT: So on that note--
MARISHA: Oh my god!

03:26:09.220 --> 03:26:10.899
SAM: Now we're done?
MATT and TALIESIN: No.

03:26:10.899 --> 03:26:12.459
ASHLEY: I want to keep playing!

03:26:12.459 --> 03:26:14.880
MATT: We'll see you see guys in the next episode.

03:26:14.880 --> 03:26:15.990
LIAM: 20 more hours.

03:26:15.990 --> 03:26:17.593
MATT: Thank you for joining us.
ASHLEY: Four more hours!

03:26:17.593 --> 03:26:19.210
MATT: Remember, guys--
TRAVIS and ASHLEY: (chanting) Four more hours!

03:26:19.210 --> 03:26:20.599
Four more hours!
MATT: I know.

03:26:20.599 --> 03:26:24.011
MARISHA: What's Korrin going to think?! Ah!

03:26:24.011 --> 03:26:25.123
Is Korrin still alive?

03:26:25.123 --> 03:26:27.035
LIAM: We don't know Korrin.
MARISHA: (yells)

03:26:27.035 --> 03:26:28.209
LIAM: You don't know Korrin!

03:26:28.209 --> 03:26:30.875
MARISHA: No, but Marisha knows Korrin as Keyleth

03:26:30.875 --> 03:26:32.054
as my past life.
LIAM: Who's Marisha?

03:26:32.054 --> 03:26:33.712
TRAVIS: We don't know Tal'Dorei at all.

03:26:33.712 --> 03:26:37.124
MARISHA: It all's blurry. Who's on the Tal'Dorei council?
MATT: None of you have been there.

03:26:37.124 --> 03:26:38.541
TRAVIS: We know Allura, that's it.

03:26:38.541 --> 03:26:41.310
MATT: Anyway, have a wonderful week, guys.

03:26:41.310 --> 03:26:44.033
We love you very much, and is it Thursday yet?

03:26:44.033 --> 03:26:48.359
Good night. (laughs)
(yelling)
